Instead of sharing the inspiring story of a human being leading sustainable change, I am sharing some wisdom for a little puppy named Polly!</p><p>This last year we were foster parents or \u201cpuppy raisers\u201d for a guide dog puppy. That meant volunteering our home, time and energy to socialise a little Labrador puppy before she goes off to school where she is trained as a guide dog for the blind or as an assistant dog for people who use wheelchairs.</p><p>This adorable little ball of fluff turned our lives upside down and to my surprise taught me an awful lot about life and leadership along the way. So, I decided to summarise my top 10 lessons from Polly the puppy to share with you here.\u00a0</p><p>This episode also includes some reflections and food for thought that I hope offer you some new insights into how you live and lead!</p><p>Here are the lessons Polly wants to share with you on this episode:</p><ol><li><b>Learning is play and play is learning</b></li><li><b>Resolve to begin again</b></li><li><b>Learn to face your fears</b></li><li><b>This too shall pass</b></li><li><b>Don\u2019t miss the joy in the small things</b></li><li><b>Face things when they are little or they will grow big and bite you</b></li><li><b>Don\u2019t always hold leash so tight</b></li><li><b>Stop and smell the roses, and the poop.

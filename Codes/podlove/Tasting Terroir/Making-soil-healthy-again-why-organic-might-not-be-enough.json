Just what does it take to restore unhealthy soil? \u00a0 How can understanding regenerative agriculture empower you to find the flavorful, healthy food you are looking for despite a sea of misleading marketing?<br /><br />**********************<br />Last week we discussed what we mean when we say Tasting Terroir.\u00a0 My co-host Dr. Jill Clapperton,\u00a0 a soil scientist and plant physiologist, explained how the flavor of food is connected to many factors \u2013\u00a0 including most likely, the way it was grown and the health of the soil the food was grown in.<br /><br />This week,\u00a0 we dive into understanding what makes soil healthy and what it takes to restore unhealthy soil. \u00a0<br /><br />To start, I will give you an overview of the principles of regenerative agriculture -\u00a0 a way of farming that restores and renews the health of the soil by working with nature instead of against her.\u00a0<br /><br />Finally, we will hear more from my interview with Dr. Jill Clapperton about a challenge to soil health that is widely used in both conventional and organic farming systems \u2013 tillage \u2013 or plowing up the land to plant a new crop \u2013 and how this practice compares to the use of applying chemicals.<br /><br /></p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tastingterroir\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show</a><p><b>Brought to you by the </b><a href=\"https://www.jillclapperton.com\"><b>Global Food and Farm Online Community</b></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://tastingterroir.buzzsprout.com/share\"><b>Click here </b></a>to subscribe on your favorite platform or <a href=\"https://tastingterroir.buzzsprout.com\"><b>click here </b></a>to listen on our website. <br /><b><br />Support the show through Patreon -- </b><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tastingterroir\"><b>Patreon.com/TastingTerroir</b></a></p>", "publicationDate": "Wed, 24 Aug 2022 22:00:00 -0400", "duration": "1220", "poster": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0c655a_b260b8cf3e1c4d30aaa970cdd38e742c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1277,h_753,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/0c655a_b260b8cf3e1c4d30aaa970cdd38e742c~mv2.jpg", "link": "https://www.jillclapperton.com", "audio": [{"url": "https://www.buzzsprout.com/1857893/11200177-making-soil-healthy-again-why-organic-might-not-be-enough.mp3", "size": "14679987", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Sara (Hessenflow) Harper"}]}

We begin talking to Juani Lisboa, part of a natural cider-making collective in Chile - Agricola sin Patrones -  who are working to support more diverse rural ecosystems. Then our co-creator Abby Rose puts her Vidacycle hat on and talks to agroecologist Nicole Masters about a powerful new tool they worked on together - the Soilmentor Regen Platform - which uses the 10 Regen Indicators to help farmers learn from their in-field observations. And finally we hear from two people working closely with Bruichladdich Distillery on Islay. Richard Gantlett at Yatesbury House Farm supplies the distillery with biodynamic barley, and Christy MacFarlane works in their comms department. She shares about the distillery's work with growing landrace barley on the Hebridean Islands where they are based.\n\nEpisode Links:\nAgricola sin Patrones\nhttps://www.instagram.com/agricola_sinpatrones/ \n\nNicole Masters x Vidacycle = the Soilmentor Regen Platform\nhttps://www.integritysoils.co.nz/\nhttps://soils.vidacycle.com/\n\nRichard Gantlett, Yatesbury House Farm\nhttps://yatesbury.wixsite.com/yatesbury\nBruichladdich Distillery\nhttps://www.bruichladdich.com/", "publicationDate": "Sun, 27 Mar 2022 10:53:35 +0000", "duration": "00:33:43", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-GTFym54QL3fUVd6z-FaY71A-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1239609844-farmerama-radio-73-chilean-natural-cider-the-regen-platform-and-biodynamic-whiskey.mp3", "size": "32378879", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

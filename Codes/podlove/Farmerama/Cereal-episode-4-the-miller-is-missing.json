And of the wheat that did become flour in our homes and bakeries, most of that flour had to have nutrients added back into it - by law - because it was almost nutritionless by the time it came out of the mill. \n\nIn episode 4 we ask how did the milling process lead us to producing flour with almost no nutritional value? And why would the majority of the wheat grown in the UK go to animal feed?\nWe meet millers around the UK who are doing things differently, providing flour with terroir, flour that is fresh and filled with nutrition, using locally grown heritage varieties that are benefiting people and planet.\n\nThe radical changes that bread has undergone are revealing of much wider truths about our relationships with food, to farmers, with the land, the environment, and with each other. If you eat food, you have a stake in this story.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 15 Dec 2019 15:15:21 +0000", "duration": "00:42:21", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000652421548-cico16-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-4-the-miller-is-missing", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/728181913-farmerama-radio-cereal-episode-4-the-miller-is-missing.mp3", "size": "61062418", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

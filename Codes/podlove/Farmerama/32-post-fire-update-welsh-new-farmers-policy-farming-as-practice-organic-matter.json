We head to a farm in Wales to learn how planning legislation is opening doors for people wanting to produce, and live sustainably. Then we head to the US to hear how one farmer is taking a philosophical approach to sharing the practice of farming and connecting to the land. And finally, back on British soil to hear from a long-time soil scientist about organic matter. Plus if you listen to the very end you will hear a nice teaser about an exciting opportunity in Scotland.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 25 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000", "duration": "00:36:03", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000321600045-u45dtx-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/32-post-fire-update-welsh-new-farmers-policy-farming-as-practice-organic-matter", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/417506970-farmerama-radio-32-post-fire-update-welsh-new-farmers-policy-farming-as-practice-organic-matter.mp3", "size": "34683133", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

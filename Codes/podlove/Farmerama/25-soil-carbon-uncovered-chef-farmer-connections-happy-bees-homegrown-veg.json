We get to the bottom of carbon cycles and learn what it really takes to build humus. Bees buzz happily as they are allowed to express their characteristics in alternative beekeeping methods and finally you\u2019re invited to get involved in a citizen science project that celebrates allotments and home-grown veg. Thanks to E5 Bakehouse for supporting this show, we love their commitment to working with farmers to grow heritage grains locally, mill them on-site and produce the best loaf of bread.", "publicationDate": "Sat, 26 Aug 2017 20:49:01 +0000", "duration": "00:29:55", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000240017894-ru7unt-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/25-farmerama", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/339623519-farmerama-radio-25-farmerama.mp3", "size": "43153981", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

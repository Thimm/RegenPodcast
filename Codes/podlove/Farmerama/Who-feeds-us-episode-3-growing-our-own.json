In towns and cities across the UK, those of us lucky enough to have access to gardens or balconies \u2013 even if we\u2019d never grown anything before \u2013 suddenly started looking for compost, tools, and seeds.\n\nMany of us discovered, perhaps for the first time, the joy of eating freshly picked, homegrown fruit and veg. It\u2019s a joy that you just don\u2019t get when you bite into something that\u2019s been harvested unripe on the other side of the world, flown across oceans to be processed somewhere else, then eventually picked up from a supermarket chiller here in the UK \u2013 maybe weeks later.\n\nBut, to grow your own food, the first thing you need are seeds. For millennia \u2013 for the vast majority of our agricultural history, in fact \u2013 farmers saved their own seed. Over time, plants adapted to the specifics of the area they were growing in, and local varieties emerged. But when seed companies developed F1 hybrids, which can\u2019t be harvested and re-sown year after year, things changed. The genetics of these hybrids are too unstable \u2013 there\u2019s no knowing how your crop will turn out. So farmers and growers reliant on F1 hybrids have to buy their seeds every single year.\n\nBy saving and sharing open-pollinated seed, farmers and growers \u2013 and communities \u2013 are helping make sure our food supply can withstand the shocks of climate change. And, they\u2019re also reclaiming collective control of the seeds we all depend on to feed ourselves \u2013 ensuring that we all have access to those seeds, even during a crisis \u2013 like a pandemic.\n\nFeaturing:\nAstrid Guillabeau:\nNeville Portas: https://nodiggitygdns.wordpress.com/ \nDee Woods: https://granvillecommunitykitchen.wordpress.com/\nHelene Schulze: https://www.seedsovereignty.info/ \n\nFarmerama.co\nProducer: Alice Armstrong\nExecutive Producers: Jo Barratt, Katie Revell, Abby Rose\nCommunity Collaborators: Andre Reid, Dhelia Snoussi\nProject Manager: Olivia Oldham\nArtwork: Hannah Grace www.hgraceoc.com/\nMusic: Michael O'Neil\nPR & Comms: Fran Bailey, Kate Lam, Elma Glasgow, Nancy Brownlow\n\nWho Feeds Us? is possible thanks to the Farming the Future COVID Response Fund.

Firstly we hear from Andre Miguel of Hortas de Cascais about how community gardens have spread across a whole region in Portugal. Next, we head to Amaqanda Learning Garden in Philippi Village, South Africa where we speak to Yanga Gceya of Captain Fanplastic about how kids are connecting with their ecosystem by becoming plastic pirates. Then, we\u2019re in Bulgaria where we hear from Filip Harmandzhiev, owner of Livadi farm, about an interesting membership model for his farm shop. Finally we\u2019re back in the UK, to Kingsclere Estates, to chat to Tim May about a farming approach that layers and connects many businesses on one farm. \n\nThis episode of Farmerama was made by me, Abby Rose and Jo Barratt. A big thanks to the rest of the farmerama team Olivia Oldham, Katie Revell, Dora Taylor, Fran Bailey, Annie Landless and Eliza Jenkins . Our theme music is by Owen Barratt.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 27 Nov 2022 17:31:55 +0000", "duration": "00:34:11", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-NFJ2EJeo5PeUHyXV-AvuOsQ-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/77-community-gardens-plastic-pirates-a-farmshop-club-and-a-multi-business-farm", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1391456323-farmerama-radio-77-community-gardens-plastic-pirates-a-farmshop-club-and-a-multi-business-farm.mp3", "size": "32822751", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

From an old friend of the show, we learned a few grazing tips, including how to use animals to remineralise the land. We learn about the benefits and challenges of setting up a silvopasture system, and get to join in on a sustainable wine tasting session in Sicily. \n\nThanks to Rebel Kitchen for supporting this episode.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 24 Feb 2019 10:16:37 +0000", "duration": "00:35:04", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000493960191-uv0xpu-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-43", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/580418379-farmerama-radio-farmerama-43.mp3", "size": "33726424", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

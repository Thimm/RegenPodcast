We\u2019ll hear a conversation with him from 2017 about the OurField Project. We then hear from the Kindling Trust. They work on a range of projects that model a fairer, more responsible, ecologically restorative food system, and are opening up an opportunity to invest in their new farming endeavours in Manchester. Next, farmer John Turner introduces us to a new vision of dairy farming- a vegetarian dairy farm producing cow\u2019s milk alongside innovative naked oat mylk. Tiger and Float are making this oat mylk, using the naked oats that John is growing. Finally we meet Mohammed Ruzzi, a fair trade farmer in Palestine, who talks to us about the role of regenerative farming and the Zaytoun cooperative in supporting a better life for Palestinian farmers.", "publicationDate": "Mon, 26 Apr 2021 01:44:02 +0000", "duration": "00:35:55", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-Tbd9G3rY8xtxPf6g-rCX21w-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1036670809-farmerama-radio-65_community_farm_investment_naked_oat_mylk_and_palestinian_fair_trade.mp3", "size": "34495424", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

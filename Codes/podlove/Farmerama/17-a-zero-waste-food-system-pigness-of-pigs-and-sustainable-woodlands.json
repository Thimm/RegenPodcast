He tells us how his zero-waste philosophy has transformed what it means to serve food, and a local pig-farmer tells us what it\u2019s like to work with a zero-waste chef. In Norfolk we learn all about the craft of managing ancient woodland sustainably and profitably, now and for many generations to come. Finally farming celebrity Joel Salatin tells us about respecting the pigness of the pig and what future technology he hopes to see.", "publicationDate": "Sat, 11 Mar 2017 09:13:05 +0000", "duration": "00:37:20", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000212037630-zhmigj-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/311830425-farmerama-radio-17-farmerama.mp3", "size": "35842217", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

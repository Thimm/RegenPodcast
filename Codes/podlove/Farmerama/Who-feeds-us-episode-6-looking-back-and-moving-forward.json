We tease out some common threads that bind these apparently disparate voices together \u2013 threads such as reverence, gratitude, sovereignty, dignity and abundance. We hear more about what these people have learnt over the course of this year, their visions for resilient, localised food economies... and how they see the future of who feeds us. \n\nIt is clearer than ever: Food is not just a question of calories. Food is nourishment for the body and soul. Food is about community, culture and our relationship with each other and with the Earth. We are all part of the food system.\n\nThe journey ahead \u2013 towards a truly resilient, humane and nourishing food system, a food system rooted in abundance \u2013 that journey is complicated, and it will most likely be bumpy. But this series is an invitation to embrace that complexity, to dive into it, to seek out and connect with those who feed us. After all \u2013 food doesn\u2019t come from shelves. Food comes from the soil, the sea \u2013 and the hands of people. This is who feeds us.\n\nFeaturing:\nSkye Gyngell: https://springrestaurant-shop.co.uk/\nJane Scotter: http://fernverrow.com/\nSalma & Khalil Attan: https://www.bushwoodbees.co.uk/ // https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVrsm10F2zp_KO26MBCGRUw\nUrsula Myrie: https://www.adira.org.uk/\nAngus Buchanan-Smith: https://www.the-free-company.com/\nDee Woods: https://granvillecommunitykitchen.wordpress.com/\nDr Lisa Palmer: https://www.bcu.ac.uk/social-sciences/sociology/staff/lisa-palmer\nMuhsen Hassanin: https://abrahamshalalmeat.com/\nAbigail Holsborough: https://www.brixtonwindmill.org/\nRosy Benson: www.fieldbakery.com/\nLynda McFarlane: https://veganvybes.co.uk/\n\nFarmerama.co\nProducers: Jo Barratt, Katie Revell, Abby Rose, Suzie McCarthy\nAdditional interview: Lovejit Dhaliwal\nSeries Executive Producers: Jo Barratt, Katie Revell, Abby Rose\nCommunity Collaborators: Cathy St Germans, Zain Dada,  Andre Reid\nProject Manager: Olivia Oldham\nArtwork: Hannah Grace www.hgraceoc.com/\nMusic: Michael O'Neil\nPR & Comms: Fran Bailey, Kate Lam, Elma Glasgow, Nancy Brownlow\n\nWho Feeds Us? is possible thanks to the Farming the Future COVID Response Fund.

These conditions are ideal for the study of Eh.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eh, the short notation for redox potential, is a measurement of the availability of electrons, whereas pH is a measurement of the availability of protons. In order to gain a full picture of the soil\u2019s nutrient profile, we need to assess both the pH and the redox potential at the same time.\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this interview, Olivier details:\u00a0</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the difference between Eh and pH\u00a0</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how the Eh profile changes based on photosynthetic activity\u00a0</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how electrons in the soil are key to reversing oxidation and absorbing nutrition from soil mineral reserves</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how Eh determines water absorption capacity</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how the whole plant is regulated by the redox signal\u00a0</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Eh and pH parameters that are present when pathogenic fungi, bacteria, and viruses manifest in a plant and cause disease.\u00a0</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John and Olivier have also presented on the topic of redox in a 6-hour course format, including graphs and visuals, which is available as a part of the Regen Ag Academy.

We have stories from Perthshire to Devon but we start on the west coast, with Patrick Holden from the Sustainable Food Trust. Patrick tells us about how he makes the most of the by-products from his dairy farm, and what a positive effect transparent pricing could have on farmers. We hear about a great little trick for soil testing on the cheap, the TBI \u2013 And then we are in Shropshire to find out about some of the ups and downs of Woofing. Finally, we get a collection of dispatches from the first Scottish Farmhack, an experience that had many people excited to share ideas and build tools together.", "publicationDate": "Fri, 10 Mar 2017 18:45:43 +0000", "duration": "00:27:27", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000211939252-iffenv-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-15", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/311733444-farmerama-radio-farmerama-15.mp3", "size": "26423424", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

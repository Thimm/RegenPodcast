We hear from two women lawyers in Aotearoa New Zealand who tell us about how a river and a forest have been given legal personhood. Then, we hear how an economic think-tank and a London CSA have worked together to understand the community benefits of localised routes to market and local organic food. Next, we head to Cape Town to hear about food justice from two women working at a farming cooperative. Finally, we hear from an indigenous seedkeeper and leader in Turtle Island (the United States) about cultivating ancestral brilliance and regenerative economies.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 31 Jan 2021 19:13:32 +0000", "duration": "00:30:57", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-Tbd9G3rY8xtxPf6g-rCX21w-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/62-orfc-2021", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/976441537-farmerama-radio-62-orfc-2021.mp3", "size": "29728181", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

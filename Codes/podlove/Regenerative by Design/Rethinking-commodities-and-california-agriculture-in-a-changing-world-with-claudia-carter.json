These often trigger system changes that are reactionary and have short term gains. When these are practiced over the long term, they often have a degenerative effect on health and the environment.\n\nRegenerative design thinking is the opposite, and is an intentional, premeditated process that involves a high level of observation, analysis, creativity, and looking beyond reductionistic principles while embracing systems thinking and additionality to create regenerative solutions.\n\nRegenerative agriculture has become a powerful force for positive transformation and hope in todays world. And no discussion about agriculture is complete without a conversation about food.\u00a0\n\nFood is the connection between people and the planet so grab a cup of coffee or your favorite running shoes and get ready to take a mental and philosophical leap into the future of food and our planet.", "poster": "https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/29880/full_1650028082-artwork.jpg", "link": "https://snacktivistfoods.com"}, "title": "Rethinking Commodities and California agriculture in a changing world with Claudia Carter", "subtitle": "Rethinking Commodities and California agriculture in a changing world with Claudia Carter", "summary": "Our future will be defined by those who deeply understand existing, complex systems but have the ability to take that knowledge, think outside of the box, and move forward to free the system to move toward a new and better model. Few are doing this as well as Claudia Carter, Executive Director of the California What Commission. Claudia will take us on a journey from her hometown of Manta, Ecuador to her current role. We will also better understand how her passion for great food, wheat, and healthy children is changing the way we interface with one of the oldest crops on the planet and adapting to the rapidly changing California climate.", "publicationDate": "Fri, 29 Apr 2022 12:52:33 -0700", "duration": "2320", "poster": "https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/29880/full_1650028082-artwork.jpg", "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/b541ad11", "audio": [{"url": "https://media.transistor.fm/b541ad11/786e009d.mp3", "size": "56907135", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Joni Kindwall-Moore & Claudia Carter"}, {"name": "Joni Kindwall-Moore & Claudia Carter"}]}

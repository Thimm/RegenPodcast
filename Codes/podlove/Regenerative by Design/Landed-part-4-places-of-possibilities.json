And if we\u2019re to address the tangled mess of challenges we\u2019re faced with \u2013 the climate emergency, biodiversity loss, farmer burnout, food inequality and the need for reparations \u2013 then perhaps we need to be thinking not at the scale of the individual farm, but of the entire landscape.\n\nIn this final episode, Col explores the patchwork of pre- and post-colonial land relations that already exist across Scotland. He learns more about the tried and tested model of crofting that still exists in parts of the Highlands, as well as Scotland\u2019s community right-to-buy legislation, and asks whether, together, these could be part of a broader strategy to rethink land ownership and tenure, and even our relationship to land more broadly. \n\nIn the end, Col concludes that it\u2019s not the case that the family farm is no longer relevant \u2013 it\u2019s just that on its own, it\u2019s not enough to deal with what the future has in store. Instead, the family farm must come to understand itself as part of a much broader landscape \u2013 one made up of a kaleidoscope of different understandings of, and approaches to, what it means to be Landed.\n\nLanded is produced by Col Gordon and Katie Revell, with Executive Producer Abby Rose.

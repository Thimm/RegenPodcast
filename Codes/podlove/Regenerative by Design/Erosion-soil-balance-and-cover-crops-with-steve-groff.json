Steve founded Cover Crop Coaching in 2016 and has spoken to audiences across North America, Europe, Australia, Japan, and many other parts of the world on the use of cover crops across the full range of agricultural applications.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, we talk about important management tools to incorporate with cover crops, the causes of erosion in a soil system, and how farmers can supply consumer demand for nutritional value. We also discuss farm economics, the books Steve read that started him in cover cropping and a step by step guide for growers who want to start developing healthy soil.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Resources recommended by Steve</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Revolution-Bringing-Soil-Back/dp/0393608328\"> Growing a Revolution: Bringing Our Soil Back to Life by David R.

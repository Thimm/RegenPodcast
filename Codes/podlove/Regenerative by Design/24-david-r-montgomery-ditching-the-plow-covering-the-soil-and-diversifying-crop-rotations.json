All of them shared the same approach to working with the soil: ditching the plow, covering the soil and diversifying crop rotations. Meeting these farmers turned him from a pessimist into a <b>cautious optimist.</b>\u00a0<br /><br />Plus we touched upon a very interesting topic which I hope to discuss further in future interviews (and which will be the topic of a new book of David and his wife Anna). How do we grow more nutrient rich calories instead of just calories? Micro nutrient contents of food has dropped 25-50% over the past decades.Healthy food starts with healthy soil?!\u00a0<br /><br />Some tips for impact investors:</p><ul><li>Look at financing the transition, how can you partner with farmers who don\u2019t have the financial resources, make the transition to regenerative agriculture?</li><li>Look into turning around degraded land and turn it into a net asset.\u00a0</li></ul><p><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/02/17/david-r-montgomery</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />Please hit the share button if you think this interview is relevant for someone you know!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

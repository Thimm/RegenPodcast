After spending much of his career as a software CEO, Paul wanted to follow his \u201ccalling\u201d to enter the world of sustainability and foodtech.</div><div><br /></div><div>But this meant moving from a familiar career trajectory to an industry that, 10 years ago when Paul was entering it, barely even existed. In 2011, Paul founded <a href=\"https://www.brightfarms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BrightFarms</a>, which uses hydroponic greenhouses to produce locally sourced packaged salads in the US. Along the way, he has made several critical decisions for his startup\u2019s success. This includes an incredibly rare and difficult decision for any founder to make- Paul voluntarily stepped back from the role of CEO and hired someone he believed could do a better job.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, BrightFarms has 300 employees, five greenhouses, and in 2021, it was acquired by Cox Enterprises. In this episode, Paul talks about:</div><div><br /></div><ul><li>How to distinguish between what your ego is telling you and what\u2019s best for your company.</li><li>How he raised capital in the early days, as well as more recent strategic partnerships to support the growth of BrightFarms.</li><li>Why establishing core values and purpose is not simply human resources \u2018fluff\u2019, but rather integral to success throughout every phase of a startup.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>For more information on this episode, visit our <a href=\"https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/15/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-2-brightfarms\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.

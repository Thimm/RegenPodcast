The Purpose Network helps companies to stay independent and mission driven for the long term. They believe that by innovating the way companies are owned, financed and governed, companies become more successful in the long run and can benefit all of society. Steward-owned companies make a legally binding commitment to their employees and customers: that the company is not a speculative good or commodity but a group of people working for a purpose.\u00a0<br /><br />Main steward owned principles:</p><ul><li>Self governance isn\u2019t tradable, steering wheel is always hold in trust by stewards of the company</li><li>Purpose, the company has a clear purposeHow to achieve the Mission lock?</li><li>Golden Share, veto share etc.\u00a0</li></ul><p><br />Thoughts:</p><ul><li>We are working on <b>Alternative buy out capital</b></li><li>Steward ownership fosters intrinsic motivation</li><li>We are getting into time where it is important for your brand how you are owned</li><li>Normally you invest and you get power, but not in this case</li><li>Closed end fund structures is one of the reasons why we are selling companies again and again and again</li><li>So many impact investors go in and measure and make sure there is an impact, but then they go out and then what?</li><li>Ask the power question: who owns the steering wheel? Can you buy it or can you inherit it? Or do you have another principal, where ability and values decide if you can steer the company</li></ul><p><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel</a>.\u00a0<br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

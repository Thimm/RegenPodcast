You need to regenerate it. It takes time! Price and costs aren\u2019t everything. Quality vs quantity\u00a0</li><li>Long term view. If you think buying high quality food it is too expensive you can reduce your food costs by reducing animal protein.\u00a0</li></ul><p><br />Key is externalities, the more they are integrated the easier it is to compete companies with less or positive externalities (which you invested in).<br /><br />Advice to starting impact investors in regenerative agriculture:</p><ul><li>Look at emerging countries, fair trade isn\u2019t enough, look at the value chain</li><li>Investing in the good companies in Europe, help them to scale and to educate their consumers\u00a0</li></ul><p>It is too late for being just sustainable we really need to rebuild the economy regeneratively. It\u2019s a new economy we are building!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

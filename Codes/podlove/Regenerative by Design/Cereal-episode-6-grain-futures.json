If you eat bread \u2013 or any grains \u2013 you are part of it. \n\nSo how can we all get involved, and what can we do to usher in the new grains movement to build joy, nutrition and resilience in all of our communities?\n\nIn this final episode, we explore what a more efficient, nutritious, regenerative and joyful bread system might look like. We hear some of the ways people are coming together and building networks to strengthen the movement in the UK and further afield.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that in this beautifully complex, entangled system, even just a conversation can spark much wider change. This is a story of hope and a blueprint that has the potential to cause reverberations far beyond bread. It turns out that bread is political \u2013 and you, too, can take a stand for the world you want to live in. \n\nThis might be our final episode of Cereal, but it isn\u2019t the end \u2013 it\u2019s just the beginning! Join the new grains movement. Talk to your local bakers, seek out local millers, thank your farmers, be open-minded, be curious. \n\nA huge thank you to everyone who\u2019s contributed to Cereal. As well as the voices you hear in this episode, many more conversations have helped to shape the series. \n\nThanks to Andrew Whitley (Scotland the Bread), Kim Bell (Small Food Bakery and UK Grain Lab), Mark Lea (Greenacres Farm), Fred Price (Gothelney Farmer), Steven Jacobs (Organic Farmers & Growers), Ben MacKinnon (E5 Bakehouse), Anne Parry (Felin Ganol), Rupert Dunn (Torth y Tir), Josiah Meldrum (Hodmedods), Tomaso Ferrando (University of Antwerp) and Fintan Keenan.

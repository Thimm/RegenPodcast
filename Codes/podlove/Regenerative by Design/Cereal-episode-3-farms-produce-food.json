We hear how soil health, biodiversity and regenerative farming are enabling farmers to move to a new system of farming that is nutritious for humans and the land. What is the experience of farmers growing the wheat, that\u2019s ground to flour, that makes our bread? We explore why farmers are moving away from intensive chemical systems to more ecological approaches, why farmers are reclaiming their autonomy, detaching themselves from exploitative commodity markets, re-building connections with seed breeders, millers, bakers, and consumers \u2013 and once again finding reasons to celebrate diversity and distinctiveness. \n\nThe radical changes that bread has undergone are revealing of much wider truths about our relationships with food, to farmers, with the land, the environment, and with each other. If you eat food, you have a stake in this story.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 08 Dec 2019 12:00:13 +0000", "duration": "00:44:42", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000648502441-zcwxcq-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-3-farms-produce-food", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/724103950-farmerama-radio-cereal-episode-3-farms-produce-food.mp3", "size": "42992161", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

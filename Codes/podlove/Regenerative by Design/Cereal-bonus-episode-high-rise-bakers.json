High Rise Bakers were featured in episode 5 of 'Cereal' where we heard that bread is not just money, bread is nourishment, deliciousness, companionship, connectedness, pride, politics.\n\nIf you enjoy this episode then definitely listen to the full Cereal series which was released on Farmerama from mid-Nov to the end of Dec 2019.\n'Cereal' shows that the radical changes that bread has undergone are revealing of much wider truths about our relationships with food, to farmers, with the land, the environment, and with each other. If you eat food, you have a stake in this story.\n\nPlease listen, share, review and subscribe, and support the farmers and food producers instigating change. All episodes can be found on Soundcloud and all podcasting platforms.

This is one of the big drivers of industrial agriculture</li></ul><p><br />Thomas helped Luzernenhof a German CSA farm raise over 1M.-</p><ul><li>They set up their own crowdinvesting platform</li><li>Organised events made a cool video</li><li>Shares in the cooperative which owns the land</li><li>\u00a0Buy land and charge very low lease rates to the farmers</li><li>The shares give no dividends.\u00a0</li><li>Really unattractive terms</li></ul><p>Luzernenhof who has also bought land for 10 others farmers, has noticed that landowners are willing to sell for a fairer price, if they know the land is going to be used sustainably! This is a very interesting point! If regenerative farmers get a lower price for land, if this is true in other areas and countries this could be huge. <br /><br />Advice for impact investors wanting to get into Regenerative Agriculture:- Look at your local Farmland Stewardship Organisation and get involved- Look into your local CSA farms, they usually rely on bank loans you could refinance them, which would be cheaper for them and you get a return (compared to 0% on the bank)!<br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show</a><p><b>Feedback, ideas, suggestions? </b><br />- Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a> <br />- Get in touch <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a><br /><br /><b>Join our newsletter</b> on <a href=\"http://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>! <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag\">Support the show</a><br /><br /><b><em>Thanks for listening and sharing!</em></b>...</p>", "publicationDate": "Sun, 22 Apr 2018 21:08:05 +0200", "duration": "4029", "poster": "https://storage.buzzsprout.com/variants/e9q75q5bv8dudiagq7qtvau48mne/60854458c4d1acdf4e1c2f79c4137142d85d78e379bdafbd69bd34c85f5819ad.jpg", "link": "https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/04/21/thomas-rippel/", "audio": [{"url": "https://www.buzzsprout.com/1154870/4144877-33-thomas-rippel-using-a-blockchain-to-help-farmland-stewardship-organisations-grow.mp3", "size": "48370051", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Koen van Seijen"}]}

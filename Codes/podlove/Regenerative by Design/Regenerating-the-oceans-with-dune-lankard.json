These often trigger system changes that are reactionary and have short term gains. When these are practiced over the long term, they often have a degenerative effect on health and the environment.\n\nRegenerative design thinking is the opposite, and is an intentional, premeditated process that involves a high level of observation, analysis, creativity, and looking beyond reductionistic principles while embracing systems thinking and additionality to create regenerative solutions.\n\nRegenerative agriculture has become a powerful force for positive transformation and hope in todays world. And no discussion about agriculture is complete without a conversation about food.\u00a0\n\nFood is the connection between people and the planet so grab a cup of coffee or your favorite running shoes and get ready to take a mental and philosophical leap into the future of food and our planet.", "poster": "https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/29880/full_1650028082-artwork.jpg", "link": "https://snacktivistfoods.com"}, "title": "Regenerating the Oceans with Dune Lankard", "subtitle": "Regenerating the Oceans with Dune Lankard", "summary": "There is a lot of discussion about regenerative agriculture in land systems, but have you thought about what we can do to regenerate our oceans?

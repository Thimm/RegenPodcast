And about the vineyard they\u2019ve designed to allow for grazing sheep below the canopy all year round. And we learn about the roots of the Fibershed movement, again in California, ahead of the release of our upcoming mini-series Farming Fashion from Fibreshed UK.\n\nThis episode of Farmerama was made by Jo Barratt, Abby Rose and Olivia Oldham. A big thanks to the rest of the Farmerama team - Katie Revell, Annie Landless, Eliza Jenkins, Fran Bailey and Dora Taylor.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 30 Oct 2022 17:55:30 +0000", "duration": "00:26:31", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-lhMVvwxRlyTvdW3i-tgtSEA-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/1373003152-farmerama-radio-california-drought-sheep-under-vines-and-the-beginning-of-fibershed.mp3", "size": "25462072", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

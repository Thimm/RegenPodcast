That as may be, there are still a sizeable amount of growers who are firm in their conventional practices for one reason or another.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In this episode of In Search of Soil, we\u2019re talking to Dr. Gabe Kenne of the University of South Carolina to share a bit about trialing different growing practices involving tillage, no-till, and cover crops, as well as some of the nuances behind the varied soil tests we can get for our land.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Dr. Gabe Kenne is a Postdoctoral Researcher and Soil Molecular Biologist whose field of interest includes examining ways to better understand healthy soils in agricultural systems and how to subsequently promote agricultural practices that are environmentally responsible and sustainable. Currently, he is exploring nutrient cyclin potential in variously managed agricultural soils, as well as ways in which crops can be healthy and productive while minimizing synthetic inputs.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Diego introduces the episode\u2019s guest, Dr. Gabe Kenne (00:24)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Areas of regenerative agriculture that deserve more research (01:45)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Proposing research for potential solutions that affect farmers\u2019 livelihoods (04:34)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A long-held traditional agricultural view that farmers firmly hold onto (05:51)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Reasonable expectations to set when going no-till (08:14)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Where science is right now with regards to no-till (10:30)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">On individuals perceiving no-till as a risky endeavor (14:02)</span> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The cover crop project (16:05)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Project participants and their shifted views (18:48)</span></li> </ul> </li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Tremendous changes in soil in the cover crop project (20:30)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Where is the rise in soil organic matter coming from?

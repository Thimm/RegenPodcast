Roger spent most of his life as a conventional farmer in Cambridgeshire, before a series of chance events led him to Lismore \u2013 and to a radically different approach to farming. Here, Roger traces that journey, introduces us to the concept of \u201cholistic land management\u201d, and explains how he and Gilly are building a viable business on marginal land \u2013 as well as preparing the ground for the next generation of farmers.\n\nFind out more about Roger, Gilly and their work at www.lismoregrassfedbeefandlamb.co.uk. Roger recently gave a webinar titled \u201cStarting my Life\u2019s Work at 70\u201d \u2013 available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcpZ1net3f0&feature=youtu.be", "publicationDate": "Wed, 26 Aug 2020 20:11:29 +0000", "duration": "00:23:08", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-XyTdgBGhMz7r6zjE-dFgK9w-t3000x3000.png", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/882550999-farmerama-radio-lismore-roger-dixon-spain-interview-short-edit.mp3", "size": "22214784", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

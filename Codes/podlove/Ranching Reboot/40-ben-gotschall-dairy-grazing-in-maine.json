A near lifelong Dairyman, Ben's pride is obvious when he's talking about his Jersey milk cows. <br />\n<br />\nBen's passion for the future of the dairy industry is what set him on the path that has him currently in Maine, managing a dairy with 3 apprentices from the Dairy Grazing Apprenticeship program we talked about back in Episode #21 with Joe Tomandl. <br />\n<br />\nBen gets a good one in when he asks me to talk about Corrientes in the context of 'Mexican Jerseys' so make sure you catch that toward the end. <br />\n<br />\nhttps://holtcreekjerseys.com/</p>\n<p>https://www.wolfesneck.org/</p>\n<p>https://workingcows.net/ep-134-ben-gotschall-managing-market-complexity/</p>\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/GrassfedPolledA2JerseyGenetics/</p>\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/holtcreekjerseys/?hl=en</p>\n<p>https://globalagnetwork.com/ag-state-of-mind-with-jason-medows/podcast/asom-ep-17-ben-gotschall-holt-creek-jerseys</p>\n\n--- \n\nThis episode is sponsored by \n\u00b7 Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast.  <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a>\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/message\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/support</a>", "publicationDate": "Mon, 22 Nov 2021 11:00:00 GMT", "duration": "01:51:32", "poster": "https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_nologo400/12513002/12513002-1613409774517-2b6dd71aa3282.jpg", "link": "https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/40-Ben-Gotschall-Dairy-Grazing-in-Maine-e1agi41", "audio": [{"url": "https://anchor.fm/s/4b2de9e8/podcast/play/43583041/sponsor/a8el8c2/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fexports%2F4b2de9e8%2F43583041%2Ffaea98282df69b1ebe38322d8afbc877.m4a", "size": "108238090", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/x-m4a"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Red Hills Rancher"}]}

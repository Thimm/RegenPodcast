With Ray Russell and Connie Bowen", "summary": "<p>We\u2019ve talked and thought a lot about autonomy this year, and despite what we think are some promising developments, overall, we continue to be struck by just how hard it is to bring solutions to market. From the technology to the use case, from the regulations to data, there are barriers and problems to solve in every direction.</p><p>So today we\u2019re covering a ton of ground to understand why bringing autonomous solutions to agriculture is so hard. First, we talk to Connie Bowen of Farmhand Ventures, who is not particularly bullish on the near term viability of full autonomy, and has instead chosen to focus on what she calls \u201ccollaborative robotics\u201d. Then we check in with Ray Russell, Principal Hardware Engineer at Locomation on specifically why technical problems stand in the way of progress in the autonomous space. Finally, we check in briefly with Kevin Andrews, Strat Marketing Manager for Autonomy at Trimble Agriculture to understand how more established equipment players are thinking about tackling autonomy\u2019s biggest challenges. </p><p>For more information and resources, visit our <a href=\"https://feeds.backtracks.fm/feeds/tenacious/agtech-so-what/websitetenacious.ventures/notes/why-is-autonomy-in-ag-so-hard-with-ray-russell-and-connie-bowen\">website</a>.</p><p>The information in this post is not investment advice or a recommendation to invest.

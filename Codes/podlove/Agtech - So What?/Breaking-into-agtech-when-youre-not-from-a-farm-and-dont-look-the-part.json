In this episode, we meet four women who\u2019ve become agtech leaders, despite not having grown up on a farm. At the intersection of two largely white and male dominated industries (agriculture and tech), they have succeeded despite, as they say, \u2018not looking the part\u2019. You\u2019ll hear how they first got their foot in the door (from scoring discounted tickets to conferences, to setting up their own networking events, to making elevator pitches to gain on-farm experience), and what challenges they\u2019ve had to overcome to thrive. This episode is for employers looking for talent, as well as anyone looking to get into agtech and agriculture who isn\u2019t sure where to start!</div><div>On the podcast:</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayalibanerjee/?originalSubdomain=au\" target=\"_blank\">Rayali Banerjee</a> - Communications Manager, <a href=\"https://www.syngenta.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Syngenta Australia and New Zealand</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassandramao/?locale=de_DE\" target=\"_blank\">Cass Mao</a> - Program Manager, <a href=\"https://www.farmers2founders.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Farmers2Founders</a> and Venture Partner, <a href=\"https://tenacious.ventures/\" target=\"_blank\">Tenacious Ventures</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-wan/?originalSubdomain=au\" target=\"_blank\">Samantha Wan</a> - Wool Business Specialist, <a href=\"https://elders.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Elders</a></li><li><a href=\"https://foodtank.com/news/author/amy-wu/\" target=\"_blank\">Amy Wu</a> - Writer and Creator, <a href=\"https://www.farmstoincubators.com/\" target=\"_blank\">From Farms to Incubators</a></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>This is episode has been brought to you by the <a href=\"https://agthentic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AgThentic Group</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"https://futurefarmers.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Farmers Network</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>For links from the episode and to find agtech job listings, visit our <a href=\"https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</div>", "publicationDate": "Wed, 16 Dec 2020 19:01:00 +0000", "duration": "00:34:13", "poster": "https://feeds.backtracks.fm/feeds/series/a19b8b0e-6913-11ec-800c-0e4caa76571f/episodes/16962dea-6a97-11ec-a8f0-12fdf81a27ad/images/main.png?1669665040500", "link": "https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2020/12/16/breaking-into-agtech", "audio": [{"url": "https://backtracks.fm/tenacious/pr/168f3d82-6a97-11ec-a8f0-12fdf81a27ad/770647.mp3?s=1&sd=1&u=1640995775", "size": "33148852", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": null}

As a soil scientist, he has authored and co-authored more than 120 journal articles and book chapters on many subjects, most notably on clay mineralogy. Dr. Laird\u2019s research interests include carbon sequestration, chemical, mineralogical, and surface properties of soil clays, nutrient leaching, and the impact of biochar on soil quality, among many others.</p> <p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=3bc2xPYAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works\"> Dr. David Laird\u2019s Publications</a></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li>Common misconceptions around clay from an agricultural producer standpoint (02:07) <ul> <li>Clays evolve over time (04:05)</li> </ul> </li> <li>How clays affect agricultural productivity (05:42)</li> <li>Why cation exchange capacities of clay are important in agriculture (08:51) <ul> <li>Minerals: sand vs. clay (10:38)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Quartz particle size and clay particle size (14:55)</li> <li>The time it takes for a clay to dissolve like a quartz would (20:55)</li> <li>Factors affecting the evolution of clay in the Great Plains and the variation of clay and mineral contents across geographies (23:02)</li> <li>Will a plant be able to tell the difference between clays and will there be a difference in performance?

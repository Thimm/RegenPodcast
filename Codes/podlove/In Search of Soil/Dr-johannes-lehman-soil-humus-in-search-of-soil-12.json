We\u2019ll be talking about and be questioning everything that we know\u2014or <em>think</em> we know\u2014about humus, biochar, and soil organic matter with insightful, thought-provoking discussions.</p> <p>Dr. Johannes Lehmann is a professor at Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences with a profound interest in advancing studies on biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrient elements in soil. Apart from pioneering studies on biochar in the 90\u2019s, his current field of research is locally and globally relevant, impacting both climate change and environmental pollution.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li>Introduction to today\u2019s guest, Johannes Lehmann (00:46)</li> <li>Johannes Lehmann on our general understanding of organic matter in soil (01:55)</li> <li>The key unknown to hasten our progress to understand soil (06:00) <ul> <li>Finer points that are unknown, mainly the intricate interactions between microorganisms (08:12)</li> </ul> </li> <li>The theory of humus and why it made sense (10:20)</li> <li>Humus, as we understand it, does not exist (17:34)</li> <li>The initial thought behind the formation of humus (19:38)</li> <li>In situ: microorganisms, soil, and carbon (20:53)</li> <li>An analogy of functional complexity (25:40)</li> <li>The question of the evolution of soil microorganisms (29:15)</li> <li>Is the lack of microorganismal evolution nature protecting itself?

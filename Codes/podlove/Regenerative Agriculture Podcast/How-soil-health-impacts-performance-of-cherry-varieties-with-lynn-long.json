At that time, the main cherry variety being grown was Bing on a Mazzard rootstock, leading to disease and susceptibility to weather pressure. Lynn has been an advocate for diversity in varieties and rootstocks, maintaining a cherry variety trial since 1996, and evaluating nearly 100 varieties and selections for potential adoption by the sweet cherry industry in the Pacific Northwest. He has been instrumental in progressing the use of dwarfing rootstocks and new training systems in commercial orchards. Long has authored many publications and has spoken in grower oriented meetings in 16 countries around the world.\u00a0 <p>In this episode, Lynn and I discuss the future of sweet cherry production. Lynn believes the future development of tree fruit will emerge when we begin better managing \u2018the other half of the tree' - the root system. \u00a0</p> </div> <ul> <li>How\u00a0soil health and compost applications contribute\u00a0to varietal performance</li> <li>How modern dwarf rootstocks compare to older varieties</li> <li>What is the future of biological and mechanical solutions to automate harvesting</li> <li>Successfully reducing bacterial canker with plant nutrition</li> <li>...And more!\u00a0</li> </ul> <div>Very thought provoking for any tree fruit grower!</div> <div>\u00a0</div> <div>\u00a0</div> <div>\u00a0</div> <div> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cherries-Botany-Production-Jos%C3%A9-Quero-Garcia/dp/1780648375\"> Cherries: Botany, Production and Uses</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://extension.oregonstate.edu/people/lynn-long\">https://extension.oregonstate.edu/people/lynn-long</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Episode 12 - Lynn Long - Highlights</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2:45 - What are some memorable moments that have lead Lynn to where he is today?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 90\u2019s, cherry production was focused on one single variety. There wasn\u2019t a lot of diversity at the time.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1994, Lynn went to Europe and gained knowledge that changed the way cherries are farmed in the US</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:10 -

How does the vigor of modern dwarf rootstock compared to older varieties?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of farmers prefer older varieties</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwarfing rootstock seen to be more shallow</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9:10 - What has been missing in looking at the \u201cother half of the tree\u201d</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything from research to management has been focused on only half the tree - the top half.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are seeing more and more research being done on what is happening below ground with the tree</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11:20 - What are some of the things Lynn has observed to cause him to start to wonder what is happening in the soil profile?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwarfing rootstock in hard soil affecting the growth and behavior of trees</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leaves look stressed and wilted, impacting food quality</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping microorganisms alive throughout the entire year to affect the health of the ecosystem and the tree</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14:20 -

In this episode, we discuss Robert's project with the USDA decomposing weed seeds in soil, native soil microorganisms and microbial interactions, and the implications of AMPA and glyphosate on soil biology. We also discuss Robert's thoughts on the challenge of manganese availability, how growing GMO's impacts soil health, building soil carbon, how to choose soil inoculants and many more fascinating insights from a highly respected soil scientist.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Episode 1 - Dr. Kremer - Highlights</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">0:03:00 - What are Robert\u2019s memorable moments leading up to where he is today?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Robert was asked by the USDA Agricultural Research Service to look at the possibility of decomposing weed seeds in soil used in microbiological approaches.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Robert saw in the 80\u2019s, weed and pest management was mainly chemical based.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Through trying natural ways of controlling weeds and attempting to understand what pesticides do, which lead him soil quality/health.</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0:05:50 - Has Robert had success in developing biological controls?

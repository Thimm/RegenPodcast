On the mini-episode this week, I talk about which nutrients drive strong vegetative growth, and which drive strong reproductive growth and development, along with the hormonal interactions which drive plant dominance. Nutrients in both categories interact with and synergize or antagonize certain plant hormones. These interactions shape how trees and plants develop reproductive buds and fruitwood versus shoot growth. On this episode, I talk about which nutrients are vegetative, which are reproductive, and how to switch plant dominance between vegetative and reproductive stages.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 Vegetative Growth nutrients:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nitrate Nitrogen (not ammonium or urea)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potassium</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chloride</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calcium</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reproductive nutrients:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All other nutrients will bring a slight reproductive response but the below 3 drive the strongest reproductive growth.</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manganese</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phosphorus</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ammonium</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Feedback & Booking</strong></p> <p>Please send your feedback, requests for topics or guests, or booking request have a Podcast episode recorded LIVE at your event -- to <a href=\"mailto:production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com\">production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com</a>.

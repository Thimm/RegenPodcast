Schwartz for the introduction to Zach!\u00a0<br /><br />Take aways from the interview:</p><ul><li>Climate change is a symptom of the severe water cycle disturbance and there is something we can do about it!\u00a0</li><li>When the landscape isn\u2019t being recharged with water, it leads to flooding and drought (worst case also fire)</li><li>Humans desertified 1/3 of the earth\u2019s cover the last 10.000 years</li><li>We are carbon based life but the living part is mostly water</li><li>There is much more you (as a land owner/manager) to influence the water cycle on and above your land- Often when we talk about water we talk about big centralised water systems or the weather, Zach is focussed on decentralised water retention landscapes- Sub-irrigated, you use a lot less energy</li><li>Climate changes: everywhere the same story the precipitation is more when it comes and it comes less often</li><li>Large dams and reservoirs are very energy intensive, smaller decentralised water retention systems are much more efficient</li><li>Flood fire and drought mitigation is a sector Zach is very interested in</li><li>Zach is building a platform to franchise his model, to pilot this in 2020</li><li>Huge opportunity for video visual content, what have we done during the last 10.000 years, and our role and our options</li><li>Could be something we all can get behind, water retention.\u00a0</li><li>We can\u2019t address climate change without addressing the water cycle disturbance</li><li>Zach tries to use most of the time with costumers on the implementation not on the consultation</li></ul><p><br />Advice for investors from Zach (not investment advice):<em> Rewriting natural resource policy management, very often what Zach wants to do is illegal. </em><br /><br />All show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/02/03/zach-weiss</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

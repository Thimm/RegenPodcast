Over the last 7 years they have invested over 250M in 18 properties across Canada and recently made their first regenerative sustainable deal. <br /><br />Farmers get 100 percent of the income and appreciation from their portion of the joint venture, plus 15 percent of the income and appreciation from the portion owned by Area One Farms. In addition to the land, Area One Farms will also share in the cost of equipment and grain storage. Each deal is designed around the needs of the particular farm operation. No rent or other expenses are charged by Area One.<br /><br />Show notes and links here:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/11/11/joelle-faulkner</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

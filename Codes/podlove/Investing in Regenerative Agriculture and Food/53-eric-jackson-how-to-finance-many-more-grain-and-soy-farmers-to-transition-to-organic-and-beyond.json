One of those banks is Rabobank who designed a transition finance product specific for farmers to transition to organic</li><li>Pipeline Food provides the long term off take agreements to these farmers</li><li>Some NGOs/institutions are potentially interested to come alongside the banks and de-risk some of these loans or this money can be pooled and bring down the interest rates for farmers</li><li>It is relatively easy to have the discussion today as the conventional agriculture is suffering of low returns</li><li>There is a Regenerative Organic Label, with the USDA organic as a base</li><li>The movement against pesticides and herbicides is getting stronger</li><li>One of the great myths is that organic needs to be more expensive. Maybe in the short term but the longer term probably not.</li><li>We are what we eat, including the environment.</li></ul><p><br />If Eric could change one thing overnight he would get away with glysofate and certain classes of herbicides.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/06/25/eric-jackson-2</a>.\u00a0<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

What a year it has been. Just when you thought things couldn\u2019t get any crazier we find ourselves in a war in Europe, crazy energy and food prices and extreme high inflation rates in general. <br /><br />In an ideal world farms applying regenerative practises are more resilient, but as we saw with the story of <a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/11/01/josh-heyneke/\">Josh Heyneke, founder of Parc Carreg, </a>farms can get into trouble very quickly when input prices spike (in this case organic grain from Ukraine to feed the ducks). It seems like Josh and his partner Abigail will make it through the winter and are building hard on their more resilient future, which will include climate neutral eggs!</p><p><b>The most important story</b></p><p>Healthy soil equals healthy food equals healthy people is arguably the most important story we shared in 2022. We kicked off this new <a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/nutrient-density-in-food-series/\">Nutrient Density in Food series</a> unpacking this crucial piece of the puzzle (supported by the <a href=\"http://www.ateamfoundation.org/\">A Team Foundation</a> who is looking to make investments and donations in the space).</p><p>We interviewed Anne Bikl\u00e9 and David R Montgomery who not only co authored the <a href=\"https://peerj.com/articles/12848/\">study \u201cSoil health and nutrient density: preliminary comparison of regenerative and conventional farming\u201d</a>, but also wrote the book <a href=\"https://www.dig2grow.com/books\">What your food ate</a>. if you haven\u2019t read it please do it asap and give it to anyone interested in health!\u00a0</p><p>Interviews with <a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/11/15/fred-provenza/\">Fred Provenza</a> and <a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/11/08/zuzanna-zielinska/\">Zuzanna Zieli\u0144ska</a> really showed how strong this connection is. We look forward to continue this series in 2023.<br />REQUEST: If you have people we should interview that are building companies in the food- from healthy soils- as medicine space, please let us know!</p><p><b>Farmers\u2019 Philosophy Series and Video!\u00a0</b></p><p>There is so much more we can learn from the key decision makers of our time, farmers than soil health and this deserves time and space. Following the legends in the podcasting world, we couldn\u2019t stay behind :) and in November we recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx7Cvv5aqw8\">our first video interview</a>.</p><p>Together with <a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/12/05/farmers-philosophy-klompe/\">regenerative farmer and pioneer Jeroen Klompe</a> we sat down and took time to go deep. We covered a lot of ground while really enjoying the process. Let us know in the comments what you think!\u00a0</p><p><b>Going deeper</b></p><p>The video episode wasn\u2019t the only place where we went deeper. Non other than <a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2022/05/31/charles-eisenstein/\">Charles Eisenstein</a> joined us for a deep conversation!

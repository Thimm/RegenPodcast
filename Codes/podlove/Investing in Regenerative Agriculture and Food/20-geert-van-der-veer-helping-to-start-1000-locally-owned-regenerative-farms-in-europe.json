Producing about 60% of the daily food for the families at prices lower than a supermarket. Now Geert is working to help other local communities to do the same, and in doing so helping start 1000 locally owned regenerative farms all over Europe.\u00a0<br /><br />Local Energy: They always start with local energy, if you want a local Herenboeren farm near you, you need to put in part of the work to gather the local community. Herenboeren will help you with the set up, finding/buying the land, finding the farmer and help run it. But they can\u2019t bring the local energy together to form the strong local community needed to support a thriving Herenboeren farm.\u00a0<br /><br />Challenges: It proofs really difficult to find farmers who can farm regeneratively at scale:\u201c We have one challenge because our farmers are always specialised in producing one product, and on our farm they have to do about everything that exists in that way\u201d\u00a0<br /><br />We also talked about the role of impact investors in this local revolution.\u00a0<br /><br />Geert sees two options:</p><ul><li>helping local communities acquire land for a Herenboeren farm</li><li>helping Herenboeren (a service organisation which services the Herenboeren in their day to day operation) scale up</li></ul><p><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/10/20/geert-van-der-veer</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />Please hit the share button if you think this interview is relevant for someone you know!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

Her new book, \u2018Dancing With Bees\u2019, is a love letter to the natural world. It brings the world of pollinators alive, and makes it overwhelmingly obvious that, once again, we humans have gravely oversimplified nature by allowing our desire for honey to blind us to the complex life of bees. In \u2018Dancing with Bees\u2019, Brigit awakens us to a new world where we are reminded that diversity is key, and inspires us all to get in action where the first step is just to start noticing our pollinator friends. Thanks to Chelsea Green Publishing for supporting this episode.", "publicationDate": "Thu, 05 Sep 2019 18:12:12 +0000", "duration": "00:30:16", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000593355882-r3xnos-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/676316609-farmerama-radio-brigit-strawbridge-howard-dancing-with-bees.mp3", "size": "29130963", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

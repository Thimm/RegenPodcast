As Fiona shares about beauty, land, rewilding and much more, we hear from Welsh upland sheep farmer Rees Roberts and spiritual ecologist & artist Nessie Reid with what they think about these issues and ideas. \nBeauty may seem a little airy-fairy and disconnected from the realities of running a farming business. But please do hear us out to the end\u2026this is about bringing power back to the people.\nFiona\u2019s recent book The Fight for Beauty is a call to arms for all of us to pay more attention to matters of the earth and oceans. We caught up with Fiona and she told us how she sees farming fits into the future of a Britain built on beauty.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 28 May 2017 08:02:23 +0000", "duration": "00:32:11", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000224537674-e1t5ia-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/22-farmerama", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/324678344-farmerama-radio-22-farmerama.mp3", "size": "46283968", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

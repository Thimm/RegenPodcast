After a decade away, he\u2019s finally returned to the place that he loves: his family farm. Now, he\u2019s eager to start realising his vision for an agroecological future: a future in which rural areas are alive with culture, many more people work on the land, farms operate in sympathy with nature, and nutritious food is available to everyone in society.\n\nBut now that he\u2019s back, Col\u2019s starting to wonder whether this vision can be achieved within the existing family farm model. Increasingly, it seems the odds are stacked against farms like his. Many are struggling to survive, let alone to employ people and deliver good food affordably to local communities. As older farmers retire without succession plans, and their land is amalgamated into large industrial operations, the future of the small family farm looks pretty bleak.\n\nAs he wrangles with all of this, Col stumbles across something that throws his vision \u2013 and his very understanding of farming \u2013 into doubt. What does it mean to say that \u201cThe family farm is a colonial concept\u201d? And might this jarring idea be the key to understanding the problem \u2013 as well as its potential solutions?\n\nLanded is produced by Col Gordon and Katie Revell, with Executive Producer Abby Rose.

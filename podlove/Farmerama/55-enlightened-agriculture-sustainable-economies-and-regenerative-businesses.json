So we wanted to take a moment to say as ever we and so many others are grateful for all the work you do: thank you - Farmerama is made for you! \n\nThis month, we go back to the Oxford Real Farming Conference (ORFC) one last time, this time to focus on the economic system and ask the question: what form does our economy need to take if we want to support a regenerative farming future? To start helping us answer this question, we hear from biologist, author and co-founder of the ORFC Colin Tudge, who helps us understand today\u2019s dominant economic paradigm, and shares his vision for an economy that supports regenerative farming.\n\nNext, we speak to Tony Greenham, a finance professional, economist, sustainability consultant and Executive Director at South West Mutual, who explains how, in his view, the economy has failed us and what he thinks a more sustainable economy might look like. We share some of the final episode of CEREAL, the 6-part series we released at the end of last year, to illustrate how everything Colin and Tony spoke about is embedded in our food systems, including in our bread.\n\nTwo of the key characters in CEREAL were baker and regenerative retailer at Small Food Bakery, Kimberly Bell, and Fred Price, farmer at Gothelney Farm. They both run regenerative businesses that produce food to nourish people, bring joy, promote healthy lifestyles and build communities. We hear from them about what shifting towards regenerative business and a regenerative economy means to them. \n\nThis episode of Farmerama was made by Abby Rose, Louis Hudson and Hanna Soderlund.

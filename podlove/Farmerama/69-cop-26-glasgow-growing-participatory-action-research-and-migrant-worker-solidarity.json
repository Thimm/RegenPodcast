We\u2019ll highlight Nourish Scotland\u2019s involvement at the conference, and speak to Warami Jackson and Marlon Opigo, two participants in Feedback\u2019s \u201cparticipatory action research\u201d- an innovative and inclusive project researching young people\u2019s experience of the food system. We\u2019ll visit the Landworkers\u2019 Alliance\u2019s agroecology hub, and speak to the LWA\u2019s Catherine McAndrew about the urgent call for solidarity with migrant workers.\nThis episode of Farmerama was produced by Katie Revell, Olivia Oldham and Abby Rose.\n\nWe\u2019re very grateful to those of you that support us and allow us to bring you these stories every month.

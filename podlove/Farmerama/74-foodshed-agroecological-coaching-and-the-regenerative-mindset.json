Firstly we hear from Bea Alvarez, Climate Resilience Projects & Outreach Coordinator at Carbon Sink Farms and Foodshed in San Diego County, California abouut how collaborations between multiple farmers and indigenous landholders have built a new vision for the food and farming system there. Clare Hill at FAI Farms tells us about her journey, moving towards a regenerative farming system and we hear from Nicole Masters about the CREATE program and what it takes to train people so they can coach others on a regenerative journey.\n\nWe\u2019re very grateful to those of you that support us and allow us to bring you these stories every month. Even the smallest contribution makes a big difference to us.

They do so through massive experiments using low cost soil moisture sensors and online courses. GROW also uses people\u2019s observations of soils to improve environmental monitoring by satellites. In so doing, the project helps with climate change adaptation.\n\nIn this spcial feature, Nikos Vrantsis speaks to Greek organic olive grower Pavlos Georgiadis, one of the initiators of the GROW Observatory, from one of the first GROW Places - Pavlos' own olive farm in Alexandroupoli. He explains how the project is able to provide benefit to growers, people passionate about soil and communities who will take part in the project. He also has some interesting things to say in support of the democratisation of knowledge for Soil Stewardship.\n\nwww.growobservatory.org", "publicationDate": "Wed, 02 May 2018 15:23:50 +0000", "duration": "00:19:41", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000343289391-9ypmio-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-grow-observatory", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/438318414-farmerama-radio-shorts-grow-observatory.mp3", "size": "18965360", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

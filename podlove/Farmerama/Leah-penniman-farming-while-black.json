Her book, \u2018Farming While Black\u2019, published by Chelsea Green Publishing, is a multi-layered journey with practical tips for beginner farmers, afro-indigenous recipes, leadership advice, the story of building a farm and serving a community. But at its heart, this is a call to action, empowering people of colour to reclaim traditions and cultures that have been suppressed by colonialism and slavery. Thanks to Chelsea Green Publishing for supporting this episode.

The quality of a loaf starts with the wheat. Most bread we eat today is made using modern varieties of wheat that were bred for yield at the expense of everything else. These seeds produce a monoculture of plants that can yield a lot in a good year, but are reliant on chemical inputs and extremely vulnerable in the face of climatic extremes. Most shockingly international legislation dictates that trading any wheat seeds that don\u2019t fit the modern wheat breeding criteria is essentially illegal. \n\nWe hear from a top scientist about new findings showing we need to dramatically rethink the seeds we sow if we want to feed the planet in years to come, re-focusing on diversity and quality. \n\nAnd there\u2019s real hope \u2013 stories of people all over the UK who are finding ways around these oppressive laws, building up a seedbank that supports diversity, low-input ecological farming and nutritious grains to feed people.\n\nThis is just the beginning. The radical changes that bread has undergone are revealing of wider truths about our relationships with food, to farmers, with the land, the environment, and with each other.\n\nThis if the second episode in a 6 part series, Cereal, uncovering the hidden truths behind our bread and the people who are building a new grains movement.\nCereal is written and produced by Katie Revell and made possible by the generous support of the Roddick Foundation.\n\nFeatured in this episode:\nAndrew Whitley, Bread Matters, Chairman of Scotland the Bread, currently based at Bowhouse Fife\nRupert Dunn, Torth y Tir, community supported peasant bakery, Wales\nJohn Letts, Heritage Harvest\nMartin Wolfe, Wakelyn\u2019s Agroforestry (previously Professor of Plant Pathology at Cambridge)\nMark Lea, Green Acres Farm, Shropshire\nKimberley Bell, Small Food Bakery, Nottingham\nJosiah Meldrum, Hodmedods", "publicationDate": "Sun, 01 Dec 2019 12:19:45 +0000", "duration": "00:39:12", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000645358915-cce4t6-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/720818533-farmerama-radio-cereal-episode-2-nature-hates-uniformity.mp3", "size": "56515858", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

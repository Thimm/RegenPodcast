It's interesting to get a clear image of what his tree layout looks like, and what this means in term on infrastructure and management. He has tested planting perennial crops in the tree understory, a tempting idea that encounters some practical and commercial limitations. We cover some issues such as if we should be worried of weeds growing in the tree line or if root and light competition are a challenge for him. We then explore another interesting aspect of his farm : how he uses woodchips to fulfil 100% of his fertility needs and how much of his land he would need to dedicate to tree cover if he were to produce all his inputs onsite. As a little bonus, we indulge in a little off topic but fascinating conversation on organic matter.</p><p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p>00:02.22 Overview of the farm</p><p>00:07:31 Why agroforestry</p><p>00:11:43 Which trees did he chose?&nbsp;</p><p>00:13:40 Funding &amp; cost</p><p>00:16:06 Layout and spacings of trees</p><p>00:21:08 Experimenting with understory planting</p><p>00:26:20 Impact of trees on vegetable production</p><p>00:33:04 Time for managing the trees</p><p>00:37:55 Are weeds in the tree line a problem?&nbsp;</p><p>00:44:52 Is it worth planting the understory?&nbsp;</p><p>00:49:40 Composting woodchips</p><p>00:54:50 Applying rameal chipped wood on soil surface</p><p>01:01:29 Are wood chips economically interesting as an input?&nbsp;</p><p>01:05:22 How much tree cover to be autonomous in inputs?&nbsp;</p><p>01:07:05 Effects of excess of organic matter</p><p>01:19:00 Compost recipe and which trees species to favour as input?&nbsp;</p><p>01:22:52 Machinery to woodchip and compost</p><p>01:25:53 Advice for vegetable grower wishing to integrate trees&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u2022 RESOURCES</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.tolhurstorganic.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tolhurstorganic.co.uk/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.agforward.eu/index.php/en/silvoarable-agroforestry-in-the-uk.html?file=files/agforward/documents/leaflets/35_Managing_the_tree_understorey_for_food_and_biodiversity.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Managing_the_tree_understorey_for_food_and_biodiversity.pdf</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 GET IN TOUCH&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.regenerativeagroforestry.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.regenerativeagroforestry.org</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 SUPPORT US</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gumroad.com/regenagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.gumroad.com/regenagroforestry</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 FOLLOW US</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Regagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RegenerativeAgroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/regenerativeagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/regenerativeagroforestry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><br /><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

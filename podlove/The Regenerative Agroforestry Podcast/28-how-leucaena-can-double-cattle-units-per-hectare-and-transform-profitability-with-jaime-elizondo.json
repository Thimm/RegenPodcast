Beyond improving his grass productivity and providing fodder for his cows, Jaime is planting trees for a multitude of benefits such as biodiversity, cattle wellbeing and soil regeneration. </p><p>In this interview Jaime is talking directly to farmers and graziers with a wealth of practical information as we break down key topics in his pollarding system. He discusses how he establishes the trees, rotates the animals around them, how he pollards and how cattle digest strong chemical compounds produced by trees. </p><p>We hope you enjoy!</p><p><strong>\u2022 TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p>02:00 - Introduction</p><p>09:20 - Why started planting trees</p><p>15:20 - Why leucaena?</p><p>18:30 - Tree density and cattle stocking rate</p><p>20:50 - How to direct seed leucaena</p><p>30:25 - Competition between trees and grass</p><p>34:00 - Adapted animal genetics for silvopasture</p><p>38:00 - Leucaena rate of inclusion in cattle feed intake</p><p>39:40 - Pollarding vs direct browsing of leucaena</p><p>44:05 - Fencing and protecting trees</p><p>48:30 - Tree - grass interactions and tree densities</p><p>53:10 - Silvopasture and non-selective grazing rotations</p><p><strong>\u2022 RESOURCES</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rwranching.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rwranching.com/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RealWealthRanching\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/RealWealthRanching</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/realwealthranching/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.instagram.com/realwealthranching/?hl=en</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 GET IN TOUCH&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.regenerativeagroforestry.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.regenerativeagroforestry.org</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 SUPPORT US</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gumroad.com/regenagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.gumroad.com/regenagroforestry</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 FOLLOW US</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RegenerativeAgroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/regenerativeagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/regenerativeagroforestry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><br /><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Now, there are a ton of practices and amendments available that supposedly make our soils healthier, from compost to compost teas, to biochar, to a lot of other things.</p> <p>Consequently, one such amendment that\u2019s coming more and more into light these past few years is live microbial amendments. Microbial amendments help both stimulate and improve the microbial fauna in the soil that keep our crops healthy. And we have Dr. Paul Zorner of Locus Ag to talk about how microbial amendments do just that.</p> <p>Dr. Paul Zorner is an Adjunct Professor at the Department of Horticulture at North Carolina State University, as well as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Agronomist of Locus Agricultural Solutions, an agricultural company that produces microbial probiotics. Firmly believing that agriculture is one of the most sustainable ways to mitigate our current climate issues, he is also one of the key proponents to actively push for incentivizing farmers to sequester carbon in the soil to improve the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://locusag.com/\">https://locusag.com/</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li>Diego introduces the episode\u2019s guest, Dr. Paul Zorner (00:58)</li> <li>Is our view of soil and the complex relationships within it too reductionist?

His work in probiotics resulted in global engagements in many fields including microbiology, agriculture, and human health. In 2004, he founded SCD Probiotics where they develop and commercialize consortia fermentation technologies for multiple industries.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">More on microbes at SCD Probiotics: <a href=\"https://www.scdprobiotics.com/\">https://www.scdprobiotics.com/</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Dr. Matthew Wood\u2019s interest in the soil sciences (01:40)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Studying in Japan and working with Dr. Teruo Higa (03:24)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Notable findings working with Dr. Teruo Higa (04:43)</span> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">An increase in the diversity index (05:05)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Plant-microbe communication (06:53)</span></li> </ul> </li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What is EM?

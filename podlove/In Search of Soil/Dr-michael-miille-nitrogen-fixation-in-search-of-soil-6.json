The search has been going on for 50 years with no luck.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">And this is where synthetic biology comes in. Synthetic biology strives to engineer beneficial microbes to give growers the same, or better, optimized solutions that traits and chemicals do.\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">So if we can\u2019t find a naturally occurring nitrogen-fixing bacteria to associate with non-legumes, why not engineer one? In this episode, we\u2019re joined by Dr. Michael Miille, the CEO of Joyn Bio to tell us a little bit about the sci-fi-esque venture of engineering bacteria.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">More on Joyn Bio: https://joynbio.com/</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">What Joyn Bio is setting out to do (02:15)</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">How difficult or doable is Joyn Bio\u2019s core mission?

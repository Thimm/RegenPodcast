For more than three decades, Dr. Beck has been creating comprehensive systems for both irrigated and dryland crop production throughout the region, educating growers on the power of crop rotation, diversity, and other regenerative practices. He currently serves as the Research Manager at the Dakota Lakes Research Farm, a non-profit made up of farmers committed to sustainable land practices.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On today\u2019s episode, John and Dwayne discuss:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne\u2019s background and his earlier work assisting local growers with their irrigation systems</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The continuing decline of the Ogallala Aquifer and how water infiltration can be improved by implementing no-till agricultural practices.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addressing the often-overlooked aspects of irrigation, such as percolation and water delivery, and how it affects soil health.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne\u2019s observations on lake bottom soils, the power of macropores, and the prevalence of summer fallowing in the High Plains.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilizing de-percolation strategies to maintain proper nutrient levels in your soil.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using competition, sanitation, and rotation to control weeds, diseases and insects.\u00a0</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne\u2019s historical research on nutrient cycling and fertilizer placement.\u00a0</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dwayne offers up a broader historical perspective on how agriculture, human nature, and mother nature\u00a0 work together.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A discussion on why moving to no-till options for all crops including potatoes, carrots and sugar beets are engineering and genetics problems.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shared vision, but much different methods, between regenerative agriculture vs. organic agriculture.</li> </ul>", "publicationDate": "Tue, 03 Nov 2020 20:51:07 +0000", "duration": "01:15:32", "poster": "https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/d/1/6/2/d1629a78885f4c0b/RegenerativeAgricultureShow-Show-main.png", "link": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3", "audio": [{"url": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Dwayne_Beck_Final_Audio.mp3?dest-id=698390", "size": "108751017", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": null}

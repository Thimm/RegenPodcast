John and David discuss soil regeneration at length, pulling from David\u2019s experience developing new topsoil in dead, stony ground and his deep dive into the science behind it.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David came to the field of regenerative agriculture from a unique position. As a geologist studying erosion, he became curious about agricultural impacts on soils. \u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When David set out to write his first book, Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations, he imagined it would tie the subject of landscape formation over millennia to how soil erosion affected ancient civilizations. He ended up writing about the history of farming, because that's where soil erosion and degradation connects back to human societies. Spending more than a decade looking at how agriculture has influenced soil loss resulted in an epiphany that led him to see regenerative agriculture as the solution to historically degenerative agricultural problems.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this thought-provoking interview, John and David discuss:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How conventional farming practices have contributed to mining the soil, and how this impacts the future of global societies.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David\u2019s observations of rebuilding soil at scale and the science behind it</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3 principles of successful soil regeneration:</span></li> <li> <ol> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimal ground disturbance</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep the surface covered</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grow diverse crop rotations</span></li> </ol> </li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How the key to rapid restoration of soil fertility is about kick-starting the biology</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why David is an unrepentant optimist on the issue of reversing soil degradation, something he didn\u2019t think would happen when he wrote the book on erosion.</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John and David explore the soil-life effects of glyphosate as an antibiotic and mineral chelator, and conjecture as to it\u2019s human health impacts. There is a fascinating glimpse of a South African farm that doubles as a cheetah rehabilitation area, that may spur new ideas on meshing agriculture with wildlife conservation. David shares about his two musical projects as well.</span> <a href=\"https://www.bandmix.com/bigdirt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.bandmix.com/bigdirt/</span></a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David is the author of two books:</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery/dp/0520272900/ref=pd_sim_b2b_3/133-5337627-0547934?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0520272900&amp;pd_rd_r=1df98c51-6d9c-11e9-8569-854b1f91686d&amp;pd_rd_w=YCG95&amp;pd_rd_wg=zllq3&amp;pf_rd_p=a07701e4-f565-442a-b97f-93ab23cbb7ef&amp;pf_rd_r=0YD58ZZT5CTZTVMJYFVQ&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=0YD58ZZT5CTZTVMJYFVQ\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a02007</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Revolution-Bringing-Soil-Back/dp/0393356094/ref=sxbs_sxwds-stvp?crid=19H3YIX4ZTUSM&amp;keywords=dirt+to+soil+by+gabe+brown&amp;pd_rd_i=0393356094&amp;pd_rd_r=d71e1350-50c9-4520-8c39-9d90c02fdc5a&amp;pd_rd_w=SUYP6&amp;pd_rd_wg=gZMAe&amp;pf_rd_p=a6d018ad-f20b-46c9-8920-433972c7d9b7&amp;pf_rd_r=VK472XD968Y7XXNE79VS&amp;qid=1556885252&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=dirt+to+soil,aps,134\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing a Revolution: Bringing Our Soil Back to Life</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a02017.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David\u2019s recommended reading list from the episode:</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Soil-Familys-Regenerative-Agriculture/dp/1603587632/ref=sr_1_1?crid=19H3YIX4ZTUSM&amp;keywords=dirt+to+soil+by+gabe+brown&amp;qid=1556885219&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=dirt+to+soil,aps,134&amp;sr=8-1\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dirt to Soil by Gabe Brown</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Organic-No-Till-Farming-Advancing-Agriculture/dp/1601730179/ref=sr_1_fkmrnull_1?keywords=organic+no+till+jeff+moyer&amp;qid=1556885386&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1-fkmrnull\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic No-Till Farming by Jeff Moyer</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Third-Plate-Field-Notes-Future/dp/1594204071/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1FHILG089XOCC&amp;keywords=the+third+plate+dan+barber&amp;qid=1556885450&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+third+plate,stripbooks,132&amp;sr=1-1\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Third Plate by Dan Barber</span></a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The Community Impact Partner</strong> for this episode is Jerry Hatfield, director of the National Lab for Agriculture and the Environment at the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service.

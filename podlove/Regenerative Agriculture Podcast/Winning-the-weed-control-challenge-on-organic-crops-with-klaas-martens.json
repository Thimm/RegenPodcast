Klaas has been farming for more than 30 years and has driven the adoption of sustainable farming practices through his work with numerous national organizations and advisory committees. This episode contains some really great information from Klaas\u2019s many years of experience developing sustainable farming systems.</p> <p>In this episode, we talk about the cultural practices that form the basis of weed control, how Klaas thought he had discovered a pathogen that could become a new herbicide, and what it turned out to be, how to see and monitor field variables, crop rotations, and how Klaas has managed the weed control on his farm in upstate New York for the past 30 years.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Episode 8 - Klaas Martens - Highlights</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2:50 - Going from conventional farming to completely organic</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3:40 - Having to unlearn some things from a university education</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:20 - Klaas was noticing that his observations in farming were contradicting his learned models and assumptions</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5:15 - What have been the memorable moments that have lead Klaas to where he is today?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning that cultural practices form the basis of all weed control - chemicals are auxiliary only</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural practices are everything you do in the tending of your fields - what you do to set up the situation the crop is growing in</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens if you abandon a field?

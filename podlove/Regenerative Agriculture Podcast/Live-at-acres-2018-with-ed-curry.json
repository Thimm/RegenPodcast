This is why we chose Acres 2018 for our first ever Podcast LIVE and why John and Ed make such a great pair to co-create this inaugural episode at this event.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">Ed is an old-school breeder and grower with a new-school mentality. More than 90% of the green chiles grown in the US and Mexico are from Ed\u2019s breeding program. He is now the only breeder of his kind in the world.</p> <p>Even if you don\u2019t grow chiles, you can certainly learn something from this discussion.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The show covers important topics such as:</p> <ul> <li>The art of visual phenotyping</li> <li>Soil health\u2019s impact on genetics</li> <li>Increase in yield by maximizing genetic potential over time</li> <li>Visually measuring the yield and quality of a chile crop within 30 days of planting</li> <li>The relationship between early vigor and crop yield</li> <li>How Ed\u2019s management practices have brought steady decreases in Phytophthora and Xanthomonas bacterial spot</li> <li>Ed\u2019s prediction for the coming capsaicin revolution and its many positive benefits</li> </ul> <p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most powerful things Ed says is, \u201cThe soul of farming is the soil.\u201d We agree.</p> <p>The finale of our first season, episode #30, represents a huge milestone and our first ever Podcast LIVE.

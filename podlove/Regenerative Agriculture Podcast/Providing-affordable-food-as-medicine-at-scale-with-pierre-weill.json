He then went on to co-found a nonprofit association called Bleu-Blanc-C\u0153ur, which connects all the actors involved in the food chain to help producers and consumers connect the dots between reduction in disease and the quality of food production.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pierre\u2019s fascinating research trials examine the differences in human health when animal products from animals fed high-quality forage-based diets are consumed versus products from conventionally fed animals. In one group of six trials, conventionally fed animals were fed a diet of corn and soybeans, and the animals with a healthy diet were fed high-quality forages and seeds. Consumers in the trials were divided into control groups who ate milk, eggs, and other animal products from the conventionally fed animals, and experimental groups that ate the same from animals which were fed the higher-quality products.\u00a0</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two groups ate the same quantity and type of foods. The only difference was the diet of the animals. In this way, the producer\u2019s behavior, and not the consumer\u2019s behavior, was measured.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a proof of concept, the omega 6 and omega 3 levels, which correlate with the inflammatory processes, were measured in both groups of people, and a significant difference was found. The ratio of omega 6 and omega 3, which is healthy at a level of 5 and pro-inflammatory at a level of 10, was 15 in the control groups, and five in the experimental groups.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pierre also talks about the structure of a new trial, currently underway, testing the immunity of breastfed children with the mothers\u2019 diets being the differential, once again measuring the quality of the diets eaten by the animals whose products the mothers consumed.\u00a0</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John and Pierre delve into the link between soil health and human health, and how the human gut microbiome is linked to a larger microbiome in the soil. The health of one is reflected in the health of the other.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John and Pierre also discuss Bleu-Blanc-C\u0153ur, and how Pierre developed this organization to address the problems of access to high food quality among populations with lower economic status and producer incentives to serve these groups. Within Bleu-Blanc-C\u0153ur, producers pay close attention to the quality of animal health and diet and are connected with consumers who enjoy better health because of the producer\u2019s choices.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an experienced animal nutritionist, Pierre provides information on the most optimal diets for hens, cows, and pigs. He discusses the impact of a healthy animal diet, on-farm economics, and describes how the longevity, higher fertility, and higher yield of milk and butterfat lead to an increase on the bottom line for farmers employing healthy animal diets.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pierre\u2019s recommended resources (that are not written in French):</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://michaelpollan.com/books/the-omnivores-dilemma/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by Michael Pollack</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about Pierre\u2019s work to improve the nutritional and environmental quality of our food, visit the Bleu-Blanc-C\u0153ur website</span> <a href=\"https://www.bleu-blanc-coeur.org/c/127/What-is-Bleu-Blanc-Coeur\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre_Weill2/publications\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Follow Pierre\u2019s research, and read the results of past peer-reviewed studies.</span></a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our community impact spot for this episode is</span> <a href=\"http://notill.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No-Till on the Plains</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a non-profit organization that provides education, networking, and inspiration for growers who focus on soil health.

Larry also heads programs researching the identification and behaviors of plant secondary compounds and insect pheromones that affect host finding and other behaviors.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, Larry and I discuss plant and insect communications, soil communities, and the concept of biological buffering - the capacity of biology in the soil to absorb large amounts of nutrients that are applied and contain those in their cells and release them over a period of time. We also talk about Larry\u2019s new initiatives in the city of Cleveland to incorporate urban agricultural systems. I had a lot of fun with this episode - some of the topics Larry touches on are absolutely fascinating.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Episode 8 - Larry Phelan - Highlights</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3:10 - What are the memorable moments leading up to where Larry is today?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larry was trained as a chemical ecologist - where he would identify pheromones and plant attractants</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As he started talking to organic farmers, he noticed they had fewer issues with insect pests than conventional farmer neighbors</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5:30 - What were the differences that Larry noticed in organic farming?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, many organic farmers were doing their own research</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many organic farmers had animals integrated into their farms</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf we have healthy soil, then we are going to have a healthy plant, and insects don\u2019t like healthy plants\u201d - Larry was seeing the truth to this and wanted to test</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Larry wanted to figure out if insects could tell a difference between plants from organic farms, and if this was more related to the short-term effects of fertilizer or the long-term effects of mismanaged soil</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The results: Regardless of fertilizer used, the plants growing in soil from the organic farm received few insects eggs</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9:20 - \u00a0Biological Buffering</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an influx of organic matter, you create a soil community that is beneficial to the plant</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nutrients absorbed into the soil community are released over time - putting the plants in better nutrient balance</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plants are almost always limited by nitrogen levels - they\u2019re going to take all they can get and will take more than they can deal with</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insects are also limited by nitrogen, so plants with excess nitrogen are very nutritious for insects</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No difference in production between organic and conventional farms</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">15:20 - Why can insects not utilize plants as a food source that doesn\u2019t contain as many amino acids</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free amino acids can short circuit the plant defense system - Insects get these free amino acids they don\u2019t have to break down</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proteins vary in digestibility in insects</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">18:20 - What had surprised during Larry\u2019s research into all of this?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30% ammonia and 70% nitrate resulted in best plant growth</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where the plant was out of balance, that\u2019s where the insects grew the largest and had the best survivorship</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Survivorship of insects dropped as they approached the 30/70 ammonia/nitrate ratio</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22:40 - What is some practical advice growers can implement?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of organic matter added to the soil to sustain a beneficial microbial community</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important to distinguish between old organic matter and biologically active organic matter - need to focus on active organic matter</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">26:10 - What is the impact of a nitrogen application on soil biological profile?</span>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plants can shut out mycorrhizae and can grow a shallow root system</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the plant invests in growth above ground, it doesn\u2019t have as effective of a root system to gather water and nutrients</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t want plants to encounter any extremes</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starter fertilizer isn\u2019t allowing plants to grow resilience they need and can cause plant growth to stall out</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">35:00 - Applying only insoluble start applications</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resulting in large root systems</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High phosphorus levels without phosphorus application \u00a0</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mineral profiles not very different in organic plants regardless of fertilizer application</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">38:10 - What is something that Larry believes to be true about modern agriculture that is different from mainstream views?</span>\u00a0</p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of soluble fertilizers has been one of the most disruptive practices in mainstream farming</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How different organic farms view what they do - Conventional farmers have a prescriptive approach. Organic farmers had more of a system perspective</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTied up\u201d nitrogen isn\u2019t a bad thing - It gives you \u201cmoney in the bank\u201d in your soil</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">41:30 - What is a resource Larry would recommend?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots of great advances in organic research</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://attra.ncat.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATTRA</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/site/national/home/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Natural Resources Conservation Service</span></a></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">43:10 - What is a question Larry wishes he was asked?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soils in urban centers under vacant lots opening the possibility of urban farming</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do what degree has the legacy of smokestacks, heavy metals, etc affected soil community. Can these soils be rejuvenated or are these soils effectively lost?</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The influx of organic matter are reducing levels of lead and the bioavailability of the lead - allowing cities to reduce the danger of lead in soil</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lead is going to be there - need to find a way to bring it out</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">49:20 - Damaging impacts of chronic pesticide use and exposure</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Feedback & Booking</strong></p> <p>Please send your feedback, requests for topics or guests, or booking request have a Podcast episode recorded LIVE at your event -- to <a href=\"mailto:production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com\">production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com</a>.

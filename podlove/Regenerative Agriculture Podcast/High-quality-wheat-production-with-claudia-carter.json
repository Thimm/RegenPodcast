Originally from Ecuador, Claudia leads research around the marketability of California wheat and helps to develop and maintain domestic and international markets for this commodity. Through a partnership with the University of California Davis, the California Wheat Commission tests in-field performance of wheat yields and quality. With their in-house research lab, the Commission also develops pasta, bread, and other products to test wheat varieties for performance.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, Claudia describes her educational journey in cereal sciences, and her focus on the durum quality parameters that processors need to develop a good pasta. John and Claudia discuss biofortification, the process of breeding wheat varieties for a specific nutritional profile. For years, bakers have demanded wheat varieties with lower mineral content, since the presence of minerals interferes with flour performance. Claudia describes the work being done by wheat geneticist, Dr. Jorge Dubcovsky, to reverse this trend and breed wheat varieties with increased quality and nutritional value. Claudia also talks about the function of protein content in baking, and why higher quality wheat is essential for bakers to develop a premium product. If you\u2019re a grain producer, you will find the information in this episode especially useful.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resources:</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://californiawheat.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">California Wheat Commission</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://smallgrains.wsu.edu/grain-quality-resources/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Washington State University Wheat & Small Grains</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://ndwheat.com/publications/cropqualityreports/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Dakota Wheat Commission</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.agronomy.k-state.edu/extension/crop-production/wheat/index.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kansas State University Wheat Production</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://wholegrainscouncil.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whole Grains Council</span></a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, helping professional growers make more money using regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you grow on a large scale and are looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\">800-495-6603\u00a0</a>to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p>", "publicationDate": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 11:52:19 +0000", "duration": "45:10", "poster": "https://ssl-static.libsyn.com/p/assets/d/1/6/2/d1629a78885f4c0b/RegenerativeAgricultureShow-Show-main.png", "link": "https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/high-quality-wheat-production-with-claudia-carter/", "audio": [{"url": "https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/High-Quality_Wheat_Production_with_Claudia_Carter.mp3?dest-id=698390", "size": "87493709", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "John Kempf"}]}

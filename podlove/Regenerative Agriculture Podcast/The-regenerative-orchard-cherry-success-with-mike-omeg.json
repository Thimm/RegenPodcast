Mike is an innovator with the vision for new approaches and the analytical mind to measure results. He\u2019s tested myriad techniques in his quest for the best and most profitable methods of growing cherries, and was awarded the Good Fruit Grower award by the Fruit Grower News in 2017.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this conversation, John and Mike delve into the type of bio-intensive system Mike has developed and the data he has collected in his trials. Mike has shown that profitable large-scale agriculture and regenerative practices are entirely compatible and speaks to how his operation has scaled regenerative practices. He also thinks deeply about return on investment, the economic growth of his operation, and discusses the positive impact that regenerative methods have had.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believing that one of the fastest ways to improve soils is to grow a healthy crop, Mike explains his view of the tree as the conduit for putting carbon into our soils more efficiently than mulch or compost. Supported with the correct nutrition, the tree is simultaneously building this year\u2019s crop and boosting nutrient levels in the soil for building future crops.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the episode, Mike gives in-depth information on his experiments with different types of cover crops saying, \"When we talk about having a return on our investment, we need to have every seed that goes into that mix be there because we know it\u2019s going to earn us a return - not because we want to feel good that we're maybe doing something that we read in a book was important.\u201d</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Close to the end of this conversation, Omeg says, \u201cI'm excited for every day to bring new challenges in farming. And focusing upon biological and restorative agriculture has just brought a real sense of joy to me when I walk through the orchard. It's exciting, and I love it.\u201d Mike is truly an important figure in the landscape of stone fruit production.

Her family farm has been in no-till production since 1980. When she took the reigns in 2010 she additionally pursued a wonderfully complex diversified cover-cropping, mixed species, multi-income-stream approach that is highly thought-out, yet fluid.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah has visited growers the world over in direct communication about their production systems. Her experience is broad, yet she consistently finds the most successful producers reducing erosion, increasing soil microbiology and working with nature. She has since become a champion of regenerative agriculture.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, you will find particularly useful information on cover/crop/animal/bee systems in grain-based production. Sarah expands on her compelling vision for the regenerative future in agriculture with multiple examples and options to fit any farm.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discuss:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How learning and education for farmers is linked to farm profitability</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goal-based thinking in agriculture - what it is and how it works better than following any one methodology such as organic, no-till, sustainable, etc.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Techniques for preventing erosion</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Techniques for reducing fuel consumption of tractors and equipment</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving degraded soils</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fertilizer reduction</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Resources</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Civilizations-David-R-Montgomery/dp/0520272900/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1532717033&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Dirt%2C+The+Erosion+of+Civilizations%2C+by+David+Montgomery\"> Dirt, The Erosion of Civilizations, by David Montgomery</a></p> <p><strong>\u00a0</strong></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Feedback & Booking</strong></p> <p>Please send your feedback, requests for topics or guests, or booking request have a Podcast episode recorded LIVE at your event -- to <a href=\"mailto:production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com\">production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com</a>.

With baseline carbon and nature foot-printing in place, progress will be closely monitored. Input costs have already reduced, with livestock now wintering outside on grass. FAI anticipates increasing its herd/flock size while also becoming global warming neutral and boosting biodiversity. In documenting and showcasing the transition in progress, they hope to inspire other farmers and companies to join the regenerative agriculture movement. Farm Gate presenter, ffinlo Costain, talks to farm manager Clare Hill, and regenerative farmer and consultant, Caroline Grindrod, from https://www.rootsofnature.co.uk/</p>\n<p>Produced by Farmwel.</p>\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/farmgate/message", "publicationDate": "Fri, 07 Feb 2020 09:36:53 GMT", "duration": "00:38:41", "poster": "https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_nologo/2711999/2711999-1574391729333-2d7ba743ea53.jpg", "link": "https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93", "audio": [{"url": "https://anchor.fm/s/10c2c51c/podcast/play/10225379/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2020-1-7%2F47194726-44100-1-e153d99c42146.mp3", "size": "37144874", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "ffinlo Costain"}]}

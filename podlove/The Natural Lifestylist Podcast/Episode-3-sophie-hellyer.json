Tony\u2019s work is based around the premise that if we can recognise where nature is missing from our lives, we can reconnect with it and fall back in love with it, and in doing so can shake the angst-inducing monkey off our collective back.", "poster": "https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded/2244572/2244572-1567535924043-712a035e2cb6.jpg", "link": "https://anchor.fm/s/df98870/podcast/www.tonyriddle.com"}, "title": "Episode 3: Sophie Hellyer", "subtitle": "Episode 3: Sophie Hellyer", "summary": "<p>I really enjoyed my time behind the mic with the one that is Sophie Hellyer - what a being she is.</p>\n<p><br />\nI had just completed 20 slow and sticky barefoot miles and found that we only had 20 mins to drop the mic! Yes, 20 minutes might seem short in time, but it was punchy and definitely didn\u2019t fall short in delivering the integrity of Sophie\u2019s sustainability message. You never know which way a conversation is going to go, but I was delighted with the direction of this. As a father to three daughters I found this particular sustainability conversation of vital importance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can find out about all of Sophie\u2019s endeavours including her risefierce reteats via <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sophiehellyer/\">@sophiehellyer</a> or by heading to www.sophiehellyer.com.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you liked the conversation then please show some love, by spreading the message wide and far.

Tony\u2019s work is based around the premise that if we can recognise where nature is missing from our lives, we can reconnect with it and fall back in love with it, and in doing so can shake the angst-inducing monkey off our collective back.", "poster": "https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded/2244572/2244572-1567535924043-712a035e2cb6.jpg", "link": "https://anchor.fm/s/df98870/podcast/www.tonyriddle.com"}, "title": "Episode 4: Micheal Thornton", "subtitle": "Episode 4: Micheal Thornton", "summary": "<p>I had the pleasure of getting behind the mic with the man with the sustainability plan; Michael Thornton.</p>\n<p>Michael Thornton is an engineer, entreprenuer and the founder of Carbon Analytics. After close to a decade working on sustainable water, power and projects around the world as a civil engineer, Michael accepted a scholarship for an MBA in social entrepreneurship at Oxford University with a question in mind? How do we transform our global economy to understand and value the natural world it depends on?&nbsp; And how do we do it without relying on government?</p>\n<p>Carbon Analytics, his company that automates carbon footprinting for businesses and supply chains is the result of that question. Michael and I continue the conversation away from the mic\u2019s as we go for a 10 mile run to finish my 30 for the day and ever since I have been spreading his carbon analytics message to my brothers and sisters.</p>\n<p>Rain Forest Alliance</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle1</p>\n<p>Extinction Rebellion</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/tony-riddle-extinctionrebellion</p>\n<p>Surfers Against Sewage</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle-surfersagainstsewage</p>\n<p>Care International</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle</p>\n<p>Client Earth</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle-clientearth</p>\n<p>Greenpeace Uk</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle-greenpeace</p>", "publicationDate": "Wed, 18 Sep 2019 18:56:52 GMT", "duration": "00:30:11", "poster": "https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_episode/2244572/2244572-1568834992397-b51c92a299f04.jpg", "link": "https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-4-Micheal-Thornton-e5eenn", "audio": [{"url": "https://anchor.fm/s/df98870/podcast/play/4716727/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2019-8-18%2F24103797-44100-2-746c2bba82d68.mp3", "size": "29005504", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Tony Riddle"}]}

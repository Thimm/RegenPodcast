Maybe start at your farmers market, who is producing what, who is building soil?<br /><br />Esther would like to focus this year more on getting Farmers off color into the conversation as over 90% of farmers are white. And we need more people not fewer people on the land!<br /><br />Cienaga has about:</p><ul><li>20M dollars outstanding in the NoRegrets initiative</li><li>28 investment outstanding</li><li>of which 2 are not performing</li></ul><p><br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/esther-park/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/05/21/esther-park</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />Please hit the share button if you think this interview is relevant for someone you know!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

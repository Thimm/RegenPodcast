His goal is to \u201ctransfer as much of the agriculture landscape as possible, to draw down carbon and uplift the local communities\u201d To do that we need to look systemically and target the businesses who are making the big purchases and adding value to the ingredients. <br /><br />Then we dived into the difficulties of \u201cThe logistics of bringing diversity to the market place\u201d. Everything is build around mono crops, coming from a few immense farms and a few players spread to very diverse customers (us). \u201cIf a farmer no longer has to optimise for a single crop in order to sell bulk and have very low margins, but could sell 5 or even 10 different crops of of the same piece of land. And have those crops efficiently distributed to all of the different buyers, in a way that system of supply can aggregate at the appropriate scales and then distribute at the appropriate scales. We would have a system of supply which can meet a healthy ecosystem where it\u2019s at.<br /><br />\u201dA potential solution: software to allow distributed purchases from diverse agri eco systems. That\u2019s why Gregory and his team are working on <b>Agrispecific Blockchains</b>.\u00a0<br /><br />Tips from Gregory on how to start in impact investing in Regenerative Agriculture:</p><ul><li>Where are places where I already have some ideas on the extractive economy looks like. If it\u2019s vegetables, or commodities, te coffee, cosmetics, or real estate.\u00a0</li><li>And then ask yourself the question: \u201cwhat might a play look like in the new disruptive, distributed, regenerative economy in this place where I\u2019m already excited about?\u201d</li></ul><p><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/05/gregory-landua</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

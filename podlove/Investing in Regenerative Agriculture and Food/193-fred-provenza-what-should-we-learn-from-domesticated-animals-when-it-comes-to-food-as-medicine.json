We also discuss what they can teach us about rediscovering our nutritional wisdom.<br /><br />This series is supported by the A Team Foundation, who support food and land projects that are ecologically, economically and socially conscious. They contribute to the wider movement that envisions a future where real food is produced by enlightened agriculture and access to it is equal. The A Team are looking to make more investments and grants in the space of bionutrients.<b><em> </em></b>You can find out more on <a href=\"http://ateamfoundation.org/\">ateamfoundation.org</a>.<br />---------------------------------------------------</p><p>Join our Gumroad community, discover the tiers and benefits on <a href=\"https://www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag\">www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag</a>.\u00a0</p><p>Support our work:</p><ul><li>Share it</li><li>Give a 5-star rating</li><li>Buy us a coffee\u2026 or a meal! <a href=\"https://www.ko-fi.com/regenerativeagriculture\">www.Ko-fi.com/regenerativeagriculture</a></li></ul><p>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>Research shows that animals are perfectly able to feed themselves when they have the cultural background and intergenerational education plus the diversity in plants and feed they need.

Advice from Ruud Look at ecological efficiencies, why are we doing this on this piece of land? Why are you using animals for xyz?<br /><br />If Ruud could wave a magic wand he would stop using animals in our food system. <br /><br />Find all notes and show notes here:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/23/ruud-zanders</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

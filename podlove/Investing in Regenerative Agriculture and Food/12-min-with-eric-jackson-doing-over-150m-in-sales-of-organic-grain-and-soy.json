There isn\u2019t enough organic farmland in the US, so Eric started on a journey which led 18 months ago to the founding of Pipeline Foods, to build the infrastructure needed to get organic grain, corn and soy from the farmer to the food processor. Thus giving the farmers certainty and getting more farmers through the difficult transition process.<br /><br />Why are they focussing on broad acre crops and not livestock, or produce? Because of the scale that they can bring. Broad acre crops cover many many millions of acres and when you can bring them under organic and hopefully soon organic plus/beyond organic management can really have a huge impact on local/regional climate systems, biodiversity and water quality (which we briefly touched upon in the interview) <br /><br /><br />Full interview, notes and show notes can be found here:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/07/18/eric-jackson</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

Osvaldo experienced this problem first hand as his farther got 0,20/0,25 cents for his organic oranges, which were sold &apos;fresh&apos; in an organic supermarket in Milan for 3,5 euro. Biorfarm pays 0,90 cents to their orange farmers.www.biorfarm.com is now getting ready to scale and will try to raise crowdfunding in the next months.\u00a0<br /><br />Some key take aways from the conversation:</p><ul><li>The farmer is happy (with a platform like Biorfarm) because (s)he gets respect as a farmers.</li><li>The land is the past the present and the future of the farmer, but we don&apos;t give them space to improve it.</li><li>Most farmers want to leave the land in a better shape (better soil health) to their children. Being stuck in the current value they simply can&apos;t.\u00a0</li><li>Fresh is a supermarket could mean anything.</li></ul><p><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/12/08/osvaldo-de-falco</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

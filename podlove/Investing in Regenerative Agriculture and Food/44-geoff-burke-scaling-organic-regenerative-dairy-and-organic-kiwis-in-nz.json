Please have a look and let us know what you think! <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0BR3v-_2aO8\">https://youtu.be/0BR3v-_2aO8</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />Things we discussed:</p><ul><li>One of the things holding the agro ecological transition back is the myth that regenerative agriculture is less profitable. And that is wrong especially in New Zealand. You are able to run leaner and have more resilient returns</li><li>Organic is important, independently audited and gives the consumers some comfort and drives the premium. It has been successful for 20/30 years</li><li>We should focus on profit per acre instead of yields of acre\u00a0</li><li>\u00a0If you only substitute your non organic inputs with organic inputs you are destined to fail\u00a0</li><li>You need to completely redesign your management system\u00a0</li><li>There is a lot of water quality regulation coming in New Zealand\u00a0</li><li>Farmers are asking themselves how to farm and have the social licences from their community to keep farming\u00a0</li><li>New Zealand has an amazing climate, on most farms animals can be outside all year round\u00a0</li></ul><p><br />Organic Kiwis\u00a0</p><ul><li>Why are organic kiwis interesting? Market is booming\u00a0</li><li>Kiwis need \u2018winter chilling\u2019, in the current kiwi region there isn\u2019t enough winter chilling and producers use a chemical to \u2018fake\u2019 the winter, this isn\u2019t allowed in organic production</li><li>It isn\u2019t easy to deploy big quantities of (institutional) investment capital</li></ul><p><br />Organic regenerative dairy\u00a0</p><ul><li>Dairy is a major industry but created huge environmental issues, mostly on water quality, run off etc.\u00a0</li><li>Regulation is becoming much stricter and forcing the intensive farms to change\u00a0</li><li>Geoff is focussed on one water catchment, to improve the water quality\u00a0</li><li>In a few years the pasture will be much more diverse, going from 1 or 2 types to 15-20 types\u00a0</li><li>You will see a lot more trees on the farms, nuts, for fodder, wood\u00a0</li><li>Planting medicinal plants so cows can self medicate\u00a0</li><li>Different breed of cows, more robust, resilient\u00a0</li><li>Big farms by definition have to focus on the export\u00a0</li></ul><p><br />If Geoff could change one thing overnight, it would be increasing dramatically the amount of capital deployed in regenerative agriculture. <br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/\"></a></p> <a href=\"https://www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show</a><p><b>Feedback, ideas, suggestions? </b><br />- Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a> <br />- Get in touch <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a><br /><br /><b>Join our newsletter</b> on <a href=\"http://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>! <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag\">Support the show</a><br /><br /><b><em>Thanks for listening and sharing!</em></b>...</p>", "publicationDate": "Tue, 18 Dec 2018 14:46:42 +0100", "duration": "3573", "poster": "https://storage.buzzsprout.com/variants/s94e7a992otlw6o4epmfjaqrb2bw/60854458c4d1acdf4e1c2f79c4137142d85d78e379bdafbd69bd34c85f5819ad.jpg", "link": "https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/12/21/geoff-burke/", "audio": [{"url": "https://www.buzzsprout.com/1154870/4144841-44-geoff-burke-scaling-organic-regenerative-dairy-and-organic-kiwis-in-nz.mp3", "size": "42907456", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Koen van Seijen"}]}

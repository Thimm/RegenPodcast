You need to look at Landscape scale/Ecosystem scale to really understand the risks of your investments.\u00a0</li><li>what you need to look for in landscape partnerships to identify the good ones where you can make investments. Good local partnerships greatly reduce the risk of agriculture investments.\u00a0</li></ul><p><br />And we discussed some tools Sara and her team are working on:</p><ul><li>a tool for investors to find Landscape Partnerships which are working (and thus greatly reducing the risks of the investment)</li><li>\u00a0tools and methodes for larger financial institutions to screen their current agriculture investment portfolio for stranded assets. Or at least make sure they don&apos;t to add more stranded assets to their portfolio.</li></ul><p><br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/10/sara-scherr</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

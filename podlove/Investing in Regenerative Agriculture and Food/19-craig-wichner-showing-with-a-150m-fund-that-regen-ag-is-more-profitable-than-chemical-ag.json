From soil carbon to drones and from deep roots to how we can show that regenerative agriculture is more profitable than conventional chemical based agriculture.<br /><br /><b>Some key takeaways:</b></p><ul><li>\u201cHow do you shift from a chemical based agriculture to a biological based agriculture?\u201d</li><li>\u201cShowing organic farmland is more profitable than conventional agriculture!\u201d</li><li>Farmland\u201cOrganic farmland we have managed generates 72% more revenue per acre.\u201d \u201c53% of US farmland growing 2 commodity crops, corn and soy.\u201d</li><li>\u201cAt least 4-6 times more revenue per acre growing sweet corn than commodity corn\u201d</li></ul><p><br />The big shift comes from average farmer understand that sustainable agri is more profitable than chemical farming. Really looking at the land, what work best on this land in a sustainable way?<br />\u201cWhat is the best way to maximise biological productivity and economic value?\u201d <br /><br /><b>Future developments:</b><br />They just completed a permanent crop suitability study for some of the land. Looking at the mix of perennial systems plus open ground. Next year they will be getting more technology on the farm, aerial imagery with drones. <br /><br /><b>Consumers:</b><br />\u201cMilk is the gateway drug to organic products\u201d as first time mothers start asking questions about the milk they give to their newborns. Organic standards aren\u2019t the holy grail, there are some issues with it. <br /><br />Show notes and links<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/27/craig-wichner/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/27/craig-wichner</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />Please hit the share button if you think this interview is relevant for someone you know!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

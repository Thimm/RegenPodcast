It all started with elephants and initially producing t-shirts locally to support community development. Now they are mostly active in the market of co2 credits and large scale ecosystem restoration. Still with a very strong focus on Community Development. <br /><br />I asked about Mike&apos;s ideas and tips for the impact investing community and how to get involved in this often very difficult work and luckily he shared them with me. Enjoy!<br /><br />The last 15 min we discussed Impact Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and I decided to share this as a separate podcast, you can find it here: <br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/05/07/mike-korchinsky-2</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/03/14/mike-korchinsky-1</a>.\u00a0<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

And what does it do with nutrient density and healthcare? Catherine&apos;s work focused primarily on disruption in the agriculture and food industries. She is the co-author, together with Tony Seba, of \u201cRethinking Food &amp; Agriculture 2020-2030: The second domestication of plants and animals, the disruption of the cow and the collapse of the industrial livestock industry&quot;. <br /><br />The report shows how the modern food disruption, made possible by rapid advances in precision biology and an entirely new model of production, will have profound implications not just for the industrial agriculture industry, but for the wider economy, society, and the environment.<br /><br />This interview with Catherine might be uncomfortable for some in the regenerative food and ag space, who will struggle to call this real food. Regardless if this is happening as RethinkX claims, I think we need to pay attention to the developments, investment flows and potential impact on industrial animal farming (which would be great), farmers (not so great) and agriculture land (mixed prospects).<br /><br />I had and still have a lot of questions about nutrients, hormones and healthcare implications of these developments. <br /><br />But I also have them about industrial animal farming. So I invite you to listen to the interview, read the report and share your feedback!<br /><br />Full RethinkX report on:<br /><a href=\"https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture\">www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture</a>. <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

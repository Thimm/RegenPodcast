Next, we hear from a Dorset farmer, with an update on the highs and lows of her compost tea trials on arable cropland. Moving on to Herefordshire, we discover the exciting potential benefits of agroforestry for disease prevention in apple orchards. And finally, we end up in the Netherlands, where we learn about an innovative business model that is being used to create farming communities! \n\nThanks to our supporters Rebel Kitchen for making this episode possible.\n\nThanks to the contribution this week from the Investing in regenerative Agriculture Podcast.

Over the course of the series, we heard from one listener who offered to share his experience using novel insurance products to manage the risks of both too little and too much rainfall in his own farming operation. This from-the-field perspective was packed with insights, and was such a powerful contribution to our learning that we asked his permission to use the audio for this episode.</p><p><a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/tomferg88\">Tom Ferguson</a> is a farmer in Northern New South Wales, Australia, and this week you\u2019ll hear a conversation between him and Tenacious Ventures Co-Founder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmatthewpryor/\">Matthew Pryor</a>.

These often trigger system changes that are reactionary and have short term gains. When these are practiced over the long term, they often have a degenerative effect on health and the environment.\n\nRegenerative design thinking is the opposite, and is an intentional, premeditated process that involves a high level of observation, analysis, creativity, and looking beyond reductionistic principles while embracing systems thinking and additionality to create regenerative solutions.\n\nRegenerative agriculture has become a powerful force for positive transformation and hope in todays world. And no discussion about agriculture is complete without a conversation about food.\u00a0\n\nFood is the connection between people and the planet so grab a cup of coffee or your favorite running shoes and get ready to take a mental and philosophical leap into the future of food and our planet.", "poster": "https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/29880/full_1650028082-artwork.jpg", "link": "https://snacktivistfoods.com"}, "title": "Seeds of community and Seeds of the Past with Don Scheuerman", "subtitle": "Seeds of community and Seeds of the Past with Don Scheuerman", "summary": "Joni and Don discuss the importance of regenerative agriculture to world-wide long term food production.", "publicationDate": "Thu, 14 Apr 2022 11:35:54 -0700", "duration": "2550", "poster": "https://images.transistor.fm/file/transistor/images/show/29880/full_1650028082-artwork.jpg", "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/afaebfd2", "audio": [{"url": "https://media.transistor.fm/afaebfd2/2ae0385b.mp3", "size": "62443231", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Joni Kindwall-Moore & Don Scheuerman"}, {"name": "Joni Kindwall-Moore & Don Scheuerman"}]}

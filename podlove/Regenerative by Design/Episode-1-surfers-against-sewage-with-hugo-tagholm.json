Tony\u2019s work is based around the premise that if we can recognise where nature is missing from our lives, we can reconnect with it and fall back in love with it, and in doing so can shake the angst-inducing monkey off our collective back.", "poster": "https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded/2244572/2244572-1567535924043-712a035e2cb6.jpg", "link": "https://anchor.fm/s/df98870/podcast/www.tonyriddle.com"}, "title": "Episode 1: Surfers Against Sewage with Hugo Tagholm", "subtitle": "Episode 1: Surfers Against Sewage with Hugo Tagholm", "summary": "<p>I had the pleasure of visiting the mighty Surfers Against Sewage yesterday and getting behind the mic with Hugo Tagholm.</p>\n<p>We discussed sustainability and how this small but powerful organisation are making huge waves. Together, we are the voice of the ocean.We inspire, unite and empower communities to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildlife. They are a grassroots movement that has grown into one of the UK\u2019s most active and successful environmental charities. Not just surfers, not just sewage. They began as a response by the surfing community to the dreadful state of our beaches. Those hardy souls who ventured into the water back then often found themselves swimming in raw sewage. There\u2019s tales of sanitary towels on heads and human poo sandwiched between bodies and boards. Completely unacceptable. The campaign grew loud, proud and strong and thanks to the passion and perseverance of their members \u2014 the UK now enjoys some of the cleanest beaches in Europe. But \u2018Plastic is the new sewage\u2019 as it is now the biggest threat to our beaches, our precious marine eco-system and our happiness. Plastic Free Coastlines and their priority going forward is to fight the plastic pollution that blights our beaches and strangles our seashores. Britain still fails to recycle almost all of its plastic waste but a major government initiative means that could change over the next few years and SAS are once again a leading voice to help shift legislation. SAS were a leading voice in ensuring supermarkets plastic bag charges came into play and they are now working on making a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles part of UK law.</p>\n<p>Rain Forest Alliance</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle1</p>\n<p>Extinction Rebellion</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/tony-riddle-extinctionrebellion</p>\n<p>Surfers Against Sewage</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle-surfersagainstsewage</p>\n<p>Care International</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle</p>\n<p>Client Earth</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle-clientearth</p>\n<p>Greenpeace Uk</p>\n<p>https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tony-riddle-greenpeace</p>", "publicationDate": "Tue, 03 Sep 2019 19:14:39 GMT", "duration": "00:36:49", "poster": "https://d3t3ozftmdmh3i.cloudfront.net/production/podcast_uploaded_episode/2244572/2244572-1567538087855-7d0282ba37956.jpg", "link": "https://anchor.fm/tony-riddle/episodes/Episode-1-Surfers-Against-Sewage-with-Hugo-Tagholm-e579p8", "audio": [{"url": "https://anchor.fm/s/df98870/podcast/play/4482280/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2019-8-3%2F22401062-48000-2-c9f03cf1164f9.mp3", "size": "35396104", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Tony Riddle"}]}

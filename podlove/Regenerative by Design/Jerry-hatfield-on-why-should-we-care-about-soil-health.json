We talk about the role that the soil-plant continuum plays in not only developing the productivity but also the quality of the products that plant is harvested for. Jerry and I discuss the fundamental functions of the soil aggregate structure and the value of gas exchange and water infiltration.</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show & Helping You Grow</strong></p> <p>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/?utm_source=libsyn&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=episode_29\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, leaders in regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you are a large-scale grower looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com?subject=Regenerative%20Agriculture%20Podcast%20listener%20reaching%20out\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-495-6603 extension 344</a>\u00a0to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><strong>Episode 10 - Jerry Hatfield - Highlights</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3:10 - What have been some of the highlights that have lead Jerry to where he is today?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What drives Jerry: \u00a0Finding out how can we improve the efficiency of plants to capture water and light, and put that into productivity</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the role of all this in increasing productivity and quality of what is harvested</span></li> </ul> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5:30 - Why should we care about soil health?</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does the surface of the soil look like?

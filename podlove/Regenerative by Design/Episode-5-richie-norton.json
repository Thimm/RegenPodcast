We instantly hit it off. To be fair there\u2019s not a lot to not like about Richie, so hitting it off is a no brainer. Richie is an ex-rugby player turned Yogi, surfer, adrenaline junkie. He has spent the last 10 years working alongside sports professionals and some of the most respected pioneers of human performance and what has grown out of this is Richie\u2019s own unique blend of Meditation, Breathwork and Yoga to help us live more sustainability. .</p>\n<p>If you liked the conversation then please show some love, by spreading the message wide and far.

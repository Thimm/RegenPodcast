We head to Kenya to hear about tree planting with farmers there and why the future is bright. And we end up in Los Angeles speaking to  a gardener who is reckoning with the words we use and proposing a new approach to the language of regeneration.\n\nThis month\u2019s episode is supported by Treedom - a platform that makes it easy to support a farmer in Africa or South America to plant a tree. When you buy a tree with Treedom you\u2019re financing farmers to plant trees as part of small agroforestry systems, and providing the local know-how and support to ensure those trees have the best start in life and truly benefit the farmers, their communities and the soil. Once you buy a tree you can also follow its journey online. Since they started in 2010, Treedom have planted over a million trees. Let\u2019s green the planet.\n\nWebsite: go.treedom.net/rh5f\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/treedom_trees/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/treedomtrees/\nYoutube: www.youtube.com/channel/UC4LB9MIGsvGknvcSzA9Affg", "publicationDate": "Sun, 30 Aug 2020 17:53:51 +0000", "duration": "00:35:13", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-Tbd9G3rY8xtxPf6g-rCX21w-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/884621986-farmerama-radio-episode-59-upland-restoration-agroforestry-in-kenya-and-the-language-of-regeneration.mp3", "size": "50644684", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

But in Part 3, he learns that the story of Scotland as the victim of colonial practices is just one part of a much bigger narrative. \n\nThe Highlands is one of the least racially diverse parts of the UK, and it would be easy to think of the area as far removed from the UK\u2019s grim colonial history \u2013 a place where racial justice and reparations have no direct relevance. But, as Col discovers, this would be far from the truth.\n\nCol traces the connections \u2013 some indirect, others very concrete \u2013 between the rural landscape he grew up in and global patterns of displacement, exploitation and enslavement. To dig deeper, he speaks with Josina Calliste, co-founder of Land in Our Names (LION) \u2013 a Black-led, grassroots collective committed to reparations in Britain by connecting land and climate justice with racial justice \u2013 and explores what it means to be a person of colour in rural Scotland today.\n\nLanded is produced by Col Gordon and Katie Revell, with Executive Producer Abby Rose.\n\nOur Project Manager is Olivia Oldham.\n\nHuge thanks to Josina Calliste for her guidance and input and to Sarah Nicholas for all her help and support. Thanks also to Jo Barratt.\n\nThe music for Landed is by Dagger Gordon and me, Col Gordon.\n\nThis episode featured David Alston, Josina Calliste, Iain MacKinnon, Srik Narayanan and Philomena de Lima\n\nFunding for the project was provided by the funding platform Necessity.\n\nFarmerama is committed to keeping all our episodes free, and to paying our team a living wage.

It\u2019s set to be a wide-ranging piece of legislation, touching on health, sustainable production, food poverty, food culture, and a lot more besides. It has the potential to be radical and world-leading \u2013 or a huge missed opportunity. Katie spoke to Bella Crowe from Nourish Scotland about the Bill, the upcoming consultation, and the broader context for food in Scotland. Bella also explained the Scottish Food Coalition\u2019s \u201cKitchen Table Talk\u201d initiative: an effort to make sure the consultation is as broad and representative as possible.\n\nTo find out more about the Good Food Nation Bill and the Kitchen Table talks, visit nourishscotland.org", "publicationDate": "Thu, 29 Mar 2018 21:54:01 +0000", "duration": "00:23:40", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000329431836-k0ivoi-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/422043081-farmerama-radio-shorts-good-food-nation-bill-short-mixdown.mp3", "size": "34087136", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

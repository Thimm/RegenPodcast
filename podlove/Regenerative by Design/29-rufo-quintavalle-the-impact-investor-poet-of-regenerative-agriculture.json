He shared his journey into investing in regenerative agriculture and gave a lot of tips on how to start investing in regenerative agriculture and take the plunge! <br /><br />Instead of Silicon Valleys <b>\u201cMove fast and break things, we need move slowly and build things\u201d</b><br /><br />Tips of Rufo:\u00a0</p><ul><li>Don\u2019t be too hasty but don\u2019t be too slow either, set aside a bit of money you can afford to potentially lose and put it to work. \u00a0</li><li>Get yourself educated and learn, but don\u2019t waste the time of entrepreneurs and fund managers, don\u2019t set up endless calls if you have no interest in investing.\u00a0</li><li>Think about where in the value chain you want to invest, the land itself, the processing. Think about the geographies.\u00a0</li><li>Think about water, many places have inadequate water supply, so make sure you take that risk into account.</li></ul><p><br />Alternative proteins: Rufo is extremely interested in fruits and vegetables with high protein content as replacements for animal protein. There are 4000 thousands fruits in the Amazon, and we don\u2019t know what half of them do. And he is a bit worried about some high tech meat replacements. Clean meat. Because if the IP ends up being owned by a few wealthy people, we maybe create more negative social consequences than we create positive one. <br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/01/31/rufo-quintavalle</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

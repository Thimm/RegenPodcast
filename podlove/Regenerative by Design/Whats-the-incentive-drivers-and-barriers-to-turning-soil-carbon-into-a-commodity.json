Drivers and barriers to turning soil carbon into a commodity", "summary": "<div>Experts and tech companies alike are claiming that soil carbon payments hold huge potential as a new revenue stream for farmers and a weapon against climate change. Yet, others say it\u2019s all hype.

We tackle  issues and barriers in soil carbon, and the potential benefits and consequences of moving from practice-based to outcomes-based approaches to measurement and verification. We also discuss why a focus on accuracy in soil carbon measurement is actually holding the industry back, as well as the role of big food companies in soil health.</div><div><br /></div><div>On the panel:</div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.farminstitute.org.au/about/afi-team/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Heath </a>- Executive Director, <a href=\"https://www.farminstitute.org.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Australian Farm Institute</a></li><li><a href=\"https://au.linkedin.com/in/rob-waterworth-85917a8\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Waterworth </a>- CEO,<a href=\"https://flintpro.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> FLINTpro</a></li><li><a href=\"https://au.linkedin.com/in/paul-scoullar-b08a2a78\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Scoullar</a> - Strategic Sourcing Manager, <a href=\"https://aus.mars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Petcare</a></li></ul><div><br /></div><div>This episode, brought to you by the <a href=\"https://agthentic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AgThentic Group</a>, was recorded at a live <a href=\"https://www.ausagritech.org/\" target=\"_blank\">AusAgritech</a> Meetup sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.foodbytesworld.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FoodBytes! by Rabobank</a>.

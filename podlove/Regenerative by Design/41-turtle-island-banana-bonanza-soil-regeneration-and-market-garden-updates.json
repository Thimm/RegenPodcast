We head to Java, to celebrate the fantastic diversity of Indonesian bananas. In North Dakota we learn about the ecological potential of regenerative farming, and how farms can (and should) boost their local economies. We end up in the UK, with an end-of-year update from our regular marketing garden reporter. Thanks to our supporters Rebel Kitchen, for making this episode possible!", "publicationDate": "Sun, 30 Dec 2018 09:00:15 +0000", "duration": "00:33:46", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000464013720-0vn55g-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-41", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/550558611-farmerama-radio-farmerama-41.mp3", "size": "48689781", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

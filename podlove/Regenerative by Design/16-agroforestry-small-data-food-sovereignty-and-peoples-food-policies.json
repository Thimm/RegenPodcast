He fills us in on his  agroforestry setup or \u20183D farming\u2019, where he grows organic apples and cereals on his 150 acres in Cambridgeshire. We also hear a few thoughts from Ben Raskin, head of horticulture at the Soil Association, who is just starting a new agroforestry project in Wiltshire at Helen Browning\u2019s Organic Farm.\n\nOur co-host Abby shares a tool she initially created for her family\u2019s farm to help them build a more resilient business using \u2018small data\u2019. Now other farmers are using it in the UK and Chile, in particular we hear from Davenport Vineyards about how they have used it to help their vineyard prosper.\n\nWe finish with a bit of a food sovereignty focus \u2013 two reports from different ends of Britain both building people\u2019s food policies: in Scotland we hear about the \u2018Good Food Nation Bill\u2019 and Dee Butterly, talks us through \u2018The People\u2019s Food Policy\u2019 supported by The Landworker\u2019s Alliance. In our divided world we wonder if food and farming could be a web that will connect us all.", "publicationDate": "Fri, 10 Mar 2017 18:53:54 +0000", "duration": "00:31:55", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000211940648-5bk7rn-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-16", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/311734636-farmerama-radio-farmerama-16.mp3", "size": "30704161", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

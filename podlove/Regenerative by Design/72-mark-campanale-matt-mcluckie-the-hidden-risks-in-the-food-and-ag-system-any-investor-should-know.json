This includes regional and global industry sectors such as agri-business, plastics and textiles. <br /><br />As natural capital declines, Planet Tracker is working with capital markets to measure the extent to which macroeconomic health, also referred to as sovereign health, depends on the sustainable management of natural capital. <br /><br />Through the lens of agriculture, Planet Tracker is assessing how declines in natural capital create increased credit risks for sovereign investors. In agriculture-based economies, declines in natural capital can decrease production, impacting industry revenue, tax contributions, employment and soft commodity exports, resulting in falling treasury receipts including of foreign currency. <br /><br />Find all notes and show notes here:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2020/02/05/mark-campanale-matt-mcluckie</a>.\u00a0<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

Steward-owned companies make a legally binding commitment to their employees and customers: that the company is not a speculative good or commodity but a group of people working for a purpose.<br /><br />Full interview with Armin and all show notes and links here:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/19/armin-steuernagel</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

For farmer\u2019s son, Col Gordon, the forced displacement of people during the Highland Clearances, and the dismantling of Gaelic language and traditions, are best understood through the lens of colonisation. Now, only small pockets of Gaelic culture remain, detached from the conditions and ways of life that they evolved in.\n\nIn this episode, Col learns about the pre-colonial attitudes of the Gaels towards the land, investigating the question of what came before the family farm. What he finds is a system based on community and collective work, with a yearly migration to the hillside \u201cshieling\u201d to graze the cattle and rejuvenate the spirit. Above all, what he finds is a fundamentally different way of relating to the land \u2013 an understanding that people belong to the land, not the other way around.\n\nCould a revival of these \u201cindigenous\u201d practices, and these relationships to the land, provide a route forward? And, if so, how might we \u201cre-indigenise\u201d in an open and inclusive way?\n\nLanded is produced by Col Gordon and Katie Revell, with Executive Producer Abby Rose.

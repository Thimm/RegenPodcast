So, what can commodity agriculture learn from organic farming? <br /><br />Our guest this week is Amy Bruch, a sixth-generation farmer of row crops, small grains, pulses, and oilseeds, and 2021 Organic Trade Association Organic Farmer of the Year. After starting her career as a systems engineer in food manufacturing, Amy travelled to work on large-scale soil improvement projects in Brazil. This experience \u201cfarming in another postcode\u201d then led to her approach managing the family farm back in Eastern Nebraska, and turning nearly 2,500 acres into organic production.</p><p><br />In this episode, Amy talks about:</p><ul></ul><ul><li>How her experience improving degraded, acidic soils in regional Brazil makes her a better farmer at Cyclone Farms today</li><li>The benefits of combining organic production techniques AND new innovations in technology</li><li>How a focus on soil health is a gateway for more farmers to not only sequester more carbon, but also realize meaningful benefits for their crops &amp; bottom line</li><li>Why current organic farming standards are a potential onramp for farmers to adopt more \u201cclimate smart\u201d agricultural practices</li></ul><p>For more information and resources, <a href=\"https://tenacious.ventures/insights#podcast-episodes\">visit our website</a>.<br /></p><p><br /></p>", "publicationDate": "Wed, 24 Aug 2022 20:00:00 +0000", "duration": "00:33:42", "poster": "https://feeds.backtracks.fm/feeds/series/a19b8b0e-6913-11ec-800c-0e4caa76571f/episodes/1795dcd0-22a8-11ed-bac9-120f0f1367ef/images/main.png?1668664899252", "link": "https://tenacious.ventures/podcast-episodes/amy-bruch-organic-farming-technology-commodities", "audio": [{"url": "https://backtracks.fm/tenacious/pr/179247dc-22a8-11ed-bac9-120f0f1367ef/ep143_amybruch_cyclonefarms.mp3?s=1&sd=1&u=1661234231", "size": "48565146", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": null}

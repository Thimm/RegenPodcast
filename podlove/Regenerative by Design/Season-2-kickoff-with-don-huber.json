Don was our first guest on the show in Season 1, and</span> <a href=\"http://regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-dr-don-huber\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can listen to the first-ever Regenerative Agriculture Podcast episode with Don, here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr.</span> <a href=\"http://www.nvlv.nl/downloads/Dr_Huber_bio.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don Huber</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a leading plant pathologist,\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://ag.purdue.edu/btny/Pages/Profile.aspx?strAlias=huberd&amp;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Emeritus at Purdue University</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and prolific author, contributor, or editor of more than 300 published academic writings and three books.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more than 50 years, Don has been a renowned researcher and principal voice in the field of crop-plant pathology, especially as it relates to the overlapping spheres of mineral fertility and microbial ecology.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a research partner, consultant or advisor, he has contributed to work in more than a dozen countries and been awarded numerous honors and awards for his copious scientific contributions.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critical among these, has been his work in: nitrogen efficiency; nitrification inhibitors; plant and microbial metabolite interactions; development of aminopeptidase profiling, whereby unknown micro-organisms can be rapidly identified and then cultured, by their amino acid profile; and copious work vastly furthering the understanding of mineral/ microbe/ disease/ herbicide interaction.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some heavy science topics in this show that may compel your own further research. But no matter what or where you grow, there are some truly high-value practicalities laid out in this conversation.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all makes him a really exciting guest to have on the show.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, listen as Dr. Don Huber covers the following and more:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing vs. non-reducing sugars and the role they play in energy storage and metabolism.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High levels of</span> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reducing sugars</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(glucose and fructose) are an attractant of insects and disease.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manganese is an enzyme cofactor for the</span> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sucrose phosphate synthase enzyme</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that converts glucose and fructose.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing sugars are exuded from roots, attracting pythium, Phytophthora, actinomycetes, oomycetes. Non-reducing sugars are less exuded and a poorer food source for these organisms.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most soil pathogens remain dormant and harmless until activated by external nutrient sources. The grower can control this.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In disease suppressive soils, soil bacteria colonize the resting structures of dormant fungal or oomycete spores, causing fungistasis, keeping them dormant.</span> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sugars, as root exudates, disrupt this suppression by giving bacteria a more ready food source.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airborne pathogens are also attracted to a</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deficient</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nutrient profile of the above-ground plant parts.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rusts require an exogenous source of Zinc on the leaf surface for spores to germinate.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Siderophores can be prevented by antibiotics, nutritional integrity, and immune responses.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some early fungicides did not affect the fungus, but rather the amino acid profile of the plant, denying the fungus its food source. Apple Scab example.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aminopeptidase profiling that Don developed. Not directly practicable for farmers, but a fascinating and now commonly used lab practice, in microbiological research.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nitrogen is not just N, from the periodic table.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ammonium, Nitrate and Amino Nitrogen must be considered as unique substances, that affect systems differently and should be used differently.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Molybdenum\u2019s role in the Nitrate Reductase enzyme functioning, and other details on nitrogen conversion and storage.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ammonium is the most</span> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">efficient</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">form of Nitrogen for corn and wheat.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nitrate requires 12-16% of all sugars just to convert to a plant usable form.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ammonia, however, cannot be stored and must be metabolized as its taken up, which can be stressful for very small plants.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Efficient urea use and its reliance on the relatively abundant urease enzyme to hydrolyze ammonia.</span></li> </ul> <p>At the end of the show, Don gives this reminder:</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>\u201cIt\u2019s truly remarkable how everything is integrated to such a dynamic degree that it all relates together\u2026 Just look at the whole picture and make sure that we're meeting the needs of the plant\u2026 We need to look for the specific elements, but recognize that they're all part of an integrated system.\u201d</em>\u00a0~Don Huber</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more reading of Dr. Huber\u2019s work, view his</span> <a href=\"http://www.nvlv.nl/downloads/Dr_Huber_bio.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">selected bibliography and further bio</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to check out the links below as I have some exciting announcements to make!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enjoy!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John and The Regenerative Agriculture Podcast team at AEA</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PS...\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am excited to announce that, in alignment with my mission of making regenerative agriculture the new standard for agriculture, and due to popular demand, I am opening an online academy, the Regen.Ag Academy!

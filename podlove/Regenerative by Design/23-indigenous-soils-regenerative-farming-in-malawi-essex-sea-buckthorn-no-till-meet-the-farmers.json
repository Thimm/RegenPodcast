Then we are back in the garden of England talking to an Essex farmer about his experiments growing Sea Buckthorn and how he and his son are dealing with the ever encroaching sea chipping away at their farmland. We talk no-till and have the first of several reports from our visit to the Soil Hack gathering.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 25 Jun 2017 17:48:55 +0000", "duration": "00:35:18", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000230539141-vh9uhl-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-23", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/330044792-farmerama-radio-farmerama-23.mp3", "size": "33899414", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

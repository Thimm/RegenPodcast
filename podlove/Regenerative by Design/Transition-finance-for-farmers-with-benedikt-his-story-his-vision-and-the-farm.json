Furthermore, there is a limit to how much equity a farmer is able or willing to give away. <br /><br />That is why my co-host, aspiring to be regenerative farmer, Benedikt B\u00f6sel and I are interviewing leading practitioners in the regenerative agriculture and food finance space. They share their insights on how they would finance the speed up of the regenerative transition on Benedikt\u2019s 1000 hectares - almost 2500 acres- farm in Germany, one hour from Berlin.\u00a0 <br /><br />This is an open process. We don\u2019t have the answers yet, just a lot of questions, so please share with us any examples of transition finance you have seen, other inspiration, people to interview, etc...<br /><br />Find all interviews here:<br /><a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\"></a></p> <a href=\"https://www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show</a><p><b>Feedback, ideas, suggestions? </b><br />- Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a> <br />- Get in touch <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a><br /><br /><b>Join our newsletter</b> on <a href=\"http://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>! <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.gumroad.com/investinginregenag\">Support the show</a><br /><br /><b><em>Thanks for listening and sharing!</em></b>...</p>", "publicationDate": "Sat, 21 Dec 2019 17:00:03 +0100", "duration": "3737", "poster": "https://storage.buzzsprout.com/variants/7ltudpeuu9ap78kccfxksely0vtn/60854458c4d1acdf4e1c2f79c4137142d85d78e379bdafbd69bd34c85f5819ad.jpg", "link": "https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/transition-finance-series/", "audio": [{"url": "https://www.buzzsprout.com/1154870/4144685-transition-finance-for-farmers-with-benedikt-his-story-his-vision-and-the-farm.mp3", "size": "44879362", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Koen van Seijen"}]}

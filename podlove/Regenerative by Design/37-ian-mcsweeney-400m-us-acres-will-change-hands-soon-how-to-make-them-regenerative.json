The Agrarian Trust\u2019s mission is to support land access for the next generation of farmers. Supporting all stakeholders, from farmers and community members to activists and investors in this absolutely key process. The Agrarian Trust decided to work with the oldest organic and regenerative farms (with the best soils and ecosystems) of the country and focusses on getting the next generation of farmers on this land. These farms give the new farmers a head starts of a few decades as they are much more resilient to drought, pest infestations etc. are able to do so much more with so much less in terms of labor and time.Instead of focussing on getting new farmers on them on land with poor soil, poor infrastructure etc.\u00a0<br /><br />Some highlights of our conversation:</p><ul><li>Great wealth has been accumulated in this country through extractive industries. We need to collectively realise that the returns and wealth we got used to are based on extractive and exploitation.\u00a0</li><li>We need to get used to negative return, we need to return wealth to the soil, the ecosystems and communities we extracted for so long.\u00a0</li><li>We need to look at ways to compensate for sequestering carbon in soils.\u00a0</li><li>The prices of the leases of the Agrarian trust are directly connected to the soil building of the farmers.\u00a0</li></ul><p>Thank you Thomas Rippel for the introduction to Ian!<br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/08/21/ian-mcsweeney</a>.\u00a0<br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

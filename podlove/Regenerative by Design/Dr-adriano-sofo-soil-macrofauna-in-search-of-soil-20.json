Cited more than four thousand times, his research interests include plant-soil interactions, biogeochemistry, and environmental botany. With a passion for educating, he believes that information dissemination is the key to creating a more sustainable and regenerative agricultural landscape.</p> <p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=BYC9328AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">List of Dr. Adriano Sofo\u2019s Works</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li>Traditional agricultural practices that deplete soil organic matter and biodiversity (01:45)</li> <li>How Dr. Sofo defines minimum till (05:23)</li> <li>The band of soil that plays the greatest role in agronomy and the band of soil you don\u2019t want to disturb (07:04)</li> <li>Incorporating organic matter into the soil vs. leaving organic matter on the soil surface (10:07)</li> <li>Completely wet soil vs. wet soil surface: is there a difference in plant health?

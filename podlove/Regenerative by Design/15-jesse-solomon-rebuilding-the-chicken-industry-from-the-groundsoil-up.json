By focusing on raising slow-growing chickens entirely on pasture, with practices that create healthy soil and regenerate the land.\u00a0<br /><br />We luckily had time to discuss many things in the interview! How Jesse went from eating meat, to being a vegetarian (after reading the book Eating animals by Jonathan Safran Foer. To hunting his own meat and cook it for his family and friends and finally setting up an heritage chicken company.\u00a0<br /><br />Some more points we discussed:\u00a0</p><ul><li>Our current food industry is really good ad getting a lot of bad food to as many people as possible for the lowest price.</li><li>Organic was really good to teach people to look at labels, and now we need to teach them beyond the labels</li><li>You need them (the chickens) to be warriors in this system and agents of that healthy change</li><li>Half of what we do is rebuild the supply chain the other half is education</li></ul><p><br />Largest challenge for impact investors to get into the regenerative livestock space: <br /><em>their time horizon and return profile!</em><br /><br />We discussed transparency and how Emmer &amp; Co pioneers with showing the whole process, for instance through their Chicken experience.<br /><br />A question for you: who knows any models (selling different parts/crops of a regenerative agriculture farms) in the rest of the world, Europe etc.? <br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/07/21/jesse-solomon</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

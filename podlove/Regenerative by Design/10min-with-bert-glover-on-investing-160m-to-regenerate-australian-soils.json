If we can change their mindset from commodity based food to premium high quality nutrient dense food, clean food, slow food I think that&apos;s when we can really start to capture more change.</li></ul><p><br />All links and show notes:</p><p><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/05/17/bert-glover</a>. <br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

Mainly talking about their Australian projects where they use livestock to regenerate the soils. They had some tough first years of the fund (two of of the worst droughts ever recorded) but things seems to be going better now.\u00a0<br /><br />We also talked about the resistance innovators like SLM face when doing something different in a conservative sector like agriculture. Both from the farmers side as from the investors side, it takes a lot of courage (or necessity) to try something different.<br /><br />Some more points we touched in the interview:</p><ul><li>Regenerative Agriculture isn\u2019t spreadsheet agriculture</li><li>We are building a little village around each grass plant</li><li>Stress on animals is the biggest hidden cost on livestock\u00a0</li><li>Your investment, is based on biology\u00a0</li><li>Where does it (regenerative agriculture) fit in a portfolio, not connected to other asset classes, oil prices etc.</li><li>What role does regenerative agriculture play in your portfolio? Is it solid and stable enough for a decade or longer?</li></ul><p><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/02/07/tony-lovell</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

Dan started intercropping grains between his pecans before he knew it was called agroforestry, because it made sense to him at the time. The first part of the interview focuses on the business strategy of the farm. Whilst providing many tips and fascinating info, you'll also understand the context in which the agroforestry system sets itself. You will be able to understand the details of how he created and managed his intercropping operation, and follow the system whilst it gains maturity. Dan expresses some of his concerns with intercropping in more recent times, and when asked if he would do it again, he provides a surprising answer.

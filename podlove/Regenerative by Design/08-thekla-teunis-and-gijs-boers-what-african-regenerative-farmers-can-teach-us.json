Thekla Teunis and Gijs Boers, cofounders of Grounded\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br /><br />They are working to bring the agriculture sector in Africa back into balance. We luckily had time to cover many things in this podcast and to discuss how regenerative agriculture really works in practise on the ground in Southern Africa.\u00a0<br /><br />The key take-aways:</p><ul><li>Listening to farmers, (really really listen) they know what could work well on their land, even if they don\u2019t grow that mix of crops today because of circumstances forcing them to choose for short term solutions</li><li>It is essential to find the right local crop mix</li><li>When you are working with farmers and really listen, business cases will emerge, but you can&apos;t have a strict 10 year planning</li><li>There are huge opportunities in local processing in Africa, due to long distances to markets, challenging infrastructure, and it makes a lot of sense to process locally</li><li>Local processing makes it possible to pay farmers for Regenerative agriculture</li><li>And this offers many opportunities for (patient) Impact Investors</li></ul><p><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/04/29/thekla-teunis-gijs-boers</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

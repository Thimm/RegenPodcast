We hear how the Open Food Network works and one farmer tells us how they are using OFN to expand their business whilst reducing waste from surplus crops. We have some clever tips from Chagfood market garden about growing great veg on the wild exposed moors (and more generally growing great veg in the face of unpredictable British weather). And Plotgate CSA growers tell us about the human-scale tools they are crafting to support people caring for the land.", "publicationDate": "Sat, 25 Mar 2017 17:57:05 +0000", "duration": "00:32:37", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000214622222-hob5xs-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/farmerama-20", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/314431086-farmerama-radio-farmerama-20.mp3", "size": "31384599", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

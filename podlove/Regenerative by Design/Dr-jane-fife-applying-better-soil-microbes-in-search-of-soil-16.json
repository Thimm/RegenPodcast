With more than twenty years of applied research experience, she is a proven leader in research in agricultural application technologies, biologics, and precision agriculture. Her main points of interest include more targeted delivery of agricultural inputs for safer, more sustainably produced food.</p> <p>More on 3Bar Biologics: <a href=\"https://www.3barbiologics.com/\">https://www.3barbiologics.com/</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>WATCH FULL EPISODES</strong>\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/watchISOS\" title=\"YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS\">YouTube https://bit.ly/watchISOS</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Follow Diego <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter\">@diegofooter - https://www.instagram.com/diegofooter</a></span></p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>In this episode of In Search of Soil</strong></span></h2> <ul> <li>The limitations of applying biologicals to the seed coat and as a soil surface spray (02:00)</li> <li>Opening the spectrum of microbial biologicals by adjusting the time of application (05:10)</li> <li>Ohio State University and how 3Bar Biologics came to be (07:36)</li> <li>How difficult is it to culture beneficial microbes?

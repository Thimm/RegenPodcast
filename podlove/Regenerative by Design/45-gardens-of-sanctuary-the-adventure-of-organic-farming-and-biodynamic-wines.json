Then we head across the pond to Maine, where we tap into the knowledge of an organic farming legend and hear what has inspired him over his 50 years in farming. We hop over to Oregon to talk large scale biodynamic wine and we end with a few words of farewell from our resident market gardener. \n\nThanks to Rebel Kitchen for supporting this episode", "publicationDate": "Sun, 28 Apr 2019 19:24:00 +0000", "duration": "00:34:50", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000527176266-7zj1iu-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/45-gardens-of-sanctuary-the-adventure-of-organic-farming-and-biodynamic-wines", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/612760368-farmerama-radio-45-gardens-of-sanctuary-the-adventure-of-organic-farming-and-biodynamic-wines.mp3", "size": "50237693", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

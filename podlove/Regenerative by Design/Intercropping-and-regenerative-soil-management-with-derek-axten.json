This journey started in 2007 when Derek made a trip to Dakota Lakes Research Farm where he witnessed soil health and water infiltration levels beyond which he knew were possible. In subsequent trips to Dakota Lakes and visits to Gabe Brown\u2019s ranch, Derek learned soil and crop management principles which he\u2019s adapted to his own farm. In this episode, learn about the methods and systems Derek has applied and how they\u2019ve changed the trajectory of his farm from soil health and economic perspectives.\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Derek describes his system of inter-cropping and the management practices he employs to increase soil infiltration. He and John also discuss controlled traffic farming, Derek\u2019s liquid fertilizer regimen, and decreasing the use of applied nitrogen and other synthetic inputs.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to learn how Derek approaches:</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Soil management tactics and results\u00a0\u00a0</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water infiltration</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intercropping with two or more crops</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fertility applications and compost teas</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tillage</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Controlled traffic farming</span></li> </ul> <p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support For This Show<br /></strong>This show is brought to you by\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.advancingecoag.com/\" title=\"Regenerative agriculture products and services\">AEA</a>, helping professional growers make more money using regenerative agriculture since 2006.</p> <p>If you grow on a large scale and are looking to increase crop revenue and quality, email\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:hello@advancingecoag.com\">hello@advancingecoag.com</a>\u00a0or call\u00a0<a href=\"\">800-495-6603\u00a0</a>to be connected with a dedicated AEA crop consultant.</p> <p><strong>Sign Up For Email Updates<br /></strong>To be alerted via email when new episodes are released, and get special updates about John speaking, teaching, and podcast LIVE recordings, be sure\u00a0<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/drP495\">to sign up for The Regenerative Agriculture Podcast email list</a>.</p> <p><strong>Feedback & Booking<br /></strong>Please send your feedback, requests for topics or guests, or a booking request:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com\">production@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com</a></p> <p>Email John directly:\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:John@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com\">John@regenerativeagriculturepodcast.com</a></p> <p><strong>Credits<br /></strong>This episode was recorded by John Kempf and Derek Axten and produced by Nathan Harman, Robin Kitowski, and Anna Kempf.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve put together a survey; <a href=\"https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8db938e4-5cd5-4e6a-aba9-83c6da62fea9/us18-mailchimp-com-mctx-click\"> here\u2019s the link: advancingecoag.com/podcast</a>.

We wanted to say thank you to all of you, the Farmerama listeners and people out there doing the work to build a more ecological and just farming future for all of us. We know this isn\u2019t easy but we really appreciate you and it\u2019s an honor to all be in this together. May 2022 bring beauty to you all.\n\nWe\u2019re very grateful to those of you that support us and allow us to bring you these stories every month. Even the smallest contribution makes a big difference to us.

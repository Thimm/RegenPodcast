FoodShot is an ecosystem of world-class, mission aligned venture funds, banks, corporate strategic investors, and foundations that provide equity, debt, non-dilutive capital, and industry resources. Their first focus is on Soil 3.0.<br /><br />We discussed the following:\u00a0</p><ul><li>Flavour is a system, all the focus on genetics etc. went into yield and not into nutrients and flavour.\u00a0</li><li>It is hard to imagine any future that has 10b people eating healthy and sustainably of which soil is not part of that future\u00a0</li><li>Soil isn\u2019t only the nexus between agriculture and climate change but also between agriculture climate change and nutrition\u00a0</li><li>We have a pretty good understanding of what genes are but we don\u2019t know how they express themselves</li><li>Think of soil and a plant as a single organism</li><li>Ten/twenty/thirty years from now we will look more at nutrients per acre</li><li>We need a Global Soil Map with nutrient density</li><li>The brands of the future are the brands who understand their brand is their supply chain- Clean labels are key</li><li>Chemicals have for the most part made farmers not think about systemic things</li><li>We have to find markets for the cover crops, they need to turn into cash crops</li><li>The interesting near term work is being done in changing from a chemical farming system to an organic farming system\u00a0</li><li>From a data poor to a data rich farming system, looking at, below ground phenotyping, micro satellites, above ground Lidar</li></ul><p>A wish from Victor: How do we make the invisible more visible?<br /><br />If you are working on anything related to Soil 3.0 or know someone, more information on how to approach FoodShot and the conditions for grants and investments can be found here.<br /><br />Links and show notes:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2018/11/10/victor-friedberg</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

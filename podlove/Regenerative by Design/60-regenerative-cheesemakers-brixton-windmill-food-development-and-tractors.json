We give you a sneak peek at of one of the producers featured in our new series, Who Feeds Us?. We learn about a new course investigating the complex links between food and development, and finally we hear from a long-time farmer who has some clever tips on how to be resourceful with machinery.\n\nThis month\u2019s episode is supported by Treedom - a platform that makes it easy to support a farmer in Africa or South America to plant a tree. When you buy a tree with Treedom you\u2019re financing farmers to plant trees as part of small agroforestry systems, and providing the local know-how and support to ensure those trees have the best start in life and truly benefit the farmers, their communities and the soil. Once you buy a tree you can also follow its journey online. Since they started in 2010, Treedom have planted over a million trees. Let\u2019s green the planet.\n\nWebsite: go.treedom.net/rh5f\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/treedom_trees/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/treedomtrees/\nYoutube: www.youtube.com/channel/UC4LB9MIGsvGknvcSzA9Affg", "publicationDate": "Sun, 27 Sep 2020 18:59:23 +0000", "duration": "00:29:19", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-Tbd9G3rY8xtxPf6g-rCX21w-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/60-regenerative-cheesemakers-brixton-windmill-food-development-and-tractors", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/900574258-farmerama-radio-60-regenerative-cheesemakers-brixton-windmill-food-development-and-tractors.mp3", "size": "42289990", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

Stephen Briggs, managing Whitehall Farm in the UK, delves into the details of his apple intercropping system, and shows us how his farm operation has benefited from the positive interactions of his trees and his arable crops. He is convinced of the strategic benefits agroforestry provides, both for his business and agro-ecosystem. Needless to say, he also has made many mistakes, and shares with us what he would do differently. He finished off discussing where he believes agroforestry is heading in the next 10 years.

An ecosystem restoration company working to reforest hundreds of thousands of hectares. We discussed the technologies they are developing to drawdown as much co2 as possible! And their changing business model, from selling a tree planting tech to offering end to end reforestation services.<br /><br />Key points of the interview:<br /><br /></p><ul><li>Koen: trees are really fascinating organisms standing on a single place for centuries and having to cope with anything that goes by</li><li>Koen: It is really necessary to use trees to use forests to sequester carbon to to protect biodiversity to protect areas and soils and to hand them over in a better state to the next generation</li><li>Koen: I mean the science and the government are not going to do this. That is a too lengthy and too inefficient kind of process</li><li>Arnout: we really went from a product oriented company to an end to end reforestation company</li><li>Arnout: now our clients pay us for either for per hectare or per ton CO2 sequestered</li><li>Arnout: we are engaging in a process called data driven planting where we want to plant as much trees as possible in a planting season we want to do it at the lowest cost possible and at the lowest impact to nature</li><li>Koen: Scale is really important because you have to really build in a forest. So tens and hundreds of hectares are good at the end of the day you really need to restore landscapes catchments</li><li>Harrie: <b>you can eat CO2 credits</b></li><li>Arnout: each tree we have a G.P.S. lock so lat long which is unique for a tree</li><li>Arnout: I don&apos;t think the public can imagine what the impact is</li><li>Arnout: I think this (restoration) is becoming an industry</li></ul><p><br />Full show notes and links here:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2019/04/30/harrie-lovenstein-arnout-asjes-koen-kramer</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

Almost 30 years ago he started planting trees in the fields to encourage his laying hens to go and range. Since then, he has been busy planting trees throughout his supply chain. With about 70 farmers and 2 million birds supplying eggs to his company today, this is an example of agroforestry working at scale. The&nbsp;interview brings forward both practical&nbsp;considerations for the layout and maintenance of trees, and explains how they have managed to onboard their suppliers. David is enthusiastic about the numerous benefits trees have bought, carefully documented with various studies. He is convincd that there is a very clear case for integrating trees in all poultry production with very limited trade-offs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p>02:05 Story and overview of the company&nbsp;</p><p>04:08 Bringing trees onto the farm&nbsp;</p><p>10:14 Current design</p><p>12:16 Potential to add a perennial production?&nbsp;</p><p>16:51 Is it realistic to incorporate trees as part of the feed?&nbsp;</p><p>18:06 What does it mean practically for a poultry farmer to intergrate trees?&nbsp;</p><p>22:35 How are the tree plantations evolving?&nbsp;</p><p>27:12 Scaling tree plantations within their suppliers&nbsp;</p><p>30:58 Funding&nbsp;</p><p>34:34 Trees and animal welfare&nbsp;</p><p>37:00 Impact of tree planting on profitability.&nbsp;</p><p>39:49 Initial reluctance of some farmers&nbsp;</p><p>42:34 Is the agroforestry approach something that is valued by your customers?&nbsp;</p><p>44:18 the numerous&nbsp;&nbsp;benefits of planting trees</p><p>46:15 Do you see payment for ecosystem services as part of your model.&nbsp;</p><p>50:21 Supply chain requirements are driving change&nbsp;</p><p>54:52 Impact of tree planting on biodiversity&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\u2022 RESOURCES</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://lakesfreerange.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://lakesfreerange.co.uk/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lakesfreerange/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/lakesfreerange/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.farmtreestoair.ceh.ac.uk/ART\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.farmtreestoair.ceh.ac.uk/ART</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 GET IN TOUCH&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.regenerativeagroforestry.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.regenerativeagroforestry.org</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 SUPPORT US</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gumroad.com/regenagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.gumroad.com/regenagroforestry</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 FOLLOW US</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Regagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RegenerativeAgroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/regenerativeagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/regenerativeagroforestry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 FUNDING FOR EUROPEAN PROJECTS </strong><a href=\"https://explore.ecosia.org/regenerative-agriculture\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://explore.ecosia.org/regenerative-agriculture</a></p><br /><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

Also Michele shared how he influencing other wine companies in Italy and not &apos;just&apos; his 50 hectares in Tuscany. The wine industry has to reinvent itself and sustainability should be at its core.\u00a0<br /><br />Michele:</p><ul><li>&apos;More and more people are ready to put their sustainable values beside their other values (quality and price, service)&apos;</li><li>&apos;Biggest problem is: transparency of the sustainability certifications&apos;</li><li>&apos;Very fragmented distribution channels, distribution partners are not investing in it or pushing it (sustainability). &apos;</li><li>&apos;Less standards more solid standards&apos;</li></ul><p><br />Michele and his colleagues have set up a new solid sustainability standard in Italy to move the whole industry (and not just some niches) to sustainability. <br /><br />The next phase for Salcheto lies not on environmental sustainability but on social. <br />They introduced the first Welfare plan for vineyard employees in Italy. <br />They are hosting children of local schools at the vineyard and turning them into sustainability ambassadors.<br /><br /><br />Show notes and links:<br /><a href=\"https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/2017/09/06/michele-manelli</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />Please hit the share button if you think this interview is relevant for someone you know!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />For feedback, ideas, suggestions please contact us through Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/koenvanseijen\">@KoenvanSeijen</a>, or get in touch through the website <a href=\"https://www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/\">www.investinginregenerativeagriculture.com</a>. <br /><br />Join our newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.eepurl.com/cxU33P\">www.eepurl.com/cxU33P</a>.\u00a0<br /><br />The above references an opinion and is for information and educational purposes only.

They explain how cover crops can pay for themselves by decreasing the need for fertilizer applications while improving soils and yields in subsequent years.\u00a0</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listen to hear a broad array of perspectives on:\u00a0</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The benefits and drawbacks of various species and their best uses</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to determine your cover crop mix with your goals and budget in mind</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A comparison of simple one or two-species blends versus a diverse mix of cover crops</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The differences between cool- and warm-season legumes</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The value of cover crops in diffusing herbicide residue\u00a0</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The value of cover crops in managing carbon and nitrogen</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of bacterial and fungal inoculation</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The role of crop insurance programs\u00a0</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which cover crops can shift the soil\u2019s microbial population from bacterial to fungal dominance\u00a0</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which cover crops speed up the bioremediation process of pesticide residues in the soil profile</span></li> </ul> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This podcast serves as an invaluable resource for any grower whose planting window has passed without the ability to get in the field and for anyone considering the use of cover crops.</span></p> <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Community Impact Partner\u00a0</strong>for this episode is the <a href=\"http://nofasummerconference.org/2019-program/\">NOFA Summer Conference</a>, a three-day conference that offers a wide-range of seminars, workshops, and other educational opportunities.

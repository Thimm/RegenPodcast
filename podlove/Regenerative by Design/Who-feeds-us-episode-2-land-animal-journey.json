He says, \u201cTo acknowledge that each of us at the table will eventually be part of the meal is not just being \u2018realistic.\u2019 It is allowing the sacred to enter and accepting the sacramental aspect of our shaky temporary personal being.\u201d In this episode, we explore the ways in which a growing consciousness is developing around food, based on ideas of reverence, and gratitude.\n\nHow have the people who care for the animals that feed us \u2013 both in life and in death \u2013 changed during this time of crisis? How has the way they understand the future of food been altered by the pandemic, and their own responses to it? How do they see their own place in that future? Who Feeds Us? is a celebration of these key workers, a thank you and a call to action \u2013 so we don\u2019t forget just how \u2018key\u2019 they are.\n\nFeaturing:\nDean Wright: https://www.ballyliskofarmagh.com/\nMuhsen Hassanin: https://abrahamshalalmeat.com/\nJohn Martin Tulloch: https://www.tasteofshetland.com/producers/island-fish-shetland-ltd\n\nFarmerama.co\n\nProducer: Phil Smith\nExecutive Producers: Jo Barratt, Katie Revell, Abby Rose\nCommunity Collaborators: Zain Dada, Col Gordon, Fern Towers\nArtwork: Hannah Grace https://www.hgraceoc.com/\nMusic: Michael O'Neil\n\nProject Manager: Olivia Oldham\nPR & Comms: Fran Bailey, Kate Lam, Elma Glasgow, Nancy Brownlow\n\nWho Feeds Us? is possible thanks to the Farming the Future COVID Response Fund.

The East Neuk is a coastal region dotted with picturesque fishing villages and blessed with fertile volcanic soils. But \u2013 as is the case in much of the UK \u2013 very little of the food produced here is destined for direct local consumption. The Bowhouse is changing that by creating opportunities for local producers to reach customers, grow their businesses, and collaborate. We hear from founder Toby Anstruther, Market and Events Manager Rosie Jack, and some of the many producers who\u2019ve found a home at the Bowhouse.\n\nAt the end of the episode, we\u2019ll get an update from Rosie Jack on how the Bowhouse has been affected by the pandemic, and how it\u2019s adapted to ensure customers can still access local food \u2013 and that producers still have a route to market.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 31 May 2020 17:44:37 +0000", "duration": "00:45:36", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-Tbd9G3rY8xtxPf6g-rCX21w-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/56-the-bowhouse", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/831721612-farmerama-radio-56-the-bowhouse.mp3", "size": "43788288", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

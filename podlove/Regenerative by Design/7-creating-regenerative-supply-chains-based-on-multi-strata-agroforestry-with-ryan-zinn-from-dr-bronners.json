We explore with him how they are using multistrata agroforestry to transform their supply chains in order to increase their resilience and the improve the livelihood of the farmers they work with. We are able to understand why such a company is investing in regenerative agroforestry and what it takes for them to transform their supply chains. We go into some practical details such as the challenges that come with diversifying production on smallholdings and the key role of infrastructure to make it work. If you want to understand how forward thinking companies can be partners for driving forward agroforestry or if you're just curious to understand some of the stakes of agroforestry in the context of smallholders in the tropics, this episode is for you! </p><p><strong>\u2022 TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p>00:02:25 Introduction of Dr Bronner and their work with agroforestry</p><p>00:09:20 Scale and types of designs on the ground</p><p>00:16:27 How Dr Bronner works with farmers from their supply chain</p><p>00:24:07 Building regenerative techniques with the farmers</p><p>00:31:15 Dealing with extra labour induced by complex systems </p><p>00:37:29 Selling and working with diversity </p><p>00:46:49 Infrastructure for success and scaling</p><p>00:56:34 Mistakes and lessons learnt</p><p>01:05:48 How far is Dr B in the process of integrating regenerative practices in its supply chain?  </p><p>01:09:10 Regenerative Organic Certification</p><p>01:16:39 Will other companies follow? </p><p><strong>\u2022 RESOURCES</strong></p><p><span class=\"ql-cursor\">\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff</span><a href=\"https://www.drbronner.com/about/our-earth/combatting-climate-change-on-the-ground/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.drbronner.com/about/our-earth/combatting-climate-change-on-the-ground/</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 GET IN TOUCH&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.regenerativeagroforestry.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.regenerativeagroforestry.org</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 SUPPORT US</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gumroad.com/regenagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.gumroad.com/regenagroforestry</a></p><p><strong>\u2022 FOLLOW US</strong>&nbsp;on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Regagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RegenerativeAgroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/regenerativeagroforestry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/regenerativeagroforestry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><br /><hr /><p style=\"color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;\"> Hosted on Acast.

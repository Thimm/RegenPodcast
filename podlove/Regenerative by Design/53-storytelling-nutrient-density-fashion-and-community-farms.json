This year, we were delighted to be the ORFC\u2019s official media partner. So, fresh from the conference, we hear about the role of myth-making and storytelling in building the regenerative farming movement and we learn about a new initiative to put nutrient density at the heart of good food and farming. Then, we hear from a young fashion designer about her innovative accessory collections re-awakening our connections between fashion and farming. And we have an urgent call for councils across the UK to recognise the value of real farming.", "publicationDate": "Sun, 23 Feb 2020 17:21:01 +0000", "duration": "00:35:13", "poster": "https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-yRyrdNcIvuDZkjFb-AnhSIw-t3000x3000.jpg", "link": "https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms", "audio": [{"url": "https://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/765311032-farmerama-radio-53-storytelling-nutrient-density-fashion-and-community-farms.mp3", "size": "50781876", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": [{"name": "Farmerama"}]}

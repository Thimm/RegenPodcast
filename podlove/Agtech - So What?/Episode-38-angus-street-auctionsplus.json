Comes to you live from the Sydney AgTech Meetup. Sarah Nolet hosts a conversation with Auctions Plus CEO Angus Street. </p>\n<p>It's one of the Top 10 websites visited every day by rural Australians, AuctionsPlus has used simple technology to redefine livestock trading.</p>\n<p>Founded in 1986, its fair to say AuctionsPlus has been well tested in the market and has seen some changes over that time in the AgTech and startup scene in Australia. Remaining a privately held company, Auctions Plus is now facilitating more than $630 million worth of livestock sales annually. In July 2018 AuctionsPlus appointed Angus Street as their new CEO. Having worked within the organisation as the Sales Manager he knows every inch of the business and it shows in this conversation with Sarah Nolet. </p>\n<p>The Startup Phase is gruelling and AuctionsPlus has experienced exponential growth due to as Angus describes it 'the perfect spot where the value proposition met market conditions'. Now that they enter the next phase of growth how does the organisation navigate the changes. How do they keep culture in tact, and the agility to continue to innovate? 'No way in hell are we going to be corporatised' is Angus's response!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/NSW-Agtech-Meetup-Sydney/\">More about the Sydney AgTech Meetup group</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://auctionsplus.com.au/\">More about AuctionsPlus here</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/angus_street\">Follow Angus Street on Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angus-street/?originalSubdomain=au\">Connect with Angus on LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/auctionsplus\">Follow AuctionsPlus on Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/auctionsplus/?originalSubdomain=au\">Follow AuctionsPlus on LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>", "publicationDate": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 12:02:49 +0000", "duration": "00:25:55", "poster": "https://feeds.backtracks.fm/feeds/series/a19b8b0e-6913-11ec-800c-0e4caa76571f/episodes/65bd9854-6a97-11ec-a502-0e1130976a5f/images/main.png?1669665053240", "link": "https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=357322", "audio": [{"url": "https://backtracks.fm/tenacious/pr/65b8ac04-6a97-11ec-a502-0e1130976a5f/357322.mp3?s=1&sd=1&u=1640995909", "size": "25177937", "title": "MP3 Audio (mp3)", "mimeType": "audio/mpeg"}], "contributors": null}

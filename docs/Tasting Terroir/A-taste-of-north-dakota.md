**0:00:00-0:00:21:**  Life is busy and in a pinch pasta is like a go-to for us. And I know that it is for  
**0:00:21-0:00:27:**  a lot of families, but what makes our pasta different is that we're using two ingredients.  
**0:00:27-0:00:35:**  We are stonemilling wheat into full nutrition flour, so nothing is sifted. We have all the  
**0:00:35-0:00:38:**  nutrients that are in the grain are in the stonemilled flour.  
**0:00:38-0:00:39:**  So it's whole wheat?  
**0:00:39-0:00:47:**  Yes. It's a whole wheat, but a true whole wheat. So nothing is extracted, which is exciting.  
**0:00:47-0:00:53:**  And what was important to me was that it was whole nutrition flour being used in the pasta  
**0:00:53-0:00:57:**  and water. Those two things. I don't use egg.  
**0:00:57-0:01:02:**  Well then that really lets people taste the wheat. It's not just wine that has terroir  
**0:01:02-0:01:08:**  that has this place-based taste because the minerals that go into food affect its taste.  
**0:01:08-0:01:13:**  And especially in a system like yours, where there's such a focus on enhancing the soil.  
**0:01:13-0:01:17:**  So there are more minerals and they are more available and they get into the food more.  
**0:01:17-0:01:21:**  Then you can start to see where you can have taste differences based on the place it was  
**0:01:21-0:01:25:**  grown and how it was grown those two things together.  
**0:01:25-0:01:30:**  And so then with your pasta being so pure, it's just the wheat and the water, then people  
**0:01:30-0:01:34:**  will really get to start to taste the difference, like to taste North Dakota.  
**0:01:34-0:01:42:**  Right. And that's the idea, right? Is that there can be flavor, natural flavor that's  
**0:01:42-0:01:47:**  actually good for you.  
**0:01:47-0:01:52:**  Welcome back to our podcast, Tasting Terroir, a journey that helps you cut through the marketing  
**0:01:52-0:01:59:**  claims of quote, better for you food by understanding the link between healthy soil and the flavor  
**0:01:59-0:02:03:**  and health of your food. I'm your host, Sarah Harper.  
**0:02:03-0:02:08:**  That clip was from an interview I did with North Dakota farmer, Deanna Lazinski. In addition  
**0:02:08-0:02:14:**  to regenerating her land, Deanna and her husband have launched a food company, Guardian Grains,  
**0:02:14-0:02:19:**  which captures the flavor of the land she is restoring.  
**0:02:19-0:02:24:**  But it's not just better flavor that you get. It's a healthier pasta, thanks largely to  
**0:02:24-0:02:30:**  the way she processes the heirloom wheat she so carefully grows. You'll learn more about  
**0:02:30-0:02:34:**  that in my interview with Deanna coming right up.  
**0:02:34-0:02:38:**  As we have discussed in previous episodes, the healthier the soil, the more likely you  
**0:02:38-0:02:44:**  are to be able to taste some uniqueness from the place it was grown. To get a sense of  
**0:02:44-0:02:49:**  how a farmer and in this case, food maker is doing that. It's important to start with  
**0:02:49-0:02:54:**  how they define regenerative agriculture and how they put it into practice.  
**0:02:54-0:02:59:**  Hi Deanna, how are you?  
**0:02:59-0:03:06:**  Hi Sarah. Good to see you.  
**0:03:06-0:03:09:**  So let everybody know where you're farming at and what you're growing.  
**0:03:09-0:03:14:**  Well, my name is Deanna and I farm in central North Dakota with my husband, Kelly. We grow  
**0:03:14-0:03:23:**  a wide variety of small grains, yellow peas, flax, ancient grains, hard red spring wheat,  
**0:03:23-0:03:26:**  barley, oats. It's kind of a diverse mix.  
**0:03:26-0:03:31:**  Yeah. So tell everybody, what is your definition of regenerative agriculture?  
**0:03:31-0:03:39:**  It's really hard to pin down, isn't it? First, I just want to say that I think for us, it  
**0:03:39-0:03:48:**  has been an evolution of and a constant changing of our mindsets and our farming principles  
**0:03:48-0:03:53:**  and the practices. And the great thing about regenerative agriculture is it doesn't look  
**0:03:53-0:04:00:**  the same for me today as it did nine years ago, right? It's always evolving, which is  
**0:04:00-0:04:08:**  a great thing. Nine years ago, it started out as being a way for us to be more resilient  
**0:04:08-0:04:15:**  in our farming practices and help us kind of break free from some of the constraints  
**0:04:15-0:04:23:**  of a conventional no-till system. In the process, it has really changed into our focus is always  
**0:04:23-0:04:28:**  soil health, right? That has to come first for us, no matter what we're doing. So that  
**0:04:28-0:04:37:**  part has not changed. But as part of the system that we're farming in has changed is that  
**0:04:37-0:04:44:**  it had to spread further than our farm. The regeneration couldn't stop here. It has to  
**0:04:44-0:04:52:**  spread into the community, into the neighboring farms. And it really took a turn for us and  
**0:04:52-0:04:59:**  changed in the fact that we started considering different ways to offer our grains to consumers,  
**0:04:59-0:05:08:**  bakeries, businesses, and really help to close the loop. So people had transparency on where  
**0:05:08-0:05:13:**  their food was coming from and how it was grown. And it's really changed a lot. And  
**0:05:13-0:05:19:**  in this past year, my husband and I started Guardian Grains. And that had been initially  
**0:05:19-0:05:26:**  just to bring our grains to consumers. And that has evolved. And now we're offering stone-milled  
**0:05:26-0:05:33:**  flour and artisan pasta made with our grains. And I think that it was partly because we  
**0:05:33-0:05:38:**  wanted people to have access. And if people didn't know what to do with the kernels of  
**0:05:38-0:05:44:**  wheat, they certainly could be able to use flour or pasta, which are two very staple  
**0:05:44-0:05:48:**  things in our pantries, right? And so we just wanted to offer better.  
**0:05:48-0:05:56:**  Mm-hmm. So it seems like too that you're talking about process and mindset, but not a specific  
**0:05:56-0:06:01:**  set of practices. Like there's not like five things you do and you're regenerative.  
**0:06:01-0:06:07:**  Oh yes. Well, those kinds of don't change for us. So the number one thing on our farm  
**0:06:07-0:06:10:**  is we are in a no-till system, right? So-  
**0:06:10-0:06:14:**  Explain that for people that maybe don't understand tillage.  
**0:06:14-0:06:20:**  Sure. It's a more of a never till situation, right? So the equipment we use to seed our  
**0:06:20-0:06:28:**  crop has minimal amount of disturbance. And the idea of that is to protect the microbial  
**0:06:28-0:06:36:**  communities that we are relying upon to grow our grains and do it in a way that's natural  
**0:06:36-0:06:42:**  and that can offer the best nutrition in the crops we're growing. So number one, it's a  
**0:06:42-0:06:50:**  no-till system. Number two, we absolutely don't use any synthetic or organic fertilizers.  
**0:06:50-0:06:55:**  That's a little bit different than some of the other regenerative grain farms. In our  
**0:06:55-0:07:02:**  efforts to really focus on a natural system, we don't apply any sort of soil amendments,  
**0:07:02-0:07:10:**  no seed treatments, no fungicides, no insecticides, and no pre-harvest desiccant on our crops.  
**0:07:10-0:07:15:**  There are, so yeah, in a nutshell, that's pretty much how we're doing it.  
**0:07:15-0:07:19:**  Yeah. And that gets into that other question of how are you? So there's a definition and  
**0:07:19-0:07:23:**  then there's how are you doing it? And so you're doing all of those things, but the  
**0:07:23-0:07:27:**  regenerative nature of the community that you're with and the transparency piece, being  
**0:07:27-0:07:34:**  part of that, bringing people back into understanding where the food comes from and how to discern  
**0:07:34-0:07:39:**  the health of food. So maybe talk a little bit more about that, especially as you're  
**0:07:39-0:07:44:**  practicing it in putting together this, you know, this company that's not only doing flower  
**0:07:44-0:07:46:**  now, but pasta.  
**0:07:46-0:07:52:**  For a lot of years, we focused on the regeneration of the soil on our farm, and it was just a  
**0:07:52-0:08:01:**  natural progression for it to expand and spread out into the community. And I think that by  
**0:08:01-0:08:07:**  offering people that there wasn't really an option for, you can get organic grain and  
**0:08:07-0:08:12:**  you can get conventional grain, but there really was not an option for grains grown  
**0:08:12-0:08:17:**  regeneratively in a natural system. And I think that that was what was so important  
**0:08:17-0:08:25:**  to us was to be able to offer something that people didn't have easy access to. And that  
**0:08:25-0:08:30:**  started just with a conversation between my husband and I on how we could do better to  
**0:08:30-0:08:38:**  offer these, our grains from the farm to consumers. And we had no intention on starting a flower  
**0:08:38-0:08:47:**  and pasta company. You and I have been talking for quite a while and it wasn't there. We  
**0:08:47-0:08:52:**  were just focusing on the grain. And like I said, as an evolution of the way that the  
**0:08:52-0:08:59:**  system has gone, it just became apparent that we needed to be offering more finished food  
**0:08:59-0:09:07:**  items. So the flower came into play and also pasta. And the pasta was important to me because  
**0:09:07-0:09:14:**  life is busy and in a pinch pasta is like a go-to for us. And I know that it is for  
**0:09:14-0:09:21:**  a lot of families, but what makes our pasta different is that we're using two ingredients.  
**0:09:21-0:09:28:**  We are stone milling wheat into full nutrition flour. So nothing is sifted. We have all the  
**0:09:28-0:09:33:**  nutrients that are in the grain are in the stone milled flour. It's whole wheat. Yes.  
**0:09:33-0:09:40:**  It's a whole wheat, but a true whole wheat. So nothing is extracted, which is exciting  
**0:09:40-0:09:47:**  and challenging. Right. And it still tastes good because it has to taste good. Of course  
**0:09:47-0:09:55:**  it has to hold up. It has to have the texture. And what was important to me was that it was  
**0:09:55-0:10:02:**  whole nutrition flour being used in the pasta and water. Those two things, I don't use egg,  
**0:10:02-0:10:09:**  which a lot of pastas do. I just wanted it to be a food option for everyone, no matter  
**0:10:09-0:10:15:**  what their eating practices are, whether they're vegan or vegetarian or omnivores, I wanted  
**0:10:15-0:10:20:**  everyone to be able to enjoy Guardian Grains pasta. And so that was why the two ingredients  
**0:10:20-0:10:22:**  of wheat and water were really important to me.  
**0:10:22-0:10:27:**  Well, then that really lets people taste the wheat. We've talked a little bit in our group  
**0:10:27-0:10:33:**  about that it's not just wine that has terroir, that has this place-based taste because the  
**0:10:33-0:10:40:**  minerals that go into food affect its taste. And especially in a system like yours, where  
**0:10:40-0:10:44:**  there's such a focus on enhancing the soil. So there are more minerals and they are more  
**0:10:44-0:10:49:**  available and they get into the food more. Then you can start to see where you can have  
**0:10:49-0:10:53:**  taste differences based on the place it was grown and how it was grown those two things  
**0:10:53-0:10:59:**  together. And so then with your pasta being so pure, it's just the wheat and the water,  
**0:10:59-0:11:03:**  then people will really get to start to taste the difference, like to taste North Dakota.  
**0:11:03-0:11:11:**  Right. And that's the idea, right? Is that there can be flavor, natural flavor that's  
**0:11:11-0:11:18:**  actually good for you. And I think that part of the pastas have gotten kind of a bad rap  
**0:11:18-0:11:25:**  and like people that are carb conscious and things like that will steer away from pasta,  
**0:11:25-0:11:32:**  rightfully so, because all of the brand has been extracted from that type of semolina  
**0:11:32-0:11:40:**  pasta. And there's no way for our bodies to recognize it. So when we consume regular blonde  
**0:11:40-0:11:46:**  pasta, right, it ends up our bodies are like, I don't know what to do with this. Let me  
**0:11:46-0:11:53:**  just set this on your hip forever. And it never leaves. The brand is a really important  
**0:11:53-0:11:59:**  part of the fiber being able to move the pasta through your system and for your body to be  
**0:11:59-0:12:04:**  able to absorb the nutrients. So it's, that was the other reason that I wanted it to be  
**0:12:04-0:12:09:**  whole nutrition. I didn't want anything extracted. I wanted our bodies to be able to recognize  
**0:12:09-0:12:15:**  it because I think that's part of the gluten problem in the, especially in the States is  
**0:12:15-0:12:20:**  that the processing between the growing practices and the processing, I think our bodies are  
**0:12:20-0:12:29:**  rejecting it. And so the idea of using our grains with minimal processing was the best  
**0:12:29-0:12:35:**  way to offer it and to a way that people can enjoy pasta and can enjoy bread again. Right.  
**0:12:35-0:12:37:**  And then back to that whole system. Cause one of the things that's been fascinating  
**0:12:37-0:12:42:**  to me to learn about this is that that fiber and those other pieces that often get taken  
**0:12:42-0:12:45:**  out of wheat when it's turned into flour, they turn, it turns out those are needed for  
**0:12:45-0:12:50:**  our gut bacteria. Like our gut bacteria eats that as well as it being good fiber to move  
**0:12:50-0:12:56:**  things along. Um, and so when that isn't there, they aren't fed and then inflammation and  
**0:12:56-0:13:00:**  you know, all sorts of, right. And eventually we lose part of that gut microbiome, right?  
**0:13:00-0:13:05:**  Because we're not feeding it, right. We're not eating it what it needs. And, and I think  
**0:13:05-0:13:11:**  that, like I said, I understand what, why there's an intolerance and the white people  
**0:13:11-0:13:16:**  are steering away from gluten and it's not necessary. And I was under the impression  
**0:13:16-0:13:21:**  that it was all modern wheat was a problem because that's kind of how it had been spelled  
**0:13:21-0:13:28:**  out to me. And so that's why we started growing ancient grains. We grew einkorn spelt, uh,  
**0:13:28-0:13:33:**  Rouge de Bardo is a hard red French wheat, which I absolutely love. And that is actually  
**0:13:33-0:13:40:**  the wheat that I use in the pasta, um, is the French heritage variety. Um, so I, we  
**0:13:40-0:13:46:**  started growing those heritage grains because I had heard that they were easier for, um,  
**0:13:46-0:13:51:**  people with gluten intolerances to be able to digest because of the lack of, because  
**0:13:51-0:13:57:**  they haven't been hybridized. And it turns out what's real. The really exciting part  
**0:13:57-0:14:03:**  is that we don't just have to grow ancient grains for, for people to be able to enjoy  
**0:14:03-0:14:10:**  it. So our modern weeds and flour, um, are just as digestible as the ancient grains,  
**0:14:10-0:14:15:**  which is such a huge piece of the puzzle and which is why it's so great to work with Jill,  
**0:14:15-0:14:19:**  right? Cause she's going to solve that and be like, give us the actual proof to be like  
**0:14:19-0:14:25:**  this. It's really not the gluten. That's the problem. It's how it's grown and how it's  
**0:14:25-0:14:32:**  processed. Right. And so I think that it's, it's a really exciting time to be in regenerative  
**0:14:32-0:14:38:**  agriculture. And like I said, um, for us, it was about transforming our farm and making  
**0:14:38-0:14:49:**  it less reliant upon outside entities. Right. Um, the amendments, it was a way to get freedom  
**0:14:49-0:14:55:**  from that. And we've done that and it's great. And then there's, that is, it is a huge relief  
**0:14:55-0:15:01:**  to not have to worry about the price of fertilizer when it's quadrupled. Yeah. Um, and not worry  
**0:15:01-0:15:07:**  about how we're going to grow a crop without it and not have to make those decisions. Um,  
**0:15:07-0:15:12:**  and there's a, there's a huge amount of freedom that we experienced by, by doing that. And  
**0:15:12-0:15:21:**  uh, also the listening to science talk about how synthetic fertilizers interrupt the soil  
**0:15:21-0:15:27:**  microbiome and the communication between the plant and the soil for it to be a fully resilient  
**0:15:27-0:15:28:**  plant. I mean, that's a huge,  
**0:15:28-0:15:33:**  Yeah. That's a crazy interesting topic. I mean, the actually plants are talking to each  
**0:15:33-0:15:37:**  other through their roots, to the chemicals, the signals that they're sending and, you  
**0:15:37-0:15:38:**  know,  
**0:15:38-0:15:41:**  Right. And that they're actually farming the microbes, right. And they're eating these  
**0:15:41-0:15:42:**  microbes and strip  
**0:15:42-0:15:45:**  Calling them to themselves. Yeah. Yeah.  
**0:15:45-0:15:50:**  Like, um, you know, that's amazing. I get goosebumps because it's really cool. Right.  
**0:15:50-0:15:55:**  Yeah. Find out that plants aren't, aren't vegetarians, right. That they're actually,  
**0:15:55-0:16:00:**  they're actually, um, not vegetarian, which is kind of cool. And I think the, that whole  
**0:16:00-0:16:05:**  process and keeping that at the forefront of everything we're doing is to make sure  
**0:16:05-0:16:10:**  that our microbial communities are fed through roots. And so the more plants that we can  
**0:16:10-0:16:16:**  get out there, the better our ecosystem is for the microbiology in the soil and the better  
**0:16:16-0:16:22:**  that is going to be to feed the plant, which also then will feed the animals and humans.  
**0:16:22-0:16:28:**  Right. So yeah, it's just become such a, such an amazing journey that we've been on to see  
**0:16:28-0:16:33:**  the difference and, and, and grow and evolve. And I think that's the important part of regenerative  
**0:16:33-0:16:38:**  agriculture is that it's changing all the time. And some people feel like that is kind  
**0:16:38-0:16:43:**  of the wild card. Like, well, we really got to get a, you know, get a handle on, on what  
**0:16:43-0:16:47:**  this is, but I think that's one of the great things about regenerative agriculture is that  
**0:16:47-0:16:54:**  it's always changing and then it's evolving. And I think that that's how nature is. That's  
**0:16:54-0:16:59:**  how nature is. That's how people are. That's how animals are. We are changing, we're evolving.  
**0:16:59-0:17:03:**  And I think that's really important part to keep in the regenerative agriculture circle.  
**0:17:03-0:17:10:**  Um, and so it's just a really fun time to be involved in the growing of food rather  
**0:17:10-0:17:15:**  than growing commodities. And that has been a huge mind shift for us also.  
**0:17:15-0:17:20:**  Yeah. All right. And this, so that this has all been great. And now that you've had a  
**0:17:20-0:17:24:**  chance to talk about it all, I'm going to have you try to just, it's hard. It's very  
**0:17:24-0:17:28:**  hard to boil it down to like one sentence and don't think you have to encompass everything  
**0:17:28-0:17:34:**  ever generated agriculture in this one sentence, but it's so big that it can be hard to take  
**0:17:34-0:17:39:**  it for people that don't know where you can go. Right. Exactly. So Deanna regenerative  
**0:17:39-0:17:49:**  agriculture is better food for people and animals. That's great. That's great. This  
**0:17:49-0:17:58:**  is great. No, no, it is. There's a million other things it does. Right. But we are boiling  
**0:17:58-0:18:04:**  it down to why it really matters. Why it really matters is because it offers better food for  
**0:18:04-0:18:10:**  people and animals. And that's, and I think the process of getting to that outcome is,  
**0:18:10-0:18:17:**  is that you're rejuvenating the soil and that that then enables you to create a better product.  
**0:18:17-0:18:25:**  Right. Absolutely. So it all starts. My t-shirt says soil will save us and I 100% believe  
**0:18:25-0:18:31:**  that and if we can protect it, then we have a chance to do better and offer people better.  
**0:18:31-0:18:36:**  You know, we don't need more of anything, just better. And I think that regenerative  
**0:18:36-0:18:43:**  agriculture checks those boxes when we're talking about, um, the, you know, minimizing  
**0:18:43-0:18:50:**  tillage, minimizing soil disturbance, minimizing your use of fertilizers and reducing all of  
**0:18:50-0:18:56:**  the, the chemicals and, and things like that. I think that they all check off boxes towards  
**0:18:56-0:19:02:**  better food. And I think that's really the goal. I mean it, and we get to repair the  
**0:19:02-0:19:09:**  earth, but the result is better food.  
**0:19:09-0:19:16:**  Listening to Deanna's story about making great tasting, healthier pasta. You might be wondering,  
**0:19:16-0:19:21:**  why is this such a rare thing? Why don't I find this option on my supermarket shelf after  
**0:19:21-0:19:27:**  a difficult three year journey to try to connect regenerative farmers like Deanna and Gail  
**0:19:27-0:19:32:**  Fuller and Derek Axton with mainstream food companies? I have some insights to share on  
**0:19:32-0:19:38:**  that topic. I launched an online community, Grounded Growth, which was dedicated to supporting  
**0:19:38-0:19:44:**  regenerative farmers as they tried to bring their food grown in healthier soil to market.  
**0:19:44-0:19:49:**  This past year, Grounded Growth merged into Jill Claperton's larger global food and farm  
**0:19:49-0:19:55:**  community where we are all now working together to help both understand and apply the science  
**0:19:55-0:20:01:**  behind improving soil health and to help those who are making regenerative food better able  
**0:20:01-0:20:07:**  to communicate the value they bring to the public. So why revisit the past? Well, if  
**0:20:07-0:20:12:**  you haven't had any experience or understanding of the supply chain that brings your food  
**0:20:12-0:20:17:**  from the field to your door, it can be hard to understand the real value that people like  
**0:20:17-0:20:22:**  Deanna Lazinski and Gail Fuller, Derek and Tana Saxton and many of the other folks in  
**0:20:22-0:20:28:**  our network are providing. The following clip is from a video I made two years ago explaining  
**0:20:28-0:20:34:**  why in my view, there isn't more real regenerative food on the market and what you can do about  
**0:20:34-0:20:40:**  changing that. See if you think if much has changed since then.  
**0:20:40-0:20:45:**  As the founder of a network of farmers and emerging food companies working together to  
**0:20:45-0:20:51:**  try to bring regenerative agriculture to market, I've lost count of how many flour mills I've  
**0:20:51-0:20:57:**  reached out to in the past two years. Big mills, small mills, specialty mills, you name  
**0:20:57-0:21:03:**  it. I thought they would be excited to work with our farmers and turn their regenerative  
**0:21:03-0:21:10:**  crops into flour that could be used as a regenerative ingredient in many different products. But  
**0:21:10-0:21:18:**  despite the many discussions, the answer always ended up being no. Why? Flour mills don't  
**0:21:18-0:21:26:**  like to change what they're doing, turns out, especially for a small order that they are  
**0:21:26-0:21:30:**  not guaranteed they'll be able to sell. So you see all those big food companies that  
**0:21:30-0:21:37:**  have been talking to you about regenerative and educating farmers and doing a lot of marketing.  
**0:21:37-0:21:41:**  Turns out they aren't doing a lot of buying and they aren't sending the signal to these  
**0:21:41-0:21:48:**  mills that they would buy regenerative if it were offered to them. The result is that  
**0:21:48-0:21:54:**  there is no incentive for flour millers or processors to create this separate regenerative  
**0:21:54-0:22:00:**  product, even though it could be superior to what they're already making, both in terms  
**0:22:00-0:22:07:**  of potential health benefits like more nutrients in the food and because the way it is grown  
**0:22:07-0:22:12:**  could actually help fight climate change. Two things that consumers consistently say  
**0:22:12-0:22:19:**  they want. So long as big food companies refuse to actually order regenerative products, the  
**0:22:19-0:22:25:**  mills that process crops into flour and to other ingredients won't take on regeneratively  
**0:22:25-0:22:31:**  grown ingredients. But as I have learned, you can't really expect the conventional food  
**0:22:31-0:22:39:**  system to aid in its own disruption. Because if the people willing to take it forward can't  
**0:22:39-0:22:46:**  count on some help from the rest of us, then certainly big food companies will know they  
**0:22:46-0:23:02:**  were right to just talk about regenerative instead of actually buying.

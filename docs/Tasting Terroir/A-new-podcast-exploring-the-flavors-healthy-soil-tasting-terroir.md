### Tasting Terroir  (Fri, 05 Aug 2022 16:00:00)
**0:00:00-0:00:07:**  How does the health of the soil affect the flavor of our food?  
**0:00:07-0:00:14:**  How do the farmers' choices, the weather, the soil microbiome that world underground  
**0:00:14-0:00:16:**  shape the taste of our food?  
**0:00:16-0:00:21:**  Who are the amazing people growing food in this regenerative way, and how can we taste  
**0:00:21-0:00:24:**  the difference that they make?  
**0:00:24-0:00:29:**  These and many other questions are what we explore in our podcast, Tasting Tarroir, a  
**0:00:29-0:00:34:**  journey into the connection between healthy soil and the flavor of food.  
**0:00:34-0:00:44:**  I'm your host, Sarah Harper.  
**0:00:44-0:00:49:**  We are super excited to launch this podcast focusing on the impact that soil health has  
**0:00:49-0:00:52:**  on the flavor and health of food.  
**0:00:52-0:00:57:**  We will launch our first full episode next week, so please subscribe to the podcast,  
**0:00:57-0:01:02:**  Tasting Tarroir, to be alerted when new weekly episodes are released.  
**0:01:02-0:01:06:**  In this preview trailer, we will share some clips from our first episode that explain  
**0:01:06-0:01:11:**  what we mean by our title, Tasting Tarroir, and the journey that we will all be taking  
**0:01:11-0:01:17:**  together to examine the connection between the health of the soil and the flavor and  
**0:01:17-0:01:19:**  health of our food.  
**0:01:19-0:01:24:**  We will also share a bit of background on your hosts, myself, Sarah Harper, and Dr.  
**0:01:24-0:01:29:**  Jill Claperton, as well as some information about how you can become part of our Better  
**0:01:29-0:01:31:**  Food tribe.  
**0:01:31-0:01:32:**  Let's go.  
**0:01:32-0:01:39:**  Our podcast is called Tasting Tarroir.  
**0:01:39-0:01:43:**  To taste is to experience something, to know it beyond just the academic.  
**0:01:43-0:01:48:**  And tarroir refers to the place where something is grown, the impact that the conditions of  
**0:01:48-0:01:54:**  a place have on its development, how it became what it is, the unique flavor of it.  
**0:01:54-0:02:00:**  As a plant physiologist and a soil scientist, what do you mean when we talk about tasting  
**0:02:00-0:02:02:**  tarroir beyond just wine?  
**0:02:02-0:02:06:**  The question for me was, can we taste?  
**0:02:06-0:02:10:**  Can we taste what we do with the soil?  
**0:02:10-0:02:12:**  Can we taste a healthy soil?  
**0:02:12-0:02:19:**  Can we tell, if I grew all the same varieties and, you know, five different soils side by  
**0:02:19-0:02:24:**  side that were all treated differently, could I taste the difference?  
**0:02:24-0:02:25:**  Wow.  
**0:02:25-0:02:31:**  Like, could I taste that I grew this plant in this way?  
**0:02:31-0:02:33:**  Could I taste that I grew this plant in this way?  
**0:02:33-0:02:42:**  I think the answer is yes.  
**0:02:42-0:02:44:**  Our podcast is called Tasting Tarroir.  
**0:02:44-0:02:49:**  We all need to talk about this, all the branches of science, because we've got a lot of nutritionists  
**0:02:49-0:02:55:**  working on, well, how nutritious is this food and how do we make this food more nutritious?  
**0:02:55-0:02:57:**  But they're missing this connection to the soil.  
**0:02:57-0:02:58:**  Right.  
**0:02:58-0:03:01:**  It's like, well, we'll add, we'll fortify.  
**0:03:01-0:03:04:**  So we'll fortify with these vitamins, we'll fortify with these minerals, we'll add this  
**0:03:04-0:03:05:**  and we'll add that.  
**0:03:05-0:03:12:**  And it's like, well, maybe if we just build our soils up and really make them healthy  
**0:03:12-0:03:16:**  and regenerate them all, we don't need to do all that fortifying because we'll actually  
**0:03:16-0:03:25:**  have food right from the soil that tastes good and is really good for you.  
**0:03:25-0:03:30:**  I know that beef grown on the East Coast tastes different from the beef grown in Kansas.  
**0:03:30-0:03:32:**  I know it does.  
**0:03:32-0:03:38:**  I know that the beef grown in Argentina tastes very different from the beef that I've eaten  
**0:03:38-0:03:39:**  in other places of the world.  
**0:03:39-0:03:44:**  Now, does that require it to be all the way grass-finished or does that even affectâ€¦?  
**0:03:44-0:03:46:**  Being grass-finished totally makes a difference.  
**0:03:46-0:03:49:**  I mean, it totally makes a difference.  
**0:03:49-0:03:55:**  And now we know from some of the work that's coming forward on multi-species pastures that  
**0:03:55-0:03:57:**  multi-species pastures also change things.  
**0:03:57-0:04:04:**  So we think about milk, for example, that if cows are fed multi-species pastures every  
**0:04:04-0:04:11:**  day that their milk quality changes, the quality of the fat changes, the color of the fat.  
**0:04:11-0:04:17:**  And that affects the smell of the milk, which also affects how delicious it is and how it  
**0:04:17-0:04:20:**  stimulates our taste buds and things like that.  
**0:04:20-0:04:23:**  And that's all based on the plants that we grew up with.  
**0:04:23-0:04:31:**  We know that if we feed dairy cattle too many brassicas or too many flax seeds or things  
**0:04:31-0:04:35:**  like that, then we start to have sort of sulfate flavors in the milk or we have nutty flavors  
**0:04:35-0:04:36:**  in the milk.  
**0:04:36-0:04:40:**  Once again, that's tasting the terroir.  
**0:04:40-0:04:42:**  You're tasting what you've been doing, your practice.  
**0:04:42-0:04:49:**  So we're adopting the term terroir a little bit to mean how we're actually growing things.  
**0:04:49-0:04:51:**  So can we taste practice?  
**0:04:51-0:04:53:**  Can we taste how we grew it?  
**0:04:53-0:04:55:**  Can we taste how we fed it?  
**0:04:55-0:05:04:**  Can we taste all these things that reflected in the ultimate outcome?  
**0:05:04-0:05:06:**  Quick background on me, Sarah Harper.  
**0:05:06-0:05:11:**  I'm a regenerative agriculture policy expert who has worked for over 20 years in the public,  
**0:05:11-0:05:17:**  nonprofit and private sectors on what is now called regenerative agriculture.  
**0:05:17-0:05:22:**  From my experiences working in the US Senate on agricultural and environmental policy to  
**0:05:22-0:05:28:**  building bridges between farmers and some environmentalists to doing consulting work  
**0:05:28-0:05:33:**  on corporate sustainability policy, I've had the opportunity to meet and learn from some  
**0:05:33-0:05:39:**  of the best farmers in the world who are focused on building up soil health and working with  
**0:05:39-0:05:43:**  nature rather than against her to do it.  
**0:05:43-0:05:48:**  Joining me as my cohost on this podcast is my dear friend and mentor, Dr. Jill Clapperton,  
**0:05:48-0:05:52:**  a soil health scientist and plant physiologist.  
**0:05:52-0:05:57:**  Through her company, Risotera, Jill provides expert advice to farmers around the world  
**0:05:57-0:06:00:**  to help regenerate their farm and pasture land.  
**0:06:00-0:06:05:**  She helps farmers understand and apply the science of using plants to solve soil health  
**0:06:05-0:06:12:**  problems, planting with purpose instead of depending only on artificial inputs.  
**0:06:12-0:06:16:**  She also measures the nutrient density of food and is researching the link between the  
**0:06:16-0:06:23:**  practices on the farm and the nutrient density of the food it creates over time.  
**0:06:23-0:06:30:**  All of this expertise is a great background to then dive into how these practices and  
**0:06:30-0:06:35:**  the place where food is grown affects its flavor.

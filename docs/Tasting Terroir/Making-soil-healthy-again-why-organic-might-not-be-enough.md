### Tasting Terroir  (Wed, 24 Aug 2022 22:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome back to our podcast Tasting Terroir, where we are on a journey to explore  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:20):**  the link between healthy soil and the flavor of your food.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:24):**  I'm your host, Sarah Harper.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:27):**  This week we discussed what we mean when we say tasting terroir.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:31):**  My co-host, Dr. Jill Klopertin, a soil scientist and plant physiologist, explained how the  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:37):**  flavor of food is connected to many factors, including most likely the way it was grown  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:43):**  and the health of the soil that the food was grown in.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:53](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:46):**  This week we dive into understanding what makes soil healthy and what it takes to restore  
**[0:00:53-0:00:56](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:53):**  unhealthy or depleted soil.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:00:56):**  To start, I'll give you an overview of the principles of regenerative agriculture, a  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:01):**  way of farming that restores and renews the health of the soil by working with nature  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:07):**  instead of against her.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:08):**  Finally, we will hear more from my interview with Dr. Jill Klopertin about a challenge  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:13):**  to soil health that is widely used in both conventional and organic farming systems,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:19):**  tillage or plowing up the land to plant a new crop, and how this practice compares to  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:25):**  using and applying chemicals.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:31):**  To understand what makes soil healthy or depleted, we need to first understand a concept called  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:38):**  the microbiome.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:39):**  Specifically, we're talking about the plant and soil microbiome, which makes up an entirely  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:45):**  different world living below the surface of the ground.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:49):**  As the North Carolina State University Plant-Soil Microbial Community Consortium puts it, the  
**[0:01:54-0:02:02](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:01:54):**  plant-soil microbiome is the dynamic community of microorganisms associated with plants and  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:02):**  soil.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:03):**  This community includes bacteria, archaea, and fungi, and has the potential for both  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:09):**  beneficial and harmful effects on plant growth and crop yield.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:13):**  The composition of any particular microbiome is influenced by a myriad of factors including  
**[0:02:19-0:02:30](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:19):**  environmental, soil, physical properties, nutrient availability, and plant species.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:34](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:30):**  If you are into health and nutrition, you may have heard how important gut health is  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:34):**  to the overall health of people.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:37):**  In our intestines, we have a microbiome that is host to many different organisms, which  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:42):**  are interdependent and can create healthy or unhealthy conditions for us, depending  
**[0:02:47-0:02:49](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:47):**  on a number of factors.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:49):**  This microbiome supports our immune system, our ability to fight off infection and stay  
**[0:02:55-0:02:56](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:55):**  healthy.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:02:56):**  The same principle is true for the microbiome that exists underground, where there are billions  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:02):**  of organisms, at least in healthy soil.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:06):**  These organisms play a number of roles, from breaking down and recycling old plant matter  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:10):**  to providing various forms of nutrition for plants and many other things.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:15):**  The microbiome can be different from one farm field to the next, let alone one state or  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:21):**  country to the next.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:23):**  One of the ways that scientists can evaluate the health of a particular piece of land is  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:28):**  by examining and even counting how many organisms or life are living in microbiomes by looking  
**[0:03:35-0:03:37](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:35):**  at it under microscopes.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:37):**  They also can measure how active that life is.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:41):**  For many different reasons that we're not going to go into right now, farmland can become  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:45):**  very depleted, meaning that it is not full of a lot of life underground.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:58](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:51):**  As a result, additional inputs, whether synthetic, man-made or natural, need to be added to help  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:03:58):**  the crop grow to meet its full potential.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:02):**  Regenerative agriculture is a term that describes the intentional process of restoring soil  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:07):**  health by using a set of natural principles and practices.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:12):**  There is no one checklist of practices that makes a farm regenerative.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:17):**  It's certainly not regenerative just because a farm added one new practice.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:22):**  This is because farming is so different from one place to the next.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:26):**  Regenerative refers to a systems approach, not just piece by piece.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:30):**  A certain practice that helps a crop grow sustainably in one place could be disastrous  
**[0:04:35-0:04:36](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:35):**  in another.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:36):**  Instead of judging regenerative by a checklist of practices, a better approach, in my opinion,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:45](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:42):**  is to know the mindset of the farmer.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:45):**  Is he or she focused on continuously improving?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:48):**  Do they have a curiosity about what's happening underground and how they can help it?  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:04:53):**  Do they see nature as the real powerful force and their role as helper or steward rather  
**[0:05:01-0:05:02](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:01):**  than conqueror?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:02):**  I know that sounds confusing.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:04):**  And how would you possibly know the mindset of your farmer when you often don't know where  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:08):**  your food came from?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:10):**  That's a whole other discussion, which we'll have later in this podcast.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:14):**  But don't worry, we're going to help you see regenerative agriculture or hear about it  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:20):**  through the stories of many regenerative farmers that Jill and I have gotten to know through  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:25):**  our online community, the Global Food and Farm Network.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:29):**  These farmers can explain what we mean by telling you what it is that they do and how  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:35):**  their mindset has changed over time.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:38):**  While there is no one checklist, there are five main principles that are widely agreed  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:42):**  on as defining what it means to be on the regenerative journey.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:47):**  First, regenerative farmers promote soil health by avoiding tillage, the process of plowing  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:53):**  up the land, clearing away the weeds ahead of planting a new crop.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:05:58):**  Second, regenerative farmers cover and protect the soil, creating something that they call  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:03):**  soil armor.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:05):**  This is created by residue from previous crops and cover crops, which are plants that are  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:10):**  not harvested but planted strictly to help build up the health of the soil.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:15):**  The armor that this plant residue creates protects the soil from the wind blowing away  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:21):**  and the rain being washed away.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:23):**  And it keeps the underground microbiome cooler than it otherwise would be.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:28):**  Third, regenerative farmers add biodiversity to the land.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:32):**  They do this through many different strategies like planting multi-species cover crops, again,  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:38):**  crops that are not harvested but are planted strictly to feed the soil microbiome and help  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:43):**  build soil structure.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:45):**  And by rotating crops strategically to help ensure that the soil is replenished and not  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:49):**  just mined continually for resources.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:59](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:52):**  Fourth, regenerative farmers have a goal to keep a living root underground all year round.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:06:59):**  This means that there is no time when the land is bare and nothing is growing because  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:03):**  the microbiome is fed through the roots of plants and it needs food all year long.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:09):**  Finally, regenerative farmers work to integrate grazing animals, livestock like cattle or  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:14):**  sheep to manage cover crops by eating them and to add natural fertilizer.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:20):**  These principles hold the key to understanding what brings flavor and health to food and  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:25):**  how you as a consumer can cut through the many marketing claims and actually find the  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:31):**  flavorful, healthy food you're looking for and the farmers that you want to be connected  
**[0:07:36-0:07:37](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:36):**  to.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:37):**  Okay, so you understand a bit more about regenerative agriculture, but how does that connect to  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:42):**  the flavor of food or its health?  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:45):**  Well, as we talked about last week, the practices used and the health of the soil that those  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:50):**  practices can create often leave a flavor mark, if you will, on the food.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:56):**  Remember the discussion about blueberries?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:07:59):**  But finding that mark is hard.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:01):**  One of the ways that you will be able to find it is by knowing the mindset and the practices  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:06):**  in the system of the farmer that's growing your food.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:10):**  We'll get to helping you do that in later episodes in the podcast.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:14):**  Understanding the impact of these principles can become a great way for you as a food consumer  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:20):**  to look for the things that may make a difference for you, both in the taste of your food and  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:25):**  in its health.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:27):**  Many of these things aren't widely marketed or you may think you're already finding them  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:31):**  in the marketing that exists.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:40](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:33):**  For example, many conscious food consumers buy only organic food, but they don't realize  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:40):**  that most organic farms, like their conventional counterparts, are depending on a practice  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:46):**  that can have significant impact on soil health, something called tillage.  
**[0:08:51-0:09:02](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:08:51):**  To get more insight on this, here's plant physiologist, Dr. Joan Claperton.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:05](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:02):**  Putting a plow in the soil is very disruptive.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:05):**  It really would be like tilling up a city because there's so much more diversity below  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:13):**  the ground than there is above ground.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:19):**  Along those lines, one of the topics I wanted you to just touch on and to introduce people  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:24):**  to is tillage and the disturbance of the soil.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:29):**  They may be familiar with, obviously, chemicals and organic and buying organics that they  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:33):**  don't have chemicals on their food, which is a perfectly lovely thing.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:38):**  But they're less familiar with the fact that chemicals aren't the only way that the microbiome,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:43):**  that world underground, is disturbed.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:46):**  Tillage for a long time is tilling up the field to clear away the weeds so that you  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:50):**  can start fresh with a crop, especially needed in organic because you're not using chemicals  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:55):**  to control the weeds.  
**[0:09:56-0:09:59](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:56):**  That has its own level of disruption.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:09:59):**  It's back to your point, I think, that it's all connected and there's no just one easy  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:03):**  button, no easy thing.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:06):**  Maybe explain to people the complexity of tillage.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:16](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:10):**  We're not saying tillage is always bad either because that goes the other extreme.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:16):**  But people don't understand that actually no-till farmers who are also regenerative,  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:22):**  which is a big caveat because just because you're no-till doesn't mean you're regenerative,  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:25):**  but no-till farmers who are also regenerative and have done all this work to build up their  
**[0:10:30-0:10:37](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:30):**  soil working with you and people like you to add the right kind of plants to help are  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:37):**  able to actually grow crops using small amounts of chemicals and not tilling that have no  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:42):**  pesticide residue on their crop at the end of the process and have all these benefits  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:48):**  of storing carbon in the ground, not disrupting the underlying community.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:53):**  So I know Duane Beck talks about it as sending an earthquake through these microbiome communities  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:10:59):**  every year, but maybe just share some of your thoughts about tillage and balancing all of  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:04):**  that with...  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:05):**  I've obviously taught you really well.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:07):**  No, I know.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:09):**  That was an excellent summary.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:22](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:13):**  You know, from a biological standpoint, which very much I think I identify myself with soil  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:22):**  health and looking at the living things in soil.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:28):**  It really is.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:34](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:30):**  Putting a plow in the soil is very disruptive.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:40](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:34):**  It really would be like tilling up a city because there's so much more diversity below  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:40):**  the ground than there is above ground.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:45](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:43):**  So you destroy all that habitat.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:45):**  You destroy the soil structure that they've been putting a lot of energy into building.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:51):**  And so now you've destroyed it all.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:55):**  The benefit we get from tillage is not...  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:11:58):**  This is the part that people don't understand.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:01):**  The benefit you get from tillage is because you killed everything.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:06):**  Because all the bacteria, not so much the bacteria, but all the fungi and all the soil  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:12):**  animals.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:13):**  So you really benefit from destroying all the soil animals.  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:18):**  The fungi and the bacteria will grow back because bacteria are really small.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:22):**  So you disrupt them a little bit.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:23):**  Okay, well, they'll deal with it.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:25):**  And the fungi, you disrupt their network and then they have to repair their networks, like  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:29):**  knitting it all up again.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:32):**  But the soil animals, you completely demolish them.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:38](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:36):**  And they're the predators.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:39](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:38):**  People don't know that there are soil animals.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:39):**  Tell them about that.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:40):**  There's so many soil animals, so many mites, so many phalemmella, so many nematodes.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:46):**  I mean, there's just so many things that live in there.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:49):**  Because if they didn't, then the bacteria would eat up all the nutrients and we'd never  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:54):**  have a plant.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:55):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:12:57):**  Because the bacteria and the fungi are so much faster at growing.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:04](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:01):**  And they need the same things that the plants need.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:04):**  So they start using up all the minerals and everything.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:06):**  And if we didn't have the protozoa going around and munching them, and if we didn't have other  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:13):**  things going around munching the protozoa and that whole predator-prey relationship,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:19):**  we wouldn't have nutrient cycling in the soil.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:22):**  And I learned that from all my friends that worked in soil fauna.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:27):**  I didn't understand.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:31):**  I personally didn't understand all the animals that were in there.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:33):**  I'd worked on earthworms, but they're really at the end of that whole cycle.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:38):**  There are all these tiny animals that live in there, all the mites and that, that I didn't  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:44):**  even know until I started working with Val B. and Peltier out of Canada in Ottawa, who  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:51):**  was this specialist in mites.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:59](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:54):**  And then when we started to do that, I started to realize that we'd been missing, we'd totally  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:13:59):**  been missing the predator-prey relationship in all this.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:02):**  And then I started to work with people who worked on nematodes.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:05):**  And we'd always been focusing on nematodes as this real problem because they cause root  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:09):**  knots and all these other diseases of roots.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:13):**  But what we forgot was that 80% of them prey on other things.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:16):**  And we're like, oh, wait a minute.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:20):**  And then there's fungi that prey on nematodes.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:23):**  And you're like, okay, we just did not get this whole predator-prey thing because the  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:28):**  whole recycling of the nutrients in the soil doesn't even work if we don't have predator-preys.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:33):**  And the animals, it's the animals that are totally destroyed by tillage, earthworms,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:47](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:39):**  mites, whole assemblages of soil animals are totally destroyed by tillage and we lose our  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:47):**  ability to recycle.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:49):**  Now having said that, we still need potatoes.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:54):**  We still need to eat carrots.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:55):**  We still need to eat beets.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:14:56):**  We still need to eat some root crops and we're not always going to grow them no-till.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:00):**  I mean, we have to dig them up somehow, onions, all of that.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:04):**  And they're all really good for us.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:06):**  But then, well, how do we mitigate that?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:09):**  The question becomes then is, I've done this, I've destroyed that.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:16](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:13):**  So how can I help everything come back together?  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:16):**  Well, the answer is grow a cover crop afterwards.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:23](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:20):**  So you're halfway through an onion field.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:23):**  Your drill should be following you.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:26):**  When you're halfway through harvesting onions or potatoes or carrots or any of those root  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:30):**  crops, your drill should be following you with that cover crop.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:34):**  And you should be reseeding the soil so that you don't lose any of it.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:38):**  Right away.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:39):**  Right away.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:43](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:40):**  And somebody said, but I got to do my healing and stuff.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:43):**  Well, fine, hill.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:45):**  And also companion crops.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:47):**  You can grow companions between the hills of potatoes.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:50):**  You can do it.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:51):**  There are plenty of people who do it very successfully and they see the benefit on the  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:15:56):**  lack of diseases and the increase of yield in their potatoes.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:00):**  I mean, we've actually shown yield, increases of yields of potatoes and sugar beets and  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:03):**  all these things when we have companions between the rows.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:09):**  But it's outside of comfort zone.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:13):**  And it's true.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:14):**  You need to learn how to do it.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:16):**  And that means you need to take time out to learn how to do it.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:21](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:19):**  And you will fail.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:22](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:21):**  Sometimes we fail.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:22):**  I mean, just as an example, I shared my failure.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:28](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:27):**  We fail sometimes.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:31](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:28):**  But it's not about quitting after you fail.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:31):**  I think that Brene Brown talks about this beautifully in her leadership books.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:36):**  It's about how you get up off the gladiator floor.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:52](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:43):**  It's about getting up and taking the first step back and going, okay, I fell on my face.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:52):**  Wash your face off.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:53):**  Dust yourself off.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:55):**  Stand back up and go, okay, how can I do this?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:16:59):**  And who do I go and talk to about how I can make this work?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:02):**  I think it has to be about how do I get back up off the gladiator floor?  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:08):**  The issue of tillage and the disruption it can cause to the microbiome is a good example  
**[0:17:13-0:17:21](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:13):**  of how our conventional understanding of things like factory farming or organic don't really  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:21):**  fit in this new regenerative mindset.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:25):**  Regenerative is beyond organic, and it's certainly not conventional.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:29):**  It's its own thing.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:31):**  And it just might be the key to finding the flavors that you enjoy that also happen to  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:37):**  be connected to healthier food and food grown in a way that's better for the planet.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:44):**  Next week, we will begin learning from some of these regenerative farmers, hearing about  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:50):**  how they define it, how they practice it, and how you might be able to buy food directly  
**[0:17:55-0:17:56](https://www.jillclapperton.com#t=0:17:55):**  from them.

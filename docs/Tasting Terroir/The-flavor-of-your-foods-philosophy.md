### Tasting Terroir  (Wed, 07 Sep 2022 22:00:00)
**0:00:00-0:00:18:**  You know, there's not a label on the shelf in the grocery store today that I see any  
**0:00:18-0:00:25:**  merit to, whether it's certified organic or grass finished or free range or local or whatever.  
**0:00:25-0:00:32:**  They all seem to have their issues, and so I just think if we're going to certify Regen,  
**0:00:32-0:00:35:**  I think we need to come out from a different angle.  
**0:00:35-0:00:43:**  I think for me personally, it's more about principles than it is practices.  
**0:00:43-0:00:48:**  Welcome back to our podcast, Tasting Terroir, a journey exploring the link between healthy  
**0:00:48-0:00:52:**  soil and the flavor and health of your food.  
**0:00:52-0:00:55:**  I'm your host, Sarah Harper.  
**0:00:55-0:01:00:**  That clip was from an interview I did with farmer Gail Fuller, owner of Circle 7 Farms  
**0:01:00-0:01:02:**  in Kansas.  
**0:01:02-0:01:09:**  Gail has been working hard to bring life back to a depleted piece of land and in the process,  
**0:01:09-0:01:14:**  bringing life back to the community that surrounds him and improving his own life as well.  
**0:01:14-0:01:19:**  You'll get to hear more of my full interview with Gail and his definition of regenerative  
**0:01:19-0:01:22:**  agriculture later in this episode.  
**0:01:22-0:01:27:**  Last week, we began the process of understanding regenerative agriculture through the eyes  
**0:01:27-0:01:33:**  of real farmers who are actually making better food by building healthier soil.  
**0:01:33-0:01:39:**  We started out with an interview with Tanis and Derek Axton of Saskatchewan, Canada.  
**0:01:39-0:01:43:**  While I believe these interviews with farmers are interesting in and of themselves, worth  
**0:01:43-0:01:48:**  listening to, I wanted to take a minute to explain how I believe their knowledge can  
**0:01:48-0:01:51:**  help you as a consumer.  
**0:01:51-0:01:56:**  If you have found your way to this podcast, chances are you care a lot about food, either  
**0:01:56-0:02:00:**  the flavor of it or the health of it or some combination of the two.  
**0:02:00-0:02:07:**  But let's face it, it is hard to cut through the many, often misleading marketing claims  
**0:02:07-0:02:12:**  that are being made about, quote, better for you food and in particular about regenerative  
**0:02:12-0:02:14:**  agriculture.  
**0:02:14-0:02:19:**  As you learn more about the core parts of making food ingredients healthier and full  
**0:02:19-0:02:25:**  of unique flavor from some truly great farmers in our network, you can use what you've learned  
**0:02:25-0:02:32:**  to evaluate the glossy promises made by the brands that you buy from.  
**0:02:32-0:02:36:**  You can put pressure on them to actually live up to the claims that they make.  
**0:02:36-0:02:43:**  But you can only do that if you have at least a bit of the insider's knowledge so that you  
**0:02:43-0:02:49:**  can see the difference between a natural fruit brand that ordered an unknown group of farm  
**0:02:49-0:02:54:**  members in their supply chain to add a cover crop.  
**0:02:54-0:03:00:**  The difference between that and, well, the farmers you'll get to meet on this show.  
**0:03:00-0:03:06:**  As a reminder, regenerative agriculture is a farming philosophy that describes a number  
**0:03:06-0:03:11:**  of soil health principles that farmers apply in different ways to help them restore depleted  
**0:03:11-0:03:18:**  farmland, bringing life back to the soil, and with it, often better flavor to your food.  
**0:03:18-0:03:23:**  These principles include things like reducing the disturbance to the microbiome by planting  
**0:03:23-0:03:29:**  crops without tillage, keeping the land protected by planting cover crops that prevent the land  
**0:03:29-0:03:35:**  from blowing or washing away, and adding a lot more biodiversity than is typically there  
**0:03:35-0:03:39:**  on a conventional farm.  
**0:03:39-0:03:45:**  For a longer discussion on this topic, please do listen to episode two in our podcast series,  
**0:03:45-0:03:48:**  Making Soil Healthy Again.  
**0:03:48-0:03:53:**  This episode is called The Flavor of Your Food's Philosophy.  
**0:03:53-0:03:57:**  As you'll see, if you're buying food directly from regenerative farmers or brands that work  
**0:03:57-0:04:03:**  directly with them, you are able to understand the holistic way of thinking that goes into  
**0:04:03-0:04:10:**  what and how they make your food, and this could be why it often tastes so much better.  
**0:04:10-0:04:14:**  Most food brands today know very little about the farmers who grow the main ingredients  
**0:04:14-0:04:19:**  in their product, let alone what goes into the decisions they make.  
**0:04:19-0:04:25:**  How are they picking the best flavors in their category if they don't even know what's possible?  
**0:04:25-0:04:31:**  Truth be told, most brands don't really want to know because it adds a level of complexity  
**0:04:31-0:04:33:**  that they'd just rather not deal with.  
**0:04:33-0:04:39:**  So instead, they highlight a few trendy practices or certifications that make it look like they  
**0:04:39-0:04:43:**  know more than they do about their ingredients.  
**0:04:43-0:04:50:**  Our ability to taste terroir, the place, the unique place of where food is grown, is linked  
**0:04:50-0:04:56:**  to the health of the soil, and as a result, to the ways of farming that restore life in  
**0:04:56-0:04:58:**  the soil.  
**0:04:58-0:05:01:**  That doesn't come from cramming in a few prescribed practices.  
**0:05:01-0:05:08:**  It arrives as an outcome of a restorative mindset that focuses on, as Gail puts it,  
**0:05:08-0:05:12:**  what to grow rather than what to kill.  
**0:05:12-0:05:17:**  This process of regenerating the soil can affect the flavor of food because over time,  
**0:05:17-0:05:23:**  healthy soil depends less, if at all, on the man-made inputs of fertilizer and pesticides  
**0:05:23-0:05:28:**  and is able to more fully reflect the unique nutrients and conditions of the place it has  
**0:05:28-0:05:30:**  grown in.  
**0:05:30-0:05:35:**  But taking a piece of land from depleted and artificial to full of natural life doesn't  
**0:05:35-0:05:36:**  happen overnight.  
**0:05:36-0:05:41:**  As we will hear more about from my interview with master farmer and member of our global  
**0:05:41-0:05:44:**  food and farm community, Gail Fuller.  
**0:05:44-0:05:49:**  From his transition away from conventional farming to his deep commitment to rebuilding  
**0:05:49-0:05:54:**  rural economies, Gail Fuller has a lot of wisdom and wit to share.  
**0:05:54-0:05:58:**  A quick internet search of his name brings you many great interviews and profiles of  
**0:05:58-0:06:02:**  how he has shifted his thinking about life as well as farming.  
**0:06:02-0:06:06:**  Check out the one done by farmer's footprint, for example.  
**0:06:06-0:06:12:**  In addition to selling his grass-fed and finished meat, Gail runs several events at his farm.  
**0:06:12-0:06:17:**  He represents one of the things that I have come to love about regenerative farmers.  
**0:06:17-0:06:22:**  Their reflective and humble nature and their understanding of just how interconnected the  
**0:06:22-0:06:33:**  farmer and the community are with a life in the land.  
**0:06:33-0:06:37:**  So let people know where you're farming and what you're farming, what your farm looks  
**0:06:37-0:06:38:**  like.  
**0:06:38-0:06:39:**  Sure.  
**0:06:39-0:06:42:**  The farm is located in Severy, Kansas.  
**0:06:42-0:06:49:**  We are one hour east of Wichita and we are on the very eastern edge of the Flint Hills.  
**0:06:49-0:06:56:**  We direct market grass-finished beef and lamb, pastured pork, chicken, eggs, and we have  
**0:06:56-0:07:00:**  ducks seasonally in the fall and winter.  
**0:07:00-0:07:10:**  We also have a couple of small orchards hoping to market peach, apple, pear, apricot, plum,  
**0:07:10-0:07:12:**  figs, cherries, etc.  
**0:07:12-0:07:16:**  But Mother Nature hasn't allowed that yet.  
**0:07:16-0:07:18:**  She has a vote.  
**0:07:18-0:07:24:**  Mother Nature, contrary to popular belief, Mother Nature has a vote.  
**0:07:24-0:07:29:**  Somebody said, you know, Mother Nature bats last and she's a bat right now.  
**0:07:29-0:07:31:**  All right.  
**0:07:31-0:07:37:**  Well, we're talking about regenerative agriculture on this Earth Day and excited to be able to  
**0:07:37-0:07:42:**  share some of the perspectives of folks that we're in contact with quite a bit in Jill  
**0:07:42-0:07:45:**  Claperton's Food and Farm Network.  
**0:07:45-0:07:50:**  And so, we'd love to get, as somebody who's gone from conventional to regenerative and  
**0:07:50-0:07:54:**  still on the journey, love to get your definition.  
**0:07:54-0:07:55:**  What is regenerative agriculture?  
**0:07:55-0:08:00:**  Well, first of all, you're correct, still on the journey.  
**0:08:00-0:08:05:**  I've been doing this for 20 plus years, but I feel like I'm still on the first grade.  
**0:08:05-0:08:08:**  So lost to learn.  
**0:08:08-0:08:13:**  It's interesting because it seems to be all the rage right now, everybody having to define,  
**0:08:13-0:08:17:**  verify, certify regenerative agriculture.  
**0:08:17-0:08:23:**  I was on a Facebook thread asking this question a year or so ago, and there was just tons  
**0:08:23-0:08:28:**  of answers about our muscular mycorrhizal fungi and soil biology and earthworms.  
**0:08:28-0:08:30:**  But for me, it's much bigger than that.  
**0:08:30-0:08:36:**  I think regenerative agriculture is about, first of all, it's just about regeneration  
**0:08:36-0:08:37:**  in general.  
**0:08:37-0:08:44:**  And I think for us in agriculture, it needs to be about regenerating our rural communities.  
**0:08:44-0:08:49:**  Obviously rural America is dying, and I think it's just as important while we're regenerating  
**0:08:49-0:08:55:**  our soils and our farms that this goes hand in hand with community regeneration.  
**0:08:55-0:09:01:**  And I think something for me personally that's really come to the forefront in the last six  
**0:09:01-0:09:08:**  to 12 months is also regenerating farmers.  
**0:09:08-0:09:14:**  I've put a lot of focus on my farm and my soil, and I've learned that I can change a  
**0:09:14-0:09:26:**  lot on my farm, but I didn't put enough focus and emphasis on me and realizing how broken  
**0:09:26-0:09:34:**  I was, I deal with depression, getting to be my age, the body starting to slow down.  
**0:09:34-0:09:42:**  I spent so many years dealing, handling pesticides and toxins, and not just that, but just living  
**0:09:42-0:09:45:**  in a toxic world of, it's always tough, it's always stressful.  
**0:09:45-0:09:52:**  And I've never done a really good job of dealing with all those stresses in my life, either  
**0:09:52-0:09:54:**  environmentally or personally or whatever.  
**0:09:54-0:10:02:**  So I've really put a big focus in the last year on regenerating me.  
**0:10:02-0:10:09:**  It's really come to light this winter, and I'm a long ways from being fixed.  
**0:10:09-0:10:14:**  I still deal with depression, I still have mental issues, I still need to get my diet  
**0:10:14-0:10:16:**  completely fixed.  
**0:10:16-0:10:22:**  I'm a work in progress just like my farm, but the more I've really focused on the spiritual  
**0:10:22-0:10:32:**  and the mental side of me and my farm, it's made managing my farm a lot easier.  
**0:10:32-0:10:35:**  Why would I want to do something to my farm that's damaging to it?  
**0:10:35-0:10:36:**  It's the same as I do with me.  
**0:10:36-0:10:41:**  Why would I want to do something to me that causes stress or inflammation?  
**0:10:41-0:10:47:**  And it really makes it easier for me to look at my farm in a spiritual sense, makes me  
**0:10:47-0:10:53:**  realize where Mother Nature is doing just fine and I just need to leave her alone or  
**0:10:53-0:10:57:**  where there's a place I can step in and maybe help alleviate some of the stress from Mother  
**0:10:57-0:11:00:**  Nature and help my farm to flourish.  
**0:11:00-0:11:07:**  So it's been a really change of journey for me, putting the focus on me instead of on  
**0:11:07-0:11:10:**  my soil, but I think it all goes hand in hand.  
**0:11:10-0:11:15:**  Well, and in some of the conversations I'm having with folks in our network for this,  
**0:11:15-0:11:20:**  the thing that keeps coming up, continuous journey and philosophy, that it's a philosophy,  
**0:11:20-0:11:23:**  it's a mindset, it's not a checklist.  
**0:11:23-0:11:28:**  And I just love for you to say more about, I mean, there seems to be such a human need,  
**0:11:28-0:11:31:**  a consumer need to like, well, what is it?  
**0:11:31-0:11:32:**  Where's the box?  
**0:11:32-0:11:37:**  And if it's not in it, and then there are all sorts of competitive needs, both with  
**0:11:37-0:11:43:**  the organic industry that has a niche and wants to keep it or enhance it and other brands  
**0:11:43-0:11:45:**  that want to move into it.  
**0:11:45-0:11:49:**  And so there is all of this focus on what it is.  
**0:11:49-0:11:54:**  And yet the most of the people that have done it that I am most impressed by, and I've been  
**0:11:54-0:11:59:**  working on this off and on for 20 years in different ways on the policy side, the people  
**0:11:59-0:12:05:**  that I'm most impressed with consistently, but that have outcomes that are really impressive  
**0:12:05-0:12:06:**  all come back to this.  
**0:12:06-0:12:08:**  It's almost undefinable.  
**0:12:08-0:12:12:**  It's almost like the act of defining it ruins it.  
**0:12:12-0:12:14:**  No, and I get it.  
**0:12:14-0:12:18:**  I'm not opposed to verification or certification.  
**0:12:18-0:12:24:**  My big concern is we tend to always come at things the way we've always came at things.  
**0:12:24-0:12:28:**  There's not a label on the shelf in the grocery store today that I see any merit to, whether  
**0:12:28-0:12:35:**  it's certified organic or grass finished or free range or local or whatever.  
**0:12:35-0:12:37:**  They all seem to have their issues.  
**0:12:37-0:12:44:**  And so I just think if we're going to certify regen, I think we need to come out from a  
**0:12:44-0:12:46:**  different angle.  
**0:12:46-0:12:51:**  And I think for me personally, it's more about principles than it is practices.  
**0:12:51-0:12:59:**  Sure, I would love to outlaw tillage and Roundup and GMOs and pesticides and all these things,  
**0:12:59-0:13:04:**  but I also understand there's processes and steps and we have to meet people in their  
**0:13:04-0:13:05:**  place.  
**0:13:05-0:13:10:**  We've got a really good friend that grows potatoes and for now he's having to do with  
**0:13:10-0:13:15:**  lots of tillage, yet his soil is fantastic because he's put an emphasis on that.  
**0:13:15-0:13:20:**  So we just have to be careful setting rules for farmers or anybody.  
**0:13:20-0:13:23:**  So for me, it's more about the principles.  
**0:13:23-0:13:28:**  Obviously I'll follow the five principles of soil health, but I think those are great  
**0:13:28-0:13:29:**  for soil health.  
**0:13:29-0:13:39:**  But I think for regen, I follow a set of principles that's more like wellness, environmental stewardship,  
**0:13:39-0:13:40:**  social justice.  
**0:13:40-0:13:45:**  Those are the questions that I ask myself when I make a management decision for me personally  
**0:13:45-0:13:49:**  or for the farm is, how many of these boxes am I checking?  
**0:13:49-0:13:52:**  Community resilience and things like that.  
**0:13:52-0:13:59:**  So I want it to be bigger than that because I really want it to be inclusive to all things  
**0:13:59-0:14:04:**  and understanding that I can follow the principles of soil health, but I can still damage my  
**0:14:04-0:14:05:**  neighbor.  
**0:14:05-0:14:06:**  That's not a good thing.  
**0:14:06-0:14:12:**  I've got to be more inclusive of everybody in my neighborhood, in my community and my  
**0:14:12-0:14:16:**  customers when I'm making management practices or whatever.  
**0:14:16-0:14:20:**  The other fascinating thing to me is when you learn more about what's going on in healthy  
**0:14:20-0:14:26:**  soil and the amazing community that's there and the harmony that's happening and the plants  
**0:14:26-0:14:33:**  talking to each other through the chemicals they put out in their roots.  
**0:14:33-0:14:37:**  There is a real spiritual element to what's happening underground and what can happen  
**0:14:37-0:14:45:**  may be above ground, but we have to value it and not try to just clear it all out and  
**0:14:45-0:14:49:**  put back only what we think should be there because we don't always know which thing should  
**0:14:49-0:14:50:**  be there.  
**0:14:50-0:14:57:**  Absolutely, and humans have a really bad track record and especially men.  
**0:14:57-0:15:03:**  We have forever been the hunters and so our job we think is to conquer.  
**0:15:03-0:15:07:**  And I think I would hope by now that some of us are learning that there is no conquering  
**0:15:07-0:15:08:**  mother nature.  
**0:15:08-0:15:13:**  We can beat her for a while, but pretty soon she's going to beat us one way or the other.  
**0:15:13-0:15:20:**  And yeah, as we learn more and more on the scientific side of all of these things connecting  
**0:15:20-0:15:27:**  and communicating and not just plant to plant, but plant to animal and plant to insect and  
**0:15:27-0:15:34:**  fungi to insect and fungi to root and all these, it's like me talking to a tiger.  
**0:15:34-0:15:37:**  Who says all of this stuff isn't talking to me?  
**0:15:37-0:15:38:**  I'm too arrogant to listen.  
**0:15:38-0:15:45:**  And so that's kind of where I am right now is I'm trying to become a part of that ecosystem  
**0:15:45-0:15:50:**  and I'm trying to do more time sitting and listening to my farm that I am talking to  
**0:15:50-0:15:52:**  or talking at my farm or managing.  
**0:15:52-0:15:56:**  I'm trying to let it talk to me and I'm trying to learn how to listen.  
**0:15:56-0:16:00:**  And I don't know that language very well, but I certainly know a heck of a lot better  
**0:16:00-0:16:02:**  than I did 20 years ago.  
**0:16:02-0:16:06:**  And I think I've always been one to kind of get on farmers for not carrying the spade  
**0:16:06-0:16:07:**  with them.  
**0:16:07-0:16:08:**  And what's your soil look like?  
**0:16:08-0:16:10:**  Because most don't even know.  
**0:16:10-0:16:15:**  But I'm kind of getting to the point now in my journey that I can look at my soil without  
**0:16:15-0:16:19:**  a spade and tell you if it's healthy or not.  
**0:16:19-0:16:23:**  How many insects are crawling or flying above this particular patch?  
**0:16:23-0:16:24:**  How many birds are sitting there?  
**0:16:24-0:16:27:**  How many, you know, whatever.  
**0:16:27-0:16:31:**  If you're void of life above ground, you're probably void of life below ground.  
**0:16:31-0:16:38:**  I really love the connection that you've made to the mental health of the people and the  
**0:16:38-0:16:42:**  farm and also the rural regeneration piece.  
**0:16:42-0:16:47:**  It seems like regeneration is more than just any one thing.  
**0:16:47-0:16:48:**  It's this holistic.  
**0:16:48-0:16:50:**  It's like everything in the system is getting better.  
**0:16:50-0:16:55:**  And because one thing is getting better here than another thing, but it's not necessarily  
**0:16:55-0:17:00:**  I'm going to control here's the program and I'm going to improve this by 30%.  
**0:17:00-0:17:04:**  It's sort of like this improved and wow, that shot up 50% in that shot.  
**0:17:04-0:17:06:**  But you still can measure outcomes.  
**0:17:06-0:17:08:**  You can still see improvement.  
**0:17:08-0:17:10:**  You just can't always predict or shape it.  
**0:17:10-0:17:11:**  Maybe.  
**0:17:11-0:17:12:**  Yeah.  
**0:17:12-0:17:15:**  And I think that's probably a little bit of the struggle with man today is, you know,  
**0:17:15-0:17:17:**  we want to set outcomes.  
**0:17:17-0:17:20:**  You know, we want, we want you, you know, we're going to plant corn this year.  
**0:17:20-0:17:22:**  We want 300 bushel corn and that's an outcome.  
**0:17:22-0:17:28:**  And we don't think of an outcome as doubling our coil population this year or beaver showing  
**0:17:28-0:17:33:**  back up on the farm or anything outside of grain yield and dollars.  
**0:17:33-0:17:37:**  But, you know, I think we've got to learn to measure our outcomes differently.  
**0:17:37-0:17:40:**  And certainly it's got to come back to me.  
**0:17:40-0:17:42:**  Am I happier this year?  
**0:17:42-0:17:44:**  Am I, am I less stressed this year?  
**0:17:44-0:17:46:**  Am I sleeping well?  
**0:17:46-0:17:47:**  You know, do I love my life?  
**0:17:47-0:17:52:**  Do I love my life when I leave the farm as much as I love it when I go to the farm and  
**0:17:52-0:17:53:**  vice versa?  
**0:17:53-0:17:59:**  Because you know, having healthy soil is doing nobody any good if the farmer still goes home  
**0:17:59-0:18:03:**  and thinks about killing themselves at night or drinking themselves to sleep.  
**0:18:03-0:18:08:**  There's, you know, if that's the case, there's still a lot of tension and stress on that  
**0:18:08-0:18:09:**  farm.  
**0:18:09-0:18:14:**  So now I want to hear a little bit more about how you practice regenerative on your farm.  
**0:18:14-0:18:15:**  Share with us what that looks like.  
**0:18:15-0:18:16:**  Sure.  
**0:18:16-0:18:19:**  From a farm perspective or from a meat perspective?  
**0:18:19-0:18:22:**  Well both, because as we know, it's, it is both.  
**0:18:22-0:18:23:**  Sure.  
**0:18:23-0:18:28:**  So, you know, as most people know, I've relocated to a new farm a couple years ago.  
**0:18:28-0:18:31:**  So we're on a completely different journey now.  
**0:18:31-0:18:36:**  Back to square one with a dead soil, with a dead system.  
**0:18:36-0:18:42:**  If you're on my farm, your first thought would be, oh, this, this is a wildlife haven.  
**0:18:42-0:18:43:**  We've got a little bit of timber.  
**0:18:43-0:18:46:**  We've got some grassland that has a lot of diversity in it.  
**0:18:46-0:18:47:**  We've got several ponds.  
**0:18:47-0:18:49:**  We got a little bit of crop land.  
**0:18:49-0:18:53:**  And you would just think this would just be loaded with wildlife, but it's not.  
**0:18:53-0:18:54:**  We have very few squirrels.  
**0:18:54-0:18:56:**  We have very few deer.  
**0:18:56-0:18:57:**  We have no turkey.  
**0:18:57-0:18:58:**  We have no quail.  
**0:18:58-0:18:59:**  All of these things.  
**0:18:59-0:19:04:**  So, you know, and when you put a spade in the soil, that shows up.  
**0:19:04-0:19:08:**  So we're, you know, we're back to square one, but we know we can take all of our knowledge.  
**0:19:08-0:19:13:**  Our goal is to do in five years here what we did in 20 on our old farm with the soil  
**0:19:13-0:19:15:**  and the ecosystem.  
**0:19:15-0:19:20:**  We've already seen pretty good improvements in our infiltration rates.  
**0:19:20-0:19:26:**  We're doing, you know, our practices are holistic in general in that we do rotational grazing  
**0:19:26-0:19:29:**  with the sheep or with all of the animals.  
**0:19:29-0:19:33:**  The sheep and the cows sometimes run together, sometimes not.  
**0:19:33-0:19:38:**  We rotate them anywhere from once a day to seven or eight times a day.  
**0:19:38-0:19:44:**  In the wintertime, we'll relax that a little bit depending on our desire and management  
**0:19:44-0:19:45:**  goals.  
**0:19:45-0:19:49:**  And sometimes in the winter, they'll park in a given area for one to two weeks.  
**0:19:49-0:19:54:**  But with any time during the growing season, we're going pretty hard and fast.  
**0:19:54-0:19:55:**  The pigs get rotated too.  
**0:19:55-0:19:57:**  That's been a little bit of a slower process.  
**0:19:57-0:20:00:**  Pigs manage completely different than cows and sheep.  
**0:20:00-0:20:08:**  And we're all still learning the pigs and I on the best way to graze pigs.  
**0:20:08-0:20:11:**  So those are kind of some of the starts to chickens.  
**0:20:11-0:20:13:**  They're also a big part of the rotation.  
**0:20:13-0:20:16:**  They follow the sheep and the cows in the summer.  
**0:20:16-0:20:20:**  They are a big part of our insecticide program.  
**0:20:20-0:20:25:**  So we don't use, we use no inputs really on the farm as far as toxins, no herbicides,  
**0:20:25-0:20:32:**  pesticides, no, excuse me, no herbicides, no insecticides, no fungicides on the vegetables,  
**0:20:32-0:20:35:**  fruit, crops, grass, livestock, any of that.  
**0:20:35-0:20:38:**  So we're organic in that aspect.  
**0:20:38-0:20:44:**  I'm not saying we will never because if we come to a point where we have to spray something  
**0:20:44-0:20:48:**  or put an insecticide on a cow to save its life or to save the farm from bankruptcy for  
**0:20:48-0:20:52:**  a year, then that's probably going to have to happen.  
**0:20:52-0:20:57:**  We do so knowing that we make a bad move, but we do whatever we can to recover as fast  
**0:20:57-0:20:58:**  as we can.  
**0:20:58-0:21:03:**  For us, it's about animal impact because we're much more grazers now than we are farmers.  
**0:21:03-0:21:07:**  Our cropland, we're in the process where it's just strictly cover crops right now because  
**0:21:07-0:21:09:**  it's completely dead soil.  
**0:21:09-0:21:15:**  There's really little chance of growing much of a yielding crop, grain crop with it because  
**0:21:15-0:21:17:**  there's just no cycling going on.  
**0:21:17-0:21:20:**  So we're going to hit it really hard to cover crops for a couple of years, get the animal  
**0:21:20-0:21:22:**  impact.  
**0:21:22-0:21:26:**  And the goal for this year is to use it for winter grazing so we have some stockpile and  
**0:21:26-0:21:28:**  don't have to bring hay on the farm.  
**0:21:28-0:21:34:**  Well, that's so cool and then what about you, the personal side of regeneration?  
**0:21:34-0:21:38:**  That becomes the more difficult part because at the end of the day, I've still got payments  
**0:21:38-0:21:44:**  that are too high and stresses and things like that and weather is always a challenge.  
**0:21:44-0:21:49:**  You know, I'm a farmer, I'm trained as a farmer, so I'm trained to work 20 hours a day and  
**0:21:49-0:21:51:**  all of those things.  
**0:21:51-0:21:57:**  In my old life, I did a lot of that especially when I was a large-scale, 3,000-acre farm.  
**0:21:57-0:22:03:**  It was nothing to put in 100 or 120-hour week in the spring and the fall.  
**0:22:03-0:22:08:**  That has been hard to get away from for me because we just, for some reason, for some  
**0:22:08-0:22:15:**  really stupid reason, we let it creep into our brains that if we're awake, we have to  
**0:22:15-0:22:16:**  be at work.  
**0:22:16-0:22:21:**  That's just the way it's supposed to be and I've worked really hard to be a sunrise to  
**0:22:21-0:22:30:**  sunset guy and by sunset means I'm usually in bed by dark and I've learned to walk away.  
**0:22:30-0:22:35:**  I try to quit at five or six o'clock now in the evening even on the long days.  
**0:22:35-0:22:40:**  You know, Lynette and I are kind of running joke anymore as we walk in the house at five  
**0:22:40-0:22:44:**  o'clock or so and we look at each other and say, are you done?  
**0:22:44-0:22:50:**  And we'll say, no, we quit because we understand we're never done but we're trying to find  
**0:22:50-0:22:56:**  ways to make time for me personally and make time for me and Lynette also.  
**0:22:56-0:22:59:**  It's important to have both of those.  
**0:22:59-0:23:05:**  I've gotten so much better about, especially on a bad day when I'm a little grumpy or the  
**0:23:05-0:23:10:**  weather is ugly or things aren't going too great, just hop on the four-wheeler and go  
**0:23:10-0:23:13:**  out on the farm somewhere and shut the four-wheeler off and walk away from it.  
**0:23:13-0:23:17:**  Just leave the phone on the four-wheeler and just go out and sit down somewhere in a pasture  
**0:23:17-0:23:22:**  and sit underneath a tree or sit by a pond and just let it out.  
**0:23:22-0:23:27:**  Whether that's shouting in a tree or just sitting quietly and thinking or meditating  
**0:23:27-0:23:33:**  and trying to get all that stress and those bad thoughts out and try to soak in the beauty  
**0:23:33-0:23:37:**  of the farm, even on a bad hot windy dry day.  
**0:23:37-0:23:42:**  You can always find something beautiful on the farm and it's trying to find that appreciation  
**0:23:42-0:23:50:**  and that gratitude for really we're the luckiest people on earth to be farmers.  
**0:23:50-0:23:53:**  We've got to get that back.  
**0:23:53-0:23:56:**  Farming used to be a wonderful occupation and we've just turned it into almost like  
**0:23:56-0:23:59:**  a prison.  
**0:23:59-0:24:00:**  We've taken the fun out of it.  
**0:24:00-0:24:07:**  We've taken the neighborliness out of it and we've taken all of the joy out of it.  
**0:24:07-0:24:09:**  We've got to find a way to get that back.  
**0:24:09-0:24:10:**  I know it's going to take a while.  
**0:24:10-0:24:17:**  It's taken a while for me but just taking those first steps of putting the focus on  
**0:24:17-0:24:22:**  me and that sounds arrogant and it's not arrogant.  
**0:24:22-0:24:26:**  The focus should be on me because if I'm not healthy, there's no way my customers can be  
**0:24:26-0:24:27:**  healthy.  
**0:24:27-0:24:30:**  Well, and it's what you mean by the focus.  
**0:24:30-0:24:36:**  When you're talking about people like you that when you're working 20 hours a day, you're  
**0:24:36-0:24:44:**  not a selfish personality because if you were, you wouldn't be working 20 hours a day.  
**0:24:44-0:24:47:**  There's a difference between what you mean by focus.  
**0:24:47-0:24:52:**  If you're just focusing on how do I feel right now and how should I feel, that's different  
**0:24:52-0:25:01:**  than how can I process this stress and how can I not let these very real stresses tie  
**0:25:01-0:25:04:**  me down and how can I get better?  
**0:25:04-0:25:10:**  Just like how can I be part of the system instead of separate from it and feel like  
**0:25:10-0:25:14:**  the weight of it all is just on me which I'm sure I know a lot of farmers feel that.  
**0:25:14-0:25:19:**  Yeah, I think we all feel that regardless of how we farm or what size or anything and  
**0:25:19-0:25:22:**  a lot of it comes back to financial stress at the end of the day.  
**0:25:22-0:25:26:**  We feel like we have to work 20 hours a day to make a payment this month or get the crop  
**0:25:26-0:25:31:**  in in time and I think when we get to that point, maybe it's time to give the farm a  
**0:25:31-0:25:41:**  hard look because again, working 20 hours a day in hindsight now, I think that is selfish  
**0:25:41-0:25:46:**  because it's taking time away from your family, it's taking time away from yourself and where's  
**0:25:46-0:25:47:**  the joy in that?  
**0:25:47-0:25:49:**  Yeah, it's a good point.  
**0:25:49-0:25:56:**  It's a different kind of selfish because at least I think of selfish differently but  
**0:25:56-0:25:59:**  it's yeah, I can see your point.  
**0:25:59-0:26:04:**  No, I agree and I agree with your comment of obviously we're not selfish, we're working  
**0:26:04-0:26:10:**  20 hours a day but that's just the mindset that we have but it really I think is opposite  
**0:26:10-0:26:15:**  because we probably are being selfish if we work ourselves that hard.  
**0:26:15-0:26:21:**  Well, that goes to a number of regenerative farmers that I've been lucky enough to kind  
**0:26:21-0:26:22:**  of observe and learn from.  
**0:26:22-0:26:27:**  They end up, you know, it takes a while but they get to a point where they're able to  
**0:26:27-0:26:33:**  really make more money even if they have a little less yield because their expenses go  
**0:26:33-0:26:38:**  lower and then the system is taking care of itself and it's healthier and so there's maybe  
**0:26:38-0:26:43:**  a chance for higher price per whatever ton pound.  
**0:26:43-0:26:48:**  Once that system gets going, that virtuous cycle, it just kind of keeps building on itself  
**0:26:48-0:26:54:**  but it seems like that really hard point is to tip when you're at that point where your  
**0:26:54-0:26:58:**  land's been depleted and you've got the loans to pay and we're going to make this shift  
**0:26:58-0:27:02:**  and maybe and trust that yeah, a lot of other people have had good experience and we're  
**0:27:02-0:27:06:**  going to trust that my expenses will come down and that especially when there's just  
**0:27:06-0:27:12:**  such a, it just seems so foreign to think about reduced price, reduced expenses is just  
**0:27:12-0:27:16:**  as good or better than yield.  
**0:27:16-0:27:20:**  Yeah and I think those will kind of lead us back to full circle where we started this  
**0:27:20-0:27:25:**  conversation but I think you know obviously that transition is it's dangerous, it's scary,  
**0:27:25-0:27:31:**  it's extremely difficult and I think that's where it's extremely important that you have  
**0:27:31-0:27:33:**  a team.  
**0:27:33-0:27:39:**  That team obviously has to include your immediate family, your spouse, kids, parents but your  
**0:27:39-0:27:43:**  bankers got to be on that team, your agronomist has to be on that team and if they don't have  
**0:27:43-0:27:49:**  the same vision, first of all, you're going to have to fire some of them or get them on  
**0:27:49-0:27:54:**  your side or you're going to, you know, your stress level, your depression levels are going  
**0:27:54-0:28:00:**  to skyrocket if they aren't and then when you do get to that other side and you know  
**0:28:00-0:28:06:**  obviously the whole goal is to making farms more profitable with less stress, less physical  
**0:28:06-0:28:11:**  and mental stress and when you get to that point then the question has to become do I  
**0:28:11-0:28:17:**  need this much land because that's the whole goal for me of regenerating a community is  
**0:28:17-0:28:21:**  how do you regenerate a community is by having more farmers.  
**0:28:21-0:28:26:**  That's what builds a rural community is having, you know, if we double the farm population  
**0:28:26-0:28:29:**  you're now building a school in these small towns instead of consolidating schools and  
**0:28:29-0:28:33:**  you need a grocery store again and all these things because you suddenly have more kids  
**0:28:33-0:28:39:**  so you're now not just growing kids, you're growing buildings and business and all of  
**0:28:39-0:28:44:**  this so you know the farmers are going to start asking themselves how much land do I  
**0:28:44-0:28:50:**  need if I've increased my profitability 20% can I cut back 20% on my acres and allow another  
**0:28:50-0:28:55:**  farmer into the community and that goes against everything that we've been brainwashed with  
**0:28:55-0:28:59:**  for the last 50 to 75 years in rural America.  
**0:28:59-0:29:03:**  Oh that's fascinating.  
**0:29:03-0:29:08:**  How can people experience your farm or follow you on social media?  
**0:29:08-0:29:13:**  Do you have a blog or all these kind of things where they can learn more about your journey?  
**0:29:13-0:29:15:**  I don't blog.  
**0:29:15-0:29:16:**  I need to but I don't.  
**0:29:16-0:29:18:**  I do have Facebook.  
**0:29:18-0:29:23:**  I've got a personal page, Gail Fuller and a business page, Circle 7 by Fuller Farms.  
**0:29:23-0:29:25:**  I'm on LinkedIn.  
**0:29:25-0:29:31:**  I do have an Instagram account but I'm thinking of dropping that so those are ways and then  
**0:29:31-0:29:35:**  we another way to enjoy our farm is to come see us.  
**0:29:35-0:29:36:**  We have an Airbnb.  
**0:29:36-0:29:40:**  We have fields, you know, our annual field school that Jill helped co-found 11 years  
**0:29:40-0:29:45:**  ago and we have other on-farm dinners and things.  
**0:29:45-0:29:49:**  That's the best way just to come see us and hang out and soak it all in in person.  
**0:29:49-0:29:56:**  And do you do, you obviously do the sales of the meat directly to consumers but do you  
**0:29:56-0:30:01:**  do catering or events or other ways that people interact with your farm or are you thinking  
**0:30:01-0:30:04:**  about that in the future?  
**0:30:04-0:30:05:**  Yeah, we don't do catering.  
**0:30:05-0:30:07:**  We do on-farm dinners.  
**0:30:07-0:30:14:**  I love to cook but I would rather let a really high big-name chef come to my farm and make  
**0:30:14-0:30:19:**  dinner for me and a whole bunch of my friends and just have it like that.  
**0:30:19-0:30:22:**  So we do three or four of those a year.  
**0:30:22-0:30:28:**  They're a lot of fun and they're always different and it's a great way to, because to me food  
**0:30:28-0:30:30:**  is the great connector.  
**0:30:30-0:30:34:**  And when you attend one of our dinners and you know as America becomes more and more  
**0:30:34-0:30:39:**  stressed, it's been amazing at these dinners because we have 40 to 50 people show up, many  
**0:30:39-0:30:43:**  of them urban, not all.  
**0:30:43-0:30:47:**  Obviously there's going to be left and right and you know all walks of life and we sit  
**0:30:47-0:30:52:**  down for an hour and a half or two hours and there's no fistfights and there's cheers and  
**0:30:52-0:30:58:**  there are high fives and there's hugs and we let the, you know we just say screw the  
**0:30:58-0:30:59:**  rest of the world.  
**0:30:59-0:31:04:**  We're here enjoying a meal breaking bread together and there's just nothing like it.  
**0:31:04-0:31:06:**  So yeah we do that.  
**0:31:06-0:31:11:**  We do like all of our educational events, food is a focus.  
**0:31:11-0:31:16:**  We bring chefs to our field school and cook our meals and we talk about food and we celebrate  
**0:31:16-0:31:18:**  the food while we're being educated.  
**0:31:18-0:31:21:**  So we always make food a focus.  
**0:31:21-0:31:25:**  We are selling product in a couple of different restaurants.  
**0:31:25-0:31:30:**  Yeah and I think that's been a bit of a pet peeve of mine as we talk about regenerative  
**0:31:30-0:31:36:**  agriculture and obviously the big thing with most of us farmers now is nutrient density  
**0:31:36-0:31:42:**  and human health and we're trying to tie all that and you go to a so-called regen event  
**0:31:42-0:31:48:**  and they throw out a bunch of crap food at you and we've got to lead by example.  
**0:31:48-0:31:53:**  If we're going to be talking about human health, we've got to be leading by example and so  
**0:31:53-0:31:56:**  we're not perfect here.  
**0:31:56-0:32:03:**  We still have to buy some stuff that's not as clean as we want but we use all of our  
**0:32:03-0:32:07:**  food that we can and then we go to our neighbors and we source as much clean food from our  
**0:32:07-0:32:13:**  neighbors because that's what it's about is making them strong too financially and physically  
**0:32:13-0:32:19:**  and then but sometimes we still have to fill in some blank spots here and there with conventional  
**0:32:19-0:32:22:**  food yet but hopefully that changes soon.  
**0:32:22-0:32:27:**  Are you seeing a growing interest around Kansas where you're at?  
**0:32:27-0:32:35:**  I mean you're right there in the middle of big ag land but are you seeing interests and  
**0:32:35-0:32:40:**  people kind of being drawn to this path that you're on?  
**0:32:40-0:32:45:**  Yeah, patience is not my strong suit.  
**0:32:45-0:32:47:**  I'm sure that's shocking to you.  
**0:32:47-0:32:48:**  Mine either.  
**0:32:48-0:32:57:**  To me, this should have happened 10 years ago but it hasn't but yeah, it's growing.  
**0:32:57-0:33:02:**  I think the financial woes in agriculture the last few years has helped speed that up  
**0:33:02-0:33:09:**  but I've really been surprised as I talk more about quality of life and mental health that  
**0:33:09-0:33:16:**  really hits home a lot and I think that's going to be a big driver for farmers.  
**0:33:16-0:33:20:**  They can just make a living but live an easier life that's going to help sell them on this  
**0:33:20-0:33:25:**  I think but I think obviously sadly at the end of the day, it's still about money.  
**0:33:25-0:33:26:**  It's still about profit.  
**0:33:26-0:33:32:**  We still have to make payments and I think as soon as we can get the markets in place,  
**0:33:32-0:33:34:**  we can flip millions of acres.  
**0:33:34-0:33:39:**  I think there's just lots of farms waiting on that market to come into play and that's  
**0:33:39-0:33:41:**  something we've got to get sped up.  
**0:33:41-0:33:43:**  I think the demand is there on the coast.  
**0:33:43-0:33:47:**  We're seeing it or you wouldn't have all of these companies trying to find a way to buy  
**0:33:47-0:33:52:**  regenerative products but until we get those two completely connected, it's probably going  
**0:33:52-0:33:54:**  to be a little slower than I want to see it.  
**0:33:54-0:33:58:**  Well, the last thing I want to do is now we've talked about all of this and so it's got on  
**0:33:58-0:34:03:**  your brain but trying to kind of summarize it all down, I'm going to ask you to fill  
**0:34:03-0:34:08:**  in the sentence, regenerative agriculture is?  
**0:34:08-0:34:11:**  Regenerative agriculture is life.  
**0:34:11-0:34:12:**  Wow.  
**0:34:12-0:34:14:**  That's good.  
**0:34:14-0:34:16:**  That's good.  
**0:34:16-0:34:17:**  Yeah.  
**0:34:17-0:34:20:**  Restoring, rejuvenating, learning.  
**0:34:20-0:34:27:**  You know, I used to talk about when I started out of the conventional world and started  
**0:34:27-0:34:32:**  cutting back on pesticides and I was doing a lot of speaking at conventional conferences  
**0:34:32-0:34:37:**  and I got started being asked to speak at organic conferences because cover crops are  
**0:34:37-0:34:44:**  pretty new there also and I was shocked because I just viewed organic as awesome outside of  
**0:34:44-0:34:51:**  tillage but I realized sadly that organic and conventional agriculture are basically  
**0:34:51-0:34:52:**  the same.  
**0:34:52-0:34:55:**  They're both systems designed to kill.  
**0:34:55-0:34:58:**  Both those farmers wake up every day, what do I have to kill today?  
**0:34:58-0:34:59:**  Is it a bug?  
**0:34:59-0:35:01:**  Is it a weed or what?  
**0:35:01-0:35:06:**  We need to start waking up every day thinking, what do I need to grow today?  
**0:35:06-0:35:07:**  Not what do I need to kill?  
**0:35:07-0:35:09:**  What do I need to grow?  
**0:35:09-0:35:10:**  That's golden.  
**0:35:10-0:35:14:**  See, this is why I do the summary at the end.

**0:00:00-0:00:29:**  We're starting out with Adam Chappell's regeneratively grown rice.  
**0:00:29-0:00:30:**  I'm super excited.  
**0:00:30-0:00:34:**  He's been texting me the last two days asking how the milling's been going.  
**0:00:34-0:00:40:**  We are actually going to be milling brown rice flour, white rice flour.  
**0:00:40-0:00:44:**  And then we also have his rice that we're going to bag up and just sell as rice.  
**0:00:45-0:00:47:**  Yeah, this is so exciting.  
**0:00:47-0:00:50:**  You've been, I've been following this journey for years.  
**0:00:50-0:00:54:**  You've been, you know, you've gotten to know Adam, you've met in person.  
**0:00:54-0:00:58:**  You really have looked at his growing practices and to return to the most simple  
**0:00:58-0:01:01:**  thing, which is a farmer working directly with a brand.  
**0:01:01-0:01:03:**  What I had hoped for all day.  
**0:01:03-0:01:06:**  You're making it happen, Jen.  
**0:01:06-0:01:07:**  You're living my dream.  
**0:01:08-0:01:13:**  You made it happen actually, because if it wasn't for me knowing you through  
**0:01:13-0:01:17:**  another business that we worked with and then came, you started Grounded Growth  
**0:01:17-0:01:20:**  Network, I would have never met any of the farmers.  
**0:01:20-0:01:25:**  And now we're even, you know, Grounded Growth is part of even a bigger system,  
**0:01:25-0:01:29:**  Joe Clapperton's network, and I'm glad that Grounded Growth still exists and  
**0:01:29-0:01:33:**  that you're still here doing this because I just was thinking about it and it made  
**0:01:33-0:01:35:**  me tear up too, like, I don't think I'd be here without you.  
**0:01:36-0:01:38:**  Oh, so make me tear up.  
**0:01:38-0:01:39:**  Look, now you're making me cry.  
**0:01:40-0:01:42:**  But yes, yes.  
**0:01:42-0:01:46:**  That's what every interviewer aspires to make the guest cry.  
**0:01:46-0:01:49:**  Well, yeah, and my passion for saving the earth and being nice to it.  
**0:01:50-0:01:50:**  Yeah.  
**0:01:50-0:01:54:**  Since I was a kid, you know, I didn't know how I was going to get about doing that  
**0:01:54-0:01:59:**  as an adult, and this is my way of contributing is through supporting the  
**0:01:59-0:02:03:**  regenerative farmers who are trying to save our planet from the climate change  
**0:02:03-0:02:07:**  and in exchange, being able to support them by having my own food brand and  
**0:02:07-0:02:12:**  putting their product directly into our food and then providing that to the  
**0:02:12-0:02:33:**  consumer and then just keeps going on and on and on.  
**0:02:33-0:02:38:**  Welcome back to our podcast, Tasting Terroir, a journey that helps you cut  
**0:02:38-0:02:43:**  through the marketing claims of, quote, better for you food by understanding the  
**0:02:43-0:02:47:**  link between healthy soil and the flavor and health of your food.  
**0:02:47-0:02:49:**  I'm your host, Sarah Harper.  
**0:02:50-0:02:54:**  That clip was from an interview I did with my dear friend, Jennifer Koehr,  
**0:02:54-0:02:57:**  owner of around the world gourmet pizza company.  
**0:02:58-0:03:01:**  Jennifer has been working hard to bring the regenerative products farmers  
**0:03:01-0:03:04:**  grow to market for several years now.  
**0:03:04-0:03:07:**  And she is now actually doing it.  
**0:03:07-0:03:11:**  As you may recall from our episode last week, the big brands that you've heard  
**0:03:11-0:03:15:**  about are not really bringing regenerative ingredients to your door.  
**0:03:16-0:03:20:**  They're doing a lot of marketing about it, but they're not really buying in a  
**0:03:20-0:03:25:**  big way the ingredients that could make the products you buy regenerative.  
**0:03:26-0:03:32:**  To find this regenerative food source, you need to think small and local, like  
**0:03:32-0:03:36:**  the farmers we've interviewed in the podcast so far, who are not only growing  
**0:03:36-0:03:40:**  food in a regenerative way, but also creating ways for the public to buy  
**0:03:40-0:03:42:**  directly from them.  
**0:03:43-0:03:49:**  This week, we explore how a small food manufacturer sees the issue and how her  
**0:03:49-0:03:53:**  dedication and perseverance are almost single handedly bringing you the  
**0:03:53-0:03:57:**  opportunity to taste the difference regenerative rice can make.  
**0:03:57-0:04:01:**  Jennifer Kohler is one of those people who just never quits.  
**0:04:01-0:04:05:**  A finance major turned baker and then small business owner.  
**0:04:05-0:04:09:**  Jennifer has been making some of the best gluten-free pizza crusts on  
**0:04:09-0:04:10:**  the market for several years.  
**0:04:11-0:04:16:**  Being a gluten-free consumer myself for some 12 years now, I can tell you I've  
**0:04:16-0:04:19:**  tried every possible GF pizza option out there.  
**0:04:20-0:04:25:**  And while some of them have gotten pretty good, there are still a number of them  
**0:04:25-0:04:28:**  that are far less delicious than their gluten-y counterparts.  
**0:04:29-0:04:35:**  Jennifer's pizza, however, is so good that it can pass as a regular thin  
**0:04:35-0:04:36:**  pizza crust.  
**0:04:36-0:04:41:**  In fact, some of the folks that buy her pizzas in her store in rural Ohio don't  
**0:04:41-0:04:43:**  even know that they're gluten-free.  
**0:04:44-0:04:45:**  More about all that later.  
**0:04:47-0:04:52:**  In this episode, I want you to really absorb just what it takes to bring  
**0:04:52-0:04:55:**  better ingredients into the products that you buy.  
**0:04:56-0:05:02:**  How much effort and risk and expense and how much of it is being born by those  
**0:05:02-0:05:07:**  who can least afford to do it because they believe in it so much.  
**0:05:09-0:05:14:**  You really have so much power to shape the course of the food industry by  
**0:05:14-0:05:19:**  supporting dedicated true believers like Jennifer and the others that we're  
**0:05:19-0:05:20:**  profiling in this podcast.  
**0:05:20-0:05:25:**  For sure, if you are in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, or Columbus, Ohio areas,  
**0:05:26-0:05:31:**  and you care about better food and the planet or both, you are going to love  
**0:05:31-0:05:35:**  this brand and this woman just like I do.  
**0:05:36-0:05:40:**  Here's my interview with Jennifer Kohler, owner of Around the World Gourmet and  
**0:05:40-0:05:52:**  Regen Ball.  
**0:05:52-0:05:53:**  Hi, Jen, how are you?  
**0:05:53-0:05:56:**  Hi, I am good.  
**0:05:56-0:05:59:**  I've been a little bit emotional this morning thinking about all the things  
**0:05:59-0:06:00:**  that we're doing.  
**0:06:00-0:06:01:**  It's so great.  
**0:06:01-0:06:02:**  Yeah.  
**0:06:02-0:06:04:**  Well, very exciting.  
**0:06:04-0:06:04:**  Good.  
**0:06:04-0:06:09:**  Before we get into that, tell everybody who you are and what your business is,  
**0:06:09-0:06:10:**  what you're doing and where you're at.  
**0:06:11-0:06:12:**  It's Jennifer Kohler.  
**0:06:13-0:06:15:**  I'm in Eastern Ohio.  
**0:06:16-0:06:18:**  I'm right near the Ohio River.  
**0:06:18-0:06:25:**  I'm about 45 minutes southwest of Pittsburgh and about two hours east of  
**0:06:25-0:06:26:**  Columbus.  
**0:06:26-0:06:28:**  This is my hometown area.  
**0:06:28-0:06:30:**  I live in St.  
**0:06:30-0:06:31:**  Clairsville.  
**0:06:31-0:06:36:**  I'm from Belmont County and our business is located in Bellaire, Ohio.  
**0:06:36-0:06:40:**  So anybody in the Pittsburgh area that wanted to take a regenerative trip could  
**0:06:40-0:06:41:**  just hop in the car.  
**0:06:41-0:06:42:**  45 minutes?  
**0:06:42-0:06:43:**  45 minutes.  
**0:06:43-0:06:44:**  There you go.  
**0:06:44-0:06:45:**  Not that far.  
**0:06:45-0:06:46:**  Yeah.  
**0:06:46-0:06:47:**  Yeah.  
**0:06:47-0:06:50:**  And so here I am with a business, a food company.  
**0:06:51-0:06:56:**  Kohler Foods International is the corporate name, doing business as Around  
**0:06:56-0:07:01:**  the World Gourmet, which is my food brand, and now also doing business as  
**0:07:01-0:07:02:**  Regenerative Mills.  
**0:07:02-0:07:05:**  So, and we'll talk about that here in a minute.  
**0:07:05-0:07:07:**  And what products do you make?  
**0:07:08-0:07:14:**  So we are a manufacturer of gluten-free vegan pizza crusts.  
**0:07:14-0:07:16:**  I have other recipes that I have.  
**0:07:16-0:07:18:**  That don't taste like it, I might add.  
**0:07:18-0:07:20:**  Yes, that does not taste like it.  
**0:07:22-0:07:25:**  Some of those can be a little taste challenged, if you will.  
**0:07:25-0:07:31:**  And I have had the good fortune to sample them many times and can  
**0:07:31-0:07:34:**  attest that they are, you know, you really can't tell the difference.  
**0:07:34-0:07:37:**  And in fact, a number of your patrons don't even know that they're  
**0:07:38-0:07:38:**  That's true.  
**0:07:38-0:07:39:**  That's true.  
**0:07:39-0:07:40:**  Yeah.  
**0:07:41-0:07:45:**  We are manufacturing these gluten-free pizza crusts and having distributors  
**0:07:45-0:07:45:**  pick them up.  
**0:07:45-0:07:51:**  And then we ship, we ship things out as well that are to like the University of  
**0:07:51-0:07:54:**  Iowa and Denison University here in Ohio.  
**0:07:54-0:08:01:**  We just got into a pizza chain called Pizza Joe's out of Pennsylvania, Western  
**0:08:01-0:08:07:**  PA that has 42 units and all those pizza crusts just got picked up today.  
**0:08:07-0:08:10:**  So yeah, the pizza crust that you're talking about, we do have a small  
**0:08:10-0:08:14:**  retail front and I wanted to prove to everybody that our pizza crusts are  
**0:08:14-0:08:20:**  the best and they do not taste like the typical gluten-free crust.  
**0:08:20-0:08:25:**  And so I forced the entire Ohio Valley here to eat our pizza.  
**0:08:27-0:08:29:**  And they don't, they can't tell the difference.  
**0:08:29-0:08:35:**  So we even on online apps like DoorDash and delivery.com, we don't  
**0:08:35-0:08:36:**  even say that it's gluten-free.  
**0:08:37-0:08:38:**  Even on our menu, it doesn't say that.  
**0:08:39-0:08:40:**  It's just thin crust pizza.  
**0:08:42-0:08:42:**  Yeah.  
**0:08:42-0:08:46:**  Well, maybe you should in case there are people nearby that could  
**0:08:46-0:08:47:**  say you have a gluten-free option.  
**0:08:47-0:08:49:**  The one we do, we have that on there too.  
**0:08:50-0:08:50:**  Okay.  
**0:08:50-0:08:53:**  We say that we have a gluten-free option, but it's actually all the same crust.  
**0:08:55-0:08:55:**  That's so good.  
**0:08:55-0:09:00:**  I love that story because you took over, you know, there had been a  
**0:09:00-0:09:03:**  convenience store there and it had been famous for its pepperoni rolls  
**0:09:03-0:09:04:**  and people really loved them.  
**0:09:04-0:09:09:**  And so, but you, you know, you added to this beloved tradition by creating  
**0:09:09-0:09:12:**  a gluten-free version of the pepperoni rolls for people, right?  
**0:09:12-0:09:12:**  That's correct.  
**0:09:12-0:09:13:**  Yeah.  
**0:09:13-0:09:13:**  Yeah.  
**0:09:14-0:09:16:**  Pepperoni rolls are, you know, you can't just say that it's a  
**0:09:16-0:09:39:**  chicken roll roll roll, it's a supporting roll as a Hellmuth  
**0:09:39-0:09:30:**  Ch  
**0:09:30-0:09:33:**  press. You bake it. Yeah. It's called a pepperoni roll.  
**0:09:34-0:09:36:**  The exciting part that you'll talk more about later is that  
**0:09:36-0:09:40:**  you've added a mill to your to your business too. And what are  
**0:09:40-0:09:41:**  you going to be milling?  
**0:09:41-0:09:46:**  We're going to be milling flour, and specifically, as much as  
**0:09:46-0:09:48:**  possible regenerative flour.  
**0:09:49-0:09:51:**  Made out of not wheat.  
**0:09:51-0:09:54:**  Not wheat, because it has to be gluten free in my building, but  
**0:09:54-0:09:58:**  I can't have wheat, barley or rye in here. It would just get  
**0:09:58-0:10:01:**  through all it would get everywhere. And we can't have  
**0:10:01-0:10:05:**  the cross contamination. But we're starting out with Adam  
**0:10:05-0:10:09:**  Adam Chapels regeneratively grown rice. I'm super excited.  
**0:10:09-0:10:12:**  He's been texting me the last two days asking how the milling  
**0:10:12-0:10:17:**  has been going. We're starting with 16,000 pounds because I  
**0:10:17-0:10:20:**  just I need the I don't have enough space for any more at the  
**0:10:20-0:10:23:**  moment. And he has the space. He's keeping it there on his  
**0:10:23-0:10:28:**  farm until I'm ready for the next shipment. We are actually  
**0:10:28-0:10:33:**  going to be milling brown rice flour, white rice flour, we can  
**0:10:33-0:10:40:**  do 100 mash, we can do 200 mash, even finer. And then we also  
**0:10:40-0:10:43:**  have his rice that we're going to bag up and just sell his  
**0:10:43-0:10:44:**  rice for cooking.  
**0:10:45-0:10:48:**  This is so exciting. You've been I've been following this journey  
**0:10:48-0:10:52:**  for years. You've been you know, you've gotten to know Adam,  
**0:10:52-0:10:54:**  you've you've met in person, you really have looked at his  
**0:10:55-0:11:01:**  growing practices and and so many hurdles to overcome to get  
**0:11:01-0:11:05:**  a direct relationship to it's to be as simple to return to the  
**0:11:05-0:11:08:**  most simple thing, which is a farmer working directly with a  
**0:11:08-0:11:12:**  brand, what I had hoped for all day. Yeah, you're making it  
**0:11:12-0:11:14:**  happen, Jen, you're living your dream.  
**0:11:15-0:11:19:**  You made it happen, actually. Because if it wasn't for me  
**0:11:19-0:11:21:**  knowing you through another business that we worked with,  
**0:11:21-0:11:24:**  and then came, you started Grounded Growth Network, I would  
**0:11:24-0:11:30:**  have never met any of the farmers. And now we're even, you  
**0:11:30-0:11:34:**  know, Grounded Growth is part of even a bigger system, Jill  
**0:11:34-0:11:37:**  Clapperton's network. And I'm glad that Grounded Growth still  
**0:11:37-0:11:41:**  exists and that you're still here doing this because I just  
**0:11:41-0:11:43:**  was thinking about it. And it made me tear up to like, I don't  
**0:11:43-0:11:45:**  think I'd be here without you.  
**0:11:45-0:11:47:**  Oh, so make me tear up.  
**0:11:47-0:11:49:**  Look, now you're making me cry.  
**0:11:49-0:11:51:**  Yes, yes.  
**0:11:51-0:11:55:**  What every interviewer aspires to make the guest cry.  
**0:11:56-0:11:59:**  Yeah, and my passion for saving the earth and being nice to it.  
**0:11:59-0:12:03:**  Yeah. Since I was a kid, you know, I didn't know how I was  
**0:12:03-0:12:07:**  gonna get about doing that as an adult. And this is my way of  
**0:12:07-0:12:10:**  contributing is through supporting the regenerative  
**0:12:10-0:12:14:**  farmers who are trying to save our planet from climate change  
**0:12:14-0:12:19:**  and in exchange, being able to support them by having my own  
**0:12:19-0:12:23:**  food brand and putting their product directly into our food  
**0:12:23-0:12:26:**  and then providing that to the consumer and then just keeps  
**0:12:26-0:12:29:**  going on and on and on. So now I have other other farmers  
**0:12:29-0:12:32:**  reaching out that want sorghum, their sorghum that they've grown  
**0:12:32-0:12:40:**  regeneratively, milled and you know, millet, teff, and other  
**0:12:40-0:12:43:**  brands. Yeah, we can buy the flour from you and put it into  
**0:12:43-0:12:46:**  their ingredients. Exactly. But yeah, all these great people in  
**0:12:46-0:12:50:**  our community that you're able to, you're on the same path,  
**0:12:50-0:12:53:**  but you know, it's hard to overcome these hurdles alone. So  
**0:12:53-0:12:57:**  that's part of the point of the community. Well, the other thing  
**0:12:57-0:13:01:**  in doing these interviews, I have heard a lot of great, great  
**0:13:01-0:13:04:**  insights about what is regenerative. But you know, a  
**0:13:04-0:13:06:**  number of people have talked about it beyond just the  
**0:13:06-0:13:11:**  practices on the farm, but you know, regenerating the community  
**0:13:11-0:13:14:**  around around them and that regenerating themselves and  
**0:13:14-0:13:17:**  their family as part of being part of this work. And it really  
**0:13:17-0:13:20:**  struck me with you at a whole different level. I mean,  
**0:13:20-0:13:23:**  certainly there's the regenerative work that you're  
**0:13:23-0:13:27:**  doing with the farmer, really taking on that small retail  
**0:13:27-0:13:30:**  store, there aren't a whole lot of you're in kind of a food  
**0:13:30-0:13:33:**  desert, right? I mean, there aren't a lot of places to get  
**0:13:33-0:13:38:**  fresh fruit around you. And, and certainly not ones that are  
**0:13:38-0:13:43:**  gluten free, probably, you know, yeah. And, you know, so you like  
**0:13:43-0:13:46:**  taking over that and milling your manufacturing your pizza  
**0:13:46-0:13:51:**  crust, and now milling where you are in rural, you know, Ohio,  
**0:13:52-0:13:55:**  you're keeping those jobs and the impact that I know you've  
**0:13:55-0:13:59:**  had in those people's lives. And it's been challenging. There are  
**0:13:59-0:14:02:**  a lot of things, you know, that are challenging in the rural  
**0:14:02-0:14:06:**  economy, and that your business keeps them going as well as the  
**0:14:06-0:14:10:**  planet, you know, it's a really regenerative beyond, you know,  
**0:14:10-0:14:11:**  the agriculture.  
**0:14:12-0:14:16:**  It's a lot of education, for sure. And I think that is what  
**0:14:16-0:14:20:**  we have to do in general, even across the world is to just  
**0:14:20-0:14:23:**  continue to educate everyone on regenerative agriculture. The  
**0:14:23-0:14:26:**  education part is just continuing to tell people what  
**0:14:26-0:14:30:**  regenerative is, why I'm doing it. And we actually have a  
**0:14:30-0:14:33:**  ribbon cutting going on tomorrow where a lot of the people here  
**0:14:33-0:14:37:**  locally are invited to come for our new mill, and we're doing  
**0:14:37-0:14:40:**  pizza tasting. So I think that'll even be more education  
**0:14:40-0:14:43:**  that local news stations are here and we've sent press  
**0:14:43-0:14:43:**  releases out.  
**0:14:43-0:14:46:**  What is your definition of regenerative agriculture?  
**0:14:47-0:14:51:**  The definition of regenerative agriculture to me is about the  
**0:14:51-0:14:54:**  climate change part of it. And I know that there are other  
**0:14:54-0:14:58:**  benefits, obviously. But regenerative agriculture is a  
**0:14:58-0:15:03:**  process that I think is a continuing process. It's not  
**0:15:03-0:15:07:**  just one thing, it's multiple things that can be done on the  
**0:15:07-0:15:12:**  farms. You know, the no till obviously, that has to, the no  
**0:15:12-0:15:15:**  till has to happen is what I mean, the tilling has to stop.  
**0:15:15-0:15:18:**  The first thing that has to happen is, I feel like if you're  
**0:15:18-0:15:21:**  going to be a regenerative farmer is you have to know, no  
**0:15:21-0:15:25:**  till or low till, for sure. Then you can, there's other things  
**0:15:25-0:15:27:**  that you can do, like the intercropping and the  
**0:15:27-0:15:32:**  covercropping and not using as much water. And then, you know,  
**0:15:32-0:15:36:**  I know that they have difficulty with the weed control. So then  
**0:15:36-0:15:39:**  you have to think about that. And then there's also the  
**0:15:39-0:15:43:**  animals being brought on. So there's a lot of different ways  
**0:15:44-0:15:46:**  to be regenerative. But definitely the first thing for  
**0:15:46-0:15:52:**  me is that this carbon needs to stay in the soil and to keep the  
**0:15:52-0:15:56:**  planet cool and help with the climate change issues that we  
**0:15:56-0:15:58:**  have, that definitely is mandatory.  
**0:15:58-0:16:02:**  And from what we've learned, you know, there, there aren't a  
**0:16:02-0:16:05:**  whole lot of rice growers that are doing what Adam is doing in  
**0:16:05-0:16:09:**  Arkansas. So that's kind of a nice, a rare thing, to give him  
**0:16:09-0:16:13:**  a specific market and a path to keep doing what he's doing and  
**0:16:13-0:16:16:**  for other farmers to maybe follow his practices. He's been  
**0:16:16-0:16:19:**  featured all sorts of different places. And if you just do a  
**0:16:19-0:16:22:**  search for Adam Japel, you'll find all sorts of interviews  
**0:16:22-0:16:26:**  he's done. And in the farm world, he's kind of famous. So  
**0:16:26-0:16:30:**  it's it's super, it's such a wonderful step forward that that  
**0:16:30-0:16:33:**  is a market for him. And for other and a signal to other  
**0:16:33-0:16:38:**  farmers that making these changes, they can actually  
**0:16:38-0:16:42:**  benefit from that financially, not just a pat on the back and  
**0:16:42-0:16:49:**  feature does a box, which is nice and all but yeah, it's a  
**0:16:49-0:16:51:**  real it's a real market connection.  
**0:16:51-0:16:54:**  It is and there are going to be for the farmers out there that  
**0:16:54-0:16:56:**  are listening to this, you are going to struggle, there are  
**0:16:56-0:16:59:**  going to be things that you're not going to know, just like in  
**0:16:59-0:17:03:**  our process, the farmers normally go and just drop off,  
**0:17:03-0:17:06:**  you know, their grains to a silo. And they never had to  
**0:17:06-0:17:09:**  think about how long is it going to take for me to get into the  
**0:17:09-0:17:13:**  cleaners because they already have customers in line. So that  
**0:17:13-0:17:17:**  was one of the things we had to figure out. And, you know, rice  
**0:17:17-0:17:20:**  being harvested in November thinking we're going to get it  
**0:17:20-0:17:23:**  immediately. And then, you know, learning that we had to wait and  
**0:17:23-0:17:27:**  line for the cleaner, take the brand or take the haul off, and  
**0:17:27-0:17:31:**  then also finding out that this race has to be dried to a  
**0:17:31-0:17:34:**  certain point, and then tested it before you can even take it  
**0:17:34-0:17:37:**  to the cleaner. We had some growing pains with that. And  
**0:17:37-0:17:39:**  there's going to be growing pains for everybody. But you  
**0:17:39-0:17:42:**  just, you just take some deep breaths and you keep going  
**0:17:42-0:17:46:**  because I certainly I do not want to go live on the moon. And  
**0:17:46-0:17:53:**  I don't go live. I don't I like we have a beautiful planet. And  
**0:17:53-0:17:55:**  we just need to make sure that we're not destroying it. It's  
**0:17:55-0:17:59:**  been given to us as a gift. Yes. And I feel like there's a lot of  
**0:17:59-0:18:01:**  people who don't think like that. They just trash it. They  
**0:18:01-0:18:04:**  just throw their cups out, litter all over the place, very  
**0:18:04-0:18:11:**  destructive behavior. So regeneration of this earth is  
**0:18:11-0:18:15:**  very important to me and future generations. The farmers that  
**0:18:15-0:18:19:**  are doing this and practicing this way and leading, you know,  
**0:18:19-0:18:23:**  leading us all down the right path is that's who I want to  
**0:18:23-0:18:24:**  have relationships with.  
**0:18:24-0:18:28:**  Because I know we've been on a small business journey,  
**0:18:28-0:18:33:**  solopreneur. You have more than you're not solo, but small,  
**0:18:33-0:18:36:**  small business path. You've been on that path for some time. And  
**0:18:36-0:18:40:**  it's so hard, and especially through COVID. And through, you  
**0:18:40-0:18:42:**  know, there are all sorts of curves that you've been thrown.  
**0:18:43-0:18:47:**  And it seems like, you know, I know a lot of people would have  
**0:18:47-0:18:52:**  let go of this regenerative path of sourcing because it is an  
**0:18:52-0:18:54:**  added, potentially an added expense. I think it's going to  
**0:18:54-0:18:58:**  be added value too. But there's been such pressure. And, you  
**0:18:58-0:19:03:**  know, I've talked with so many bigger brands that aren't  
**0:19:03-0:19:08:**  willing to do what you are doing, you know, that are  
**0:19:08-0:19:13:**  marketing on regenerative, but aren't anywhere near, you know,  
**0:19:13-0:19:16:**  the direct connection to a farm and knowing of the practices  
**0:19:16-0:19:19:**  that you have and that you're going to make possible for all  
**0:19:19-0:19:23:**  these brands now to buy regeneratively grown rice and  
**0:19:23-0:19:26:**  rice flour and other gluten free flowers.  
**0:19:26-0:19:29:**  I always feel like I'm behind and that we're behind. We are  
**0:19:29-0:19:34:**  behind. I don't want to wait. I mean, I'm not sure what the big  
**0:19:34-0:19:37:**  companies are waiting for or what their strategy is.  
**0:19:37-0:19:39:**  They're waiting for you to be successful and then they'll  
**0:19:39-0:19:44:**  follow me. Waiting for someone else to prove the concept that  
**0:19:44-0:19:48:**  consumers do actually want it. And it saddens me because the  
**0:19:48-0:19:51:**  people with the most money to take the risk have not done it.  
**0:19:51-0:19:52:**  And, you know,  
**0:19:52-0:19:55:**  Yeah. And the ones that don't have the money, we have to go  
**0:19:55-0:19:55:**  out.  
**0:19:56-0:19:59:**  Well, you're living on the belief in it.  
**0:19:59-0:20:02:**  Yeah. We have to go through the struggle to get there, but it'll  
**0:20:02-0:20:03:**  be worth it.  
**0:20:03-0:20:07:**  Yeah, I know. This is such a huge breakthrough to actually  
**0:20:07-0:20:10:**  have flour. Like you texted me a picture of, you know, the first  
**0:20:10-0:20:15:**  flour that we made. And how exciting. I mean, how exciting  
**0:20:15-0:20:19:**  that you now have the ability to turn this. That's been the big  
**0:20:19-0:20:23:**  barrier to take a crop and get it into an ingredient because  
**0:20:23-0:20:26:**  most of the mills don't just don't want to deal with it. It's  
**0:20:26-0:20:29:**  too small of a project or they don't want to separate it out or  
**0:20:30-0:20:33:**  it's too new or, you know, any excuse you can imagine we've  
**0:20:33-0:20:36:**  heard it because the first option wasn't for you to  
**0:20:36-0:20:37:**  necessarily build your own.  
**0:20:37-0:20:44:**  No, I wasn't anticipating that. And then one day I'm like, I  
**0:20:44-0:20:46:**  don't know, these things don't scare me. Like it scares some  
**0:20:46-0:20:47:**  people.  
**0:20:47-0:20:53:**  Yes. Like me. You're going to do the next thing. I'm like, okay,  
**0:20:53-0:20:54:**  what are you doing?  
**0:20:56-0:20:59:**  Yeah. Well, you know, and I got to learn how to use it  
**0:20:59-0:21:03:**  yesterday. You know, the guy, the engineering company that  
**0:21:03-0:21:06:**  had bought the milling equipment from, he drove in from Iowa two  
**0:21:06-0:21:11:**  days ago. We started it up Tuesday and then yesterday I got  
**0:21:11-0:21:15:**  my training and it's really not that hard. I mean, yeah, I'm  
**0:21:15-0:21:19:**  gonna have to lift some, some bags or somebody here is gonna  
**0:21:19-0:21:25:**  have to lift some bags. But this equipment, I mean, it's not as  
**0:21:25-0:21:29:**  small. It's not small, but it's also huge. The biggest one  
**0:21:29-0:21:34:**  either. The milling equipment that we have can run up to, if I  
**0:21:34-0:21:40:**  really maxed it out, 842 pounds per hour. And that's a smaller,  
**0:21:40-0:21:44:**  that's like one of the smaller this, this tight mill, a  
**0:21:44-0:21:48:**  pulverizer. It does just that. If you go with a hammer mill, or  
**0:21:48-0:21:51:**  milling rights, you basically have to run it through more than  
**0:21:51-0:21:55:**  one time to try to get the fineness to it. So this one, you  
**0:21:55-0:21:58:**  do not have to do that. I can run it through one time and  
**0:21:58-0:22:02:**  still get 200 mesh, which is really fine, really fun. Baby  
**0:22:02-0:22:06:**  powder on. I did pay a little extra in upgrading some pieces  
**0:22:06-0:22:09:**  of equipment so that when we do need to expand to the height,  
**0:22:10-0:22:13:**  the bigger size pulverizer, the other pieces are already in  
**0:22:13-0:22:17:**  place, and can handle the bigger motor size.  
**0:22:17-0:22:20:**  You know, we talked about your definition of regenerative. And  
**0:22:21-0:22:23:**  in some of the ways you're describing, you know, what  
**0:22:23-0:22:25:**  you're doing working with Adam, that's, that's how you're  
**0:22:25-0:22:28:**  practicing it, right? That's how your company is practicing it.  
**0:22:28-0:22:30:**  But are there any other pieces you want to add about that?  
**0:22:30-0:22:33:**  What are the things that we're doing as a brand? Yeah, all of  
**0:22:33-0:22:37:**  our containers that we have here are like to go containers, I've  
**0:22:37-0:22:40:**  gotten rid of all styrofoam that was in this building when I took  
**0:22:40-0:22:46:**  over and we now have plant based containers, compostable  
**0:22:46-0:22:50:**  containers that we use. We have energy efficient equipment. You  
**0:22:50-0:22:54:**  know, we try not to waste water. We don't waste water. We don't  
**0:22:54-0:22:58:**  like to waste anything we recycle. So when I called the  
**0:22:58-0:23:03:**  local recycling and company and they have a bunch of bins that  
**0:23:03-0:23:06:**  they brought down to us, we could recycle. We're wanting to  
**0:23:06-0:23:10:**  be a benefit corporation. So I think we're ready for that. I  
**0:23:10-0:23:13:**  just felt the flour, I stuck it in my hand yesterday. And it was  
**0:23:13-0:23:19:**  just very fulfilling. It's like a big grin on my face. And  
**0:23:19-0:23:22:**  holding Adam's rice. Should I walk out so you can see? Should I  
**0:23:22-0:23:26:**  take my last? And that is what you're using now to make your  
**0:23:26-0:23:30:**  pizzas? Yes, the pizza crust. Yeah. And other brands are now  
**0:23:30-0:23:34:**  lucky enough to be able to buy flour from you right? To make  
**0:23:34-0:23:40:**  their regenerative rice products. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And  
**0:23:40-0:23:43:**  then after that, we'll, I've been in some conversations with  
**0:23:43-0:23:49:**  other farmers that are, they've got sorghum and the white  
**0:23:49-0:23:54:**  sorghum. So we'll be talking to them further about milling that.  
**0:23:54-0:23:57:**  Coming back around, you've talked all about this, all this  
**0:23:57-0:24:00:**  great stuff. I'm going to have you sum up what regenerative  
**0:24:00-0:24:03:**  means to you in a couple sentences, which I know that's  
**0:24:03-0:24:06:**  hard, hard to define. So fill in the sentence. regenerative  
**0:24:06-0:24:12:**  agriculture is regenerative agriculture is a way of helping  
**0:24:12-0:24:17:**  with climate change and global warming. By no tilling on our  
**0:24:17-0:24:23:**  farms, keeping the the earth and all its ecosystem in place. We  
**0:24:23-0:24:29:**  can have more nutrient dense foods from this. It's important  
**0:24:29-0:24:33:**  for us to continue down this path and having regenerative  
**0:24:33-0:24:37:**  agriculture and the farmers doing these practices, so that  
**0:24:37-0:24:41:**  we can help with, like I said, the global warming, having more  
**0:24:41-0:24:44:**  nutrient dense foods. And that's what it that's what it means to  
**0:24:44-0:24:47:**  me. Do you think it's something that consumers are looking for?  
**0:24:48-0:24:52:**  Yeah, I think that there are some consumers that definitely  
**0:24:52-0:24:57:**  care about this. We've seen that they've cared a lot about  
**0:24:57-0:25:03:**  organic in the past. And this is just the next step of them  
**0:25:03-0:25:06:**  caring, you know, there's people that care about your bodies and  
**0:25:06-0:25:10:**  what you you are what you eat. The thing with the organic right  
**0:25:10-0:25:14:**  now is that most of them still have to till because of weeds  
**0:25:15-0:25:19:**  control and I do believe that consumers are going to love  
**0:25:19-0:25:22:**  this, they're going to love the connection with the farmers and  
**0:25:22-0:25:25:**  the farmer. They're going to love the fact that it's helping  
**0:25:25-0:25:30:**  what you know, they're actually able to by eating, let's say our  
**0:25:30-0:25:34:**  pizza. Okay, we actually have a tagline healthier for you and  
**0:25:34-0:25:39:**  our planet, and also save the planet one pizza at a time. I  
**0:25:39-0:25:41:**  think they're gonna feel like they're part of something  
**0:25:41-0:25:44:**  bigger. Again, it's education, education, education and  
**0:25:44-0:25:47:**  marketing. Like you have to let people know that you exist.  
**0:25:48-0:25:52:**  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is not that far from you. That's a nice  
**0:25:52-0:25:57:**  city. And Columbus is not that far. And it's huge. It's Yeah,  
**0:25:58-0:26:01:**  it's amazing. I mean, yeah. Normally, you wouldn't see a  
**0:26:01-0:26:04:**  place like what I have here, especially on the retail end  
**0:26:04-0:26:09:**  being where I'm at. We are listed on some of the apps for  
**0:26:09-0:26:14:**  finding gluten free locations like restaurants. And let's see  
**0:26:14-0:26:18:**  in the last two weeks, I've served somebody from the DC  
**0:26:18-0:26:22:**  area in Northern Virginia. They were a mother and daughter were  
**0:26:22-0:26:26:**  in Indiana, I believe, visiting a college and they were coming  
**0:26:26-0:26:30:**  back through. And they found my place because Interstate 70  
**0:26:30-0:26:34:**  runs right through our county. And so they stopped here for a  
**0:26:34-0:26:37:**  bite. And we actually had some tables up so they could sit down  
**0:26:37-0:26:39:**  finally, because we were just a takeout place. But now we have  
**0:26:39-0:26:44:**  dining. And they were so excited. And they actually said  
**0:26:44-0:26:46:**  to me, I wish we had a place like this where I lived. And I'm  
**0:26:46-0:26:51:**  like, you live near DC. I'm like, is there? And I'm thinking,  
**0:26:51-0:26:55:**  wow, okay, well, maybe, you know, that was a compliment. The  
**0:26:55-0:27:00:**  other there was, was it yesterday or day before a woman  
**0:27:00-0:27:04:**  came in with her two children. And her son had celiac disease,  
**0:27:04-0:27:07:**  and they were excited. And I said, have you not been here  
**0:27:07-0:27:11:**  before? She's like, No, I'm from Massachusetts. Okay, what are  
**0:27:11-0:27:15:**  you doing here? She said, Well, I have family that live in  
**0:27:15-0:27:21:**  Steubenville and Martin's Ferry, which are two towns north of  
**0:27:21-0:27:26:**  here, about 30 minutes and about 15 minutes away. And she had not  
**0:27:26-0:27:30:**  been here for like six years. But she came back to visit and  
**0:27:30-0:27:34:**  got the app out and saw that there was a gluten free place  
**0:27:34-0:27:37:**  here and came down and she's like, this is amazing. The food  
**0:27:37-0:27:41:**  is great. The pizza is great. So they were really happy.  
**0:27:41-0:27:45:**  You know, if you have people in Columbus, in Pittsburgh, that  
**0:27:45-0:27:48:**  want to be connected to a brand into a farm, they're really  
**0:27:49-0:27:53:**  blazing the path, they can do it. They can, they can order  
**0:27:53-0:27:57:**  flour from you, they can order products from you, they can, you  
**0:27:57-0:28:00:**  know, they can help you help this whole market grow. They  
**0:28:00-0:28:01:**  can be part of that.  
**0:28:02-0:28:05:**  And you know how we had, we had talked previously, Sarah, about,  
**0:28:06-0:28:08:**  we thought it was going to be a challenge because I'm in mostly  
**0:28:08-0:28:13:**  food service and not in retail stores. We didn't think that  
**0:28:13-0:28:17:**  food service would care as much. Well, that chain restaurant that  
**0:28:17-0:28:22:**  I just told you about the pizza parlor, Pizza Joe's out of  
**0:28:22-0:28:27:**  Newcastle, PA, they have the 42 units, when I went up there to  
**0:28:27-0:28:32:**  meet with them, they actually have a sustainability. So the  
**0:28:33-0:28:37:**  program, and that was one of the, I mean, obviously, the Pizza  
**0:28:37-0:28:41:**  Crest had to taste good, or they're not going to buy. But  
**0:28:41-0:28:44:**  they liked that I was checking off all the boxes for them.  
**0:28:44-0:28:47:**  Because, you know, their father had started the chain, but then  
**0:28:47-0:28:52:**  the two daughters who are adults and are running it now, he's  
**0:28:52-0:28:57:**  still involved, they've created the sustainability program and  
**0:28:57-0:28:59:**  love the fact that we were going to have regeneratively,  
**0:28:59-0:29:00:**  regenerative product.  
**0:29:01-0:29:04:**  If you're in Pennsylvania is go have a pizza, Pizza Joe's.  
**0:29:04-0:29:08:**  Yeah. Or even in Youngstown, I think Youngstown, Ohio, they  
**0:29:08-0:29:11:**  even have some of their shops.  
**0:29:11-0:29:15:**  I mean, how easy do we have to make it for you people? Right.  
**0:29:15-0:29:17:**  You know, easy has Jen made it for you.  
**0:29:19-0:29:24:**  And Adam and Seth Chappell grew the rice. They ship, you know, we  
**0:29:24-0:29:27:**  have a cleaner down there that he knew that he got it clean, it  
**0:29:27-0:29:30:**  gets to me, I mill it, making it into a pizza crust, and then the  
**0:29:30-0:29:34:**  pizza crust gets shipped out through Pennsylvania Macaroni,  
**0:29:34-0:29:36:**  one of my distributors out of Pittsburgh, and then gets to  
**0:29:36-0:29:37:**  Pizza Joe's.  
**0:29:37-0:29:41:**  That's awesome. And that's such a great story. I'm so glad it  
**0:29:41-0:29:41:**  has a happy ending.  
**0:29:43-0:29:46:**  I know it's very exciting. And I'm as tired as I am this week,

### Author(s): Sara (Hessenflow) Harper  

**0:00:00-0:00:18:**  Hello, and welcome back to our podcast, Tasting Terroir, where we are on a journey to explore  the link between healthy soil and the flavor of your food.  I'm your host, Sarah Harper.  
**0:00:25-0:00:31:**  This week, we took a peek into the soil microbiome, that world underground where billions of organisms  work together to build health and flavor for our food.  We also explored the concept of regenerative agriculture, a way of farming that restores  
**0:00:43-0:00:48:**  and renews the health of the soil by working with nature instead of against her.  But as you may remember, regenerative agriculture is not a checklist of practices.  More than anything, it is a change in the mindset of the farmer that then leads to many  
**0:00:59-0:01:02:**  other management changes on the farm.  That sounds good, but what does it really mean?  How does regenerative farming play out on the farm?  
**0:01:10-0:01:15:**  What kind of difference do these regenerative principles make in the food they create?  How do food brands incorporate regenerative into the ingredients they use?  And of course, can you taste the difference?  
**0:01:24-0:01:27:**  These are some of the questions that we're going to be exploring over the next several  weeks as we bring you interviews with farmers and emerging food brands in our online community,  the Global Food and Farm Network.  
**0:01:36-0:01:41:**  These are truly amazing people that I've had the pleasure of getting to know over the past  few years who are dedicated to building a healthier, tastier whole food system.  In this episode, I'm going to share brief clips from a few folks who you will be learning  
**0:01:53-0:01:56:**  a lot more about in future episodes.  And then we will dive into a full interview with some of my favorite regenerative farmers,  Canadians Derek and Tanis Axton.  
**0:02:04-0:02:09:**  To get us started, let's first hear from my co-host, Dr. Jill Clapperton, a top soil scientist  and plant physiologist.  I'm going to ask you to fill in the sentence, regenerative agriculture is.  
**0:02:21-0:02:27:**  Regenerative agriculture is about rehabilitation, restoring.  And I mean, when I say restoring, I mean restoring system function.  It's about aggregating, not splitting.  
**0:02:36-0:02:39:**  It's about bringing people together.  It's about bringing things together.  It's about creating communities, thriving, vibrant communities.  
**0:02:46-0:02:49:**  It's about diversity.  The regenerative is diverse, has a lot of diversity in it.  It has functioning communities and has function like it's functioning.  
**0:02:59-0:03:05:**  And it's like cooking with gas.  Regenerative you put the gas to it and it is bubbling in a really productive way.  It's like a magnet.  
**0:03:14-0:03:18:**  Everything is coming to it and it's building from that magnetic force and things are getting  stuck to it.  All sorts of different things are being stuck to it.  
**0:03:21-0:03:26:**  But it's growing and growing and growing in a really positive and productive way.  With Jill's great description in mind, we are starting to see the outlines of what regenerative  agriculture does and perhaps why the healthier soil it creates would lead to more flavorful  
**0:03:38-0:03:39:**  food.  Let's continue to fill in the outline with a few more folks.  Next you're going to hear from farmer Gail Fuller with Circle 7 Farms in Kansas, farmer  
**0:03:48-0:03:54:**  Deanna Lazinski and her brand of regenerative pasta, Guardian Grains of North Dakota, and  food company owner and regenerative ingredient maker, Jennifer Koehler with Around the World  Gourmet from Ohio.  
**0:04:01-0:04:08:**  To summarize it all down, I'm going to ask you to fill in the sentence, regenerative  agriculture is...  Regenerative agriculture is life.  
**0:04:14-0:04:15:**  Wow.  That's good.  You know, I used to talk about when I started out of the conventional world and started  
**0:04:25-0:04:30:**  cutting back on pesticides and I was doing a lot of speaking at conventional conferences  and I got started being asked to speak at organic conferences because cover crops are  pretty new there also.  
**0:04:37-0:04:42:**  And I was shocked because I just viewed organic as awesome outside of tillage.  But I realized sadly that organic and conventional agriculture are basically the same.  They're both systems designed to kill.  
**0:04:51-0:04:54:**  Both those farmers wake up every day, what do I have to kill today?  You know, is it a bug?  Is it a weed or what?  
**0:04:57-0:05:02:**  And we need to start waking up every day thinking, what do I need to grow today?  What do I need to kill?  What do I need to grow?  
**0:05:08-0:05:09:**  All right.  So Deanna, in one sentence or two, regenerative agriculture is...  Better food for people and animals.  
**0:05:21-0:05:22:**  This is great.  You said that, Chell.  No, no, it is.  
**0:05:24-0:05:27:**  There's a million other things it does.  Right.  But we are boiling it down to why it really matters.  
**0:05:32-0:05:37:**  Why it really matters is because it offers better food for people and animals.  And that's...  And I think the process of getting to that outcome is that you're rejuvenating the soil  
**0:05:47-0:05:51:**  and that then enables you to create a better product.  Right.  Oh, absolutely.  
**0:05:53-0:05:54:**  So it all starts.  My t-shirt says soil will save us and I 100% believe that.  And if we can protect it, then we have a chance to do better and offer people better.  
**0:06:08-0:06:11:**  We don't need more of anything, just better.  And I think that regenerative agriculture checks those boxes when we're talking about  minimizing tillage, minimizing soil disturbance, minimizing your use of fertilizers and reducing  
**0:06:28-0:06:32:**  all of the chemicals and things like that.  I think that they all check off boxes towards better food.  Right.  
**0:06:37-0:06:38:**  And I think that's really the goal.  I mean, we get to repair the earth, but the result is better food.  So fill in the sentence, regenerative agriculture is...  
**0:07:00-0:07:09:**  Reiterative agriculture is a way of helping with climate change and global warming by  no tilling on our farms and keeping the earth and all its ecosystem in place.  We can have more nutrient dense foods from this.  
**0:07:24-0:07:27:**  And that's what it means to me.  Tell everybody who you are and what your business is, what you're doing and where you're at.  It's Jennifer Koehr.  
**0:07:35-0:07:37:**  And I'm in Eastern Ohio.  Yeah.  So here I am with a business, a food company.  
**0:07:42-0:07:48:**  Koehr Foods International is the corporate name, doing business as Around the World Gourmet,  which is my food brand.  And now also doing business as Regenerative Mills.  
**0:07:54-0:08:00:**  So we are a manufacturer of gluten free vegan pizza crusts.  I have other recipes that I have...  That don't taste like it, I might add.  
**0:08:04-0:08:08:**  Yes, that does not taste like it.  Some of those can be a little taste challenged, if you will.  And I have had the good fortune to sample them many times and can attest that they really  
**0:08:19-0:08:20:**  can't tell the difference.  In fact, a number of your patrons don't even know that they're gluten free.  That's true.  
**0:08:25-0:08:31:**  Do you think it's something that consumers are looking for or that they can understand?  Yeah, I think that there are some consumers that definitely care about this.  We've seen that they've cared a lot about organic in the past.  
**0:08:43-0:08:48:**  And this is just the next step of them caring.  There's the people that care about your bodies and you are what you eat.  But the thing with the organic right now is that most of them still have to till because  
**0:08:58-0:09:00:**  of weeds control.  And I do believe that consumers are going to love this.  They're going to love the connection with the farmer.  
**0:09:06-0:09:12:**  They're going to love the fact that it's helping what they're actually able to by eating, let's  say our pizza.  We actually have a tagline, healthier for you and our planet and also save the planet  
**0:09:19-0:09:21:**  one pizza at a time.  I think they're going to feel like they're part of something bigger.  By now, you are probably wondering why isn't every brand using regeneratively grown ingredients?  
**0:09:36-0:09:41:**  That's a great question that you should definitely be asking your favorite brands.  Don't worry, that is another topic that we will tackle in the future.  But for now, let's get to our feature interview with Derek and Tanis Axston, regenerative  
**0:09:49-0:09:55:**  farmers from Saskatchewan, Canada, who grow 14 crops so very well and are in the process  of creating their own flour mill on the farm, which will produce baking flours of all different  kinds of grains that you can buy from them.  
**0:10:06-0:10:12:**  Well, hi Derek and Tanis, how are you guys?  We're great.  We're really good.  
**0:10:14-0:10:20:**  We just got some well-needed precipitation in the form of snow over the last couple of  days, but we'll take it.  Good.  
**0:10:23-0:10:29:**  Well, let everybody know, you guys are regenerative farmers have been doing it for quite a while,  but let everybody know where you farm and what you grow.  Sure, so we farm in Minton, Saskatchewan, which is, I guess, South Central Saskatchewan,  
**0:10:43-0:10:45:**  very near the US border.  Like basically, I tell people think about where Montana and North Dakota intersect,  and we're just north of that line.  
**0:10:54-0:11:02:**  And I don't know, we're a small grains operation, focusing mostly on heritage grains and grains  that we can market directly to end users and grains that we can add value to.  Oh gosh, do you want me to name specific?  
**0:11:13-0:11:16:**  Sorry, do you want me to name specific?  This gets too long.  Because it's like 14 different crops.  
**0:11:20-0:11:25:**  I'll help you out because I've talked to you several times, but you do a lot of with wheat  in ancient grains, right, and pulses, chickpeas, lentils, flax, a whole bunch of different  interesting things that could go into what bread or crackers or just all of those kinds  
**0:11:41-0:11:42:**  of things, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Things that we can, I don't know how to, it was grains that we thought we would, that  
**0:11:49-0:11:55:**  end users that would, good thing you can edit.  No, I don't know how to work, we grow Shady Nobody Else Grow basically.  It's like, what is it organic farmers?  
**0:12:07-0:12:12:**  It's there is a lot of confusion and people do think that we're organic and we're not.  But yeah, like spelt is definitely a big one we grow.  Yeah, golden flower.  
**0:12:17-0:12:18:**  That's right spelt.  Amaranth, do you grow any of that?  No, we don't.  
**0:12:20-0:12:21:**  Mustard, mustard seed.  That's right.  That's another one.  
**0:12:23-0:12:30:**  Yeah, a little mustard that we, yeah, so yellow mustard seed is a big one for us and we supply  that to the burlap and barrel.  That's the...  
**0:12:34-0:12:37:**  Camulina is our other oil seed.  And then yeah, some of the ancient grains like spelt, porridge, red fife.  Red fife, that was another one.  
**0:12:44-0:12:51:**  Yeah, we grow a hull-less oat, so like oats traditionally be hulled, but we have a variety  that was actually designed to be, it's like a naked oat and so it can be used.  The naked oat.  
**0:12:58-0:13:05:**  Yeah, the oat is really cool because it's actually, it's a really high protein, you  know, ultra traditionally 10 to 12 and these are like 18 to 20% protein.  So they'd fit really well like in a snack bar or any of those kinds of things, you know,  
**0:13:14-0:13:16:**  especially with all of the rage around protein right now.  Yeah.  And you guys are also working on, you already have a food grade seed cleaning facility and  
**0:13:21-0:13:26:**  you're working on a mill, so you'll be able to turn your crops into actual ingredients  and products that people can consume.  Yeah, no, for sure.  
**0:13:30-0:13:32:**  So we are, that's where we're sitting right now.  We're in my office and it's attached to our facility and yeah, this has been in operation  for 18 months, which has got us in some custom, some different customers kind of actually  
**0:13:42-0:13:44:**  almost all over the world now.  And the next step is we are, we are, the flour mill is going together right now.  Our crew is not here for a couple of weeks.  
**0:13:54-0:13:57:**  We're waiting for some components, but we're hoping to be grinding in June.  We have one confirmed flour customer.  It's a pretty good size volume for spelt flour that we're pretty excited about.  
**0:14:05-0:14:08:**  And so we really want to get grinding sooner than later.  And then, you know, Tanis has been talking to a whole bunch of different smaller customers  and yeah, but yeah, it is.  
**0:14:15-0:14:16:**  Yeah.  So we'll be, we're going to be able to package to start with in tote bags and in 20 and 50  pound bags.  
**0:14:22-0:14:27:**  We put a lot of thought and a lot of time into quality and food safety.  So metal detection, color sorter, all of it.  Yeah.  
**0:14:33-0:14:34:**  A lot.  Yeah.  So it's, we really want to make sure the things that leave here are not only nutritious and  
**0:14:37-0:14:38:**  safe.  So high quality.  That is great.  
**0:14:43-0:14:48:**  And I know you guys have been farming and doing regenerative farming for quite some  time.  So there's, there's a context there.  
**0:14:50-0:14:55:**  I just want people to understand that you aren't just, it didn't just come to this last year.  You've been, it's been a long journey, but you've been on it for a long time too.  Maybe how far back would you say you got started on this kind of this regenerative journey?  
**0:15:06-0:15:22:**  Well, the mindset shift happened in the mindset shift happened.  The shift in mindset happened in the summer of 2007.  The first time I met Dr. Doyenbeck that that's really easy to, I know that prior to that  
**0:15:32-0:15:37:**  we were, you know, commodity farmers didn't realize there was another world.  Do the same thing year after year.  Yeah.  
**0:15:40-0:15:47:**  You know, that was, you know, the only real metric we were trying to improve was yield.  So anyway, with that, you know, that first visit to Beck and everything that kind of  happened after that.  
**0:15:53-0:15:58:**  And it's, it's, it really is a journey and I don't, I keep telling people, I mean, we,  we still don't think we're there.  I don't think we'll ever be there.  
**0:16:02-0:16:05:**  I don't know where there is.  But we've improved, but we, there's definitely a lot of room for improvement.  All right.  
**0:16:11-0:16:14:**  So then that brings us up to, and that's one of the important things I think that we wanted  to do with this, this kind of series is to help people understand the regenerative agriculture,  what it is and what it is from people who are doing it instead of just the external  
**0:16:24-0:16:27:**  marketing that often gets thrown around there.  So what is your definition of regenerative agriculture?  You make it sound so easy.  
**0:16:32-0:16:40:**  Like, no, I know it's not clear on a lot of boards and committees, committees, and everyone  wants to know the definition.  And we knew this interview was coming.  
**0:16:43-0:16:49:**  So we've spent actually hours this morning sitting around the breakfast table, even with  our daughter, really discussing and thinking.  And so I had to make a few notes because it's really exciting.  
**0:16:57-0:17:01:**  We talked and we came up with more ideas of it's funny because we were all in the same  page, but we had different ideas of how we got there.  But one of the things we came up with first is there's no hard and fast rules because  
**0:17:10-0:17:16:**  it is a constant journey and it really comes down to the mindset and the motivation behind  your actions.  So we basically defined it as a philosophy of overarching principles that put soil first.  
**0:17:26-0:17:27:**  That's really good.  You know, starting with the soil, but impacting so much more health, happiness, community.  And yeah, that was kind of the hard work our conversation with that it isn't a thing as  
**0:17:42-0:17:43:**  much as it is.  It's a real philosophy and a mindset.  Well, that's great.  
**0:17:49-0:17:57:**  And I think so often the marketplace looks for these five things to certify or these  things to say you're not doing, to make sure to survive that you're not doing.  And I think there are some who want to put regenerative in that same path because that's  
**0:18:06-0:18:08:**  the model that everybody's used to.  So what in your discussion and your thinking about this, what are the dangers of that?  Even though there's danger of being too vague, if it's a philosophy, that's great.  
**0:18:17-0:18:23:**  But how do I know that you're really in it and on the path and somebody else who claims  they are maybe isn't.  So there are outcomes from that philosophy that you could measure maybe.  
**0:18:29-0:18:37:**  But what's the danger of maybe the very rigid path that is more concrete but has some challenges  too maybe?  Well, I just did this, or I guess I was recently quoted in an article that Sarah Delevasse  
**0:18:45-0:18:47:**  did for RFSI.  And my problem with any kind of certification is simply that people will ride the minimums  and then, and that's what got us when we were in the conversation this morning was got us  
**0:18:58-0:19:00:**  around talking about motivation.  What is your motivation?  Is it dollars and cents?  
**0:19:03-0:19:07:**  And what is the motivation for these certifications?  Is it so they can monetize what we're doing?  Or is it to actually get our, to move our product into consumer's hands?  
**0:19:17-0:19:24:**  Like, and I don't know the answer to that, but I think what is your motivation is, it's  something we didn't really consider a whole bunch before.  Yeah, I think we did in our own farm, our motivation was the soil.  
**0:19:32-0:19:36:**  And that's where we started because we knew that that was the most important resource  and that in the end would give us the biggest benefit in the end.  But yeah, we discussed a lot about motivation because it is why is the end for the consumer  
**0:19:50-0:19:53:**  or is it for yourself?  For us, it started with ourselves.  And then when we got excited about our product, we wanted to be able to offer it to someone  
**0:19:59-0:20:05:**  and we really thought, and I think it does to a certain extent, our story sells because  people, we grow it here, we clean it, we beg it, you know exactly where it came from.  But we're just talking about that.  
**0:20:11-0:20:17:**  And there's a lot of people, we find a lot of our products going into markets where people  are just so impressed with the quality of the product.  They don't know how it was grown, but the outcome is there.  
**0:20:24-0:20:26:**  And I think it's because of the practices.  But as far as measuring every little thing in between, it's very difficult.  We found that it was a really interesting conversation, because probably the company  
**0:20:38-0:20:44:**  that's going to be our largest customer in 2022 has no idea how we farm.  They just know that they really like our grains.  And it was interesting to us because you've seen those blind taste tests where they tell  
**0:20:52-0:20:58:**  you which one is more expensive than the other and then you want it to be better.  With these guys, there's no anticipation.  They're not judging us for how we farm or they just know that our products are really  
**0:21:06-0:21:07:**  good.  They're not seeing a label and being like, oh, this must be good, right?  Because it's labeled this.  
**0:21:12-0:21:14:**  They're looking at the actual product.  Well, because that goes back to, because some people, I think, will question is regenerative  real or does it make a real difference?  
**0:21:22-0:21:27:**  But if you're doing all these things that really enhance the soil and then you have  more nutrient density and more minerals are getting into the crop, and then that mineral  affects the taste, right?  
**0:21:32-0:21:34:**  It affects the quality and affect all these things.  So in theory, at least, you would have a better product, not just in some ways that you'd  have to detect in a lab, but in ways that people could actually detect that would go  
**0:21:46-0:21:49:**  hand in hand with them being able to have a better market.  Yeah.  And we've been doing that too.  
**0:21:52-0:21:57:**  You know, just like you've got four or five years of data on nutrient density testing,  we've been doing glyphosate, AMPA, residue testing, and all of those things have been  the outcomes we want, but it really hasn't been the big driver of sales that we expected  
**0:22:07-0:22:09:**  it or hoped it would be.  Yeah.  We've talked about how it goes even beyond that for us when we shifted our mindset to  
**0:22:17-0:22:24:**  focus on the soil, which really involved all these regenerative practices.  You know, we've seen improvements in our soil, improvements in our plant health, grains that  have high nutrient densities, which ultimately can improve people's health.  
**0:22:36-0:22:41:**  But then beyond that, we were able, you know, we've expanded on the farm and we've been  able to employ more people, have more people come into our community.  So by starting by trying to build our small biological communities, you can't even see  
**0:22:52-0:22:57:**  it's having a huge impact on our community and our entire lives.  That's one of the things that I've been gauging is a factor of success or an indicator of  success for us is we recently had two of our employees buy homes in our community that  
**0:23:12-0:23:14:**  are going to raise families in our community.  That to me, that's an indicator of success.  And when we say community, we're talking about a town of 50 people or less.  
**0:23:23-0:23:25:**  You know, who is a lot?  Yeah, that's right.  Young people with, you know, we're starting families.  
**0:23:30-0:23:33:**  That's exactly what we need in our community so that it can survive.  Yeah.  And we needed these jobs to be able to do that, to be able to stay in a lifestyle that  
**0:23:39-0:23:45:**  they maybe would have liked, but, you know, without additional economic opportunity couldn't.  Well, I want to ask too, so you talked a little bit about, but so that's your definition of  regenerative.  
**0:23:52-0:23:54:**  Tell people more about how it is that you practice that.  And I know it's not just a set of practices, but it is also practices that matter.  And so how do you, using that philosophy, how does that translate into how you farm?  
**0:24:04-0:24:09:**  Well, I guess start with diversity.  You know, years back before we started this mind shift, we were, I don't know, down to  about four different crops.  
**0:24:16-0:24:19:**  So I mean, a diverse rotation.  That includes, you know, the cover crops, inner crops.  We've planted pollinator strips because as you increase your plant diversity, you're  
**0:24:29-0:24:34:**  increasing your biological community underneath the ground and above as far as insects and  pollinators.  Another one would be, you know, just the low disturbance.  
**0:24:40-0:24:43:**  We've worked really hard to build good soil structure.  So the last thing we want to do is disrupt it.  So we try to disturb it as little as possible and keep it covered so that the soil is protected.  
**0:24:54-0:25:00:**  We do control traffic farming also, which has really helped reduce compaction.  And once again, it's less disturbance on the soil.  No, make you go.  
**0:25:07-0:25:12:**  Yeah, I think it's disturbance in a really broad term.  Like, so I mean, with that, you know, like Hannah said about compaction, you know, that  all sort of fits under that same umbrella, you know, low disturbance seeding, you know,  
**0:25:22-0:25:27:**  even as far as like the inputs we use, you know, we're pretty conscious about the type  of inputs we use.  And we've made a big shift like from, you know, back then of more synthetic base to  
**0:25:33-0:25:36:**  definitely a predominantly biological base.  Now we still use some herbicides.  We just, we're about to do delivery of a sprayer that uses some really, really new tech that's  
**0:25:44-0:25:48:**  going to allow us to reduce like herbicide loads by probably 60 or 70%.  You know, so that's a disturbance rate.  So we've invested heavily in that because we don't think we're not going to get, we're  
**0:25:58-0:26:00:**  not going to be organic, we're not going to do tillage.  So we have to find that place in between where we can get our disturbance, right.  So that's all of those things as low as possible, but still have good outcomes.  
**0:26:09-0:26:13:**  So, you know, control our weeds and, you know, build our systems.  Well, and I think it's important to explain to people that don't really understand, you  know, a lot about like the tillage piece and the organic piece.  
**0:26:20-0:26:22:**  And they hear you say, well, we're not going to be organic.  And they don't maybe understand that that's a choice because the trade-offs are ones you  don't want.  
**0:26:28-0:26:32:**  And so maybe share more about what you'd have to do to be organic and the trade-offs that  that would mean that would be against your motto, loyal to the soil.  Yeah.  
**0:26:38-0:26:42:**  So, you know, so I mean, you know, I obviously people are talking about this new soil health  pillar that they call context, which I made a joke that I think the way in back was using  context before it was cool, because it was probably the first thing you taught me was  
**0:26:52-0:26:57:**  to look at your native systems and use that, you know, when you're planning your cropping  systems.  So we live in short grass prairie, low rainfall, we're 250 to 300 mills annually, including  
**0:27:05-0:27:06:**  snow.  So that's, that's one month in some places and our growing season is short.  So we can't do the spring covers and the, you know, the roller crimper that's enabling  
**0:27:19-0:27:22:**  some guys to do the organic no till.  That just isn't an option.  So that option basically for us as far as weed control and leads us to tillage.  
**0:27:29-0:27:33:**  And we're very hilly here.  We're in fragile soils or, you know, I've told people lots of times that we're on the  edge of where they stop breaking land for a reason.  
**0:27:40-0:27:44:**  And maybe some of the stuff where farming shouldn't, you know, shouldn't be under annual  cultivation, but we are building soil.  So we're, we know it's possible.  
**0:27:48-0:27:53:**  But yeah, it's the tillage thing is that it would be a real challenge.  We've got to control your weed somehow, you know, and maybe one day we'll get to the point  where our soil is somehow balanced and we don't grow weeds.  
**0:28:01-0:28:04:**  But like I told you earlier, we're a long way from that.  You know, we've got a lot of room to improve.  Because I think it was Dwayne Beck that said you don't see earthquakes.  
**0:28:11-0:28:15:**  You don't see it's like an earthquake tillage is like an earthquake that you send through  the land every year.  And you don't see that in nature.  
**0:28:20-0:28:24:**  Like, you know, nature isn't tilling itself up in order to plant a new crop.  He said it more eloquently.  I can't remember how he said it.  
**0:28:29-0:28:31:**  It's a traumatic, it's a traumatic event.  You know, it's a once in a lifetime or once in a century kind of event.  You know, well, it's kind of, I know, I've thought of it like this, if you're at home  
**0:28:41-0:28:46:**  and a windstorm blows your house down, chances are you're going to stay home and deal with  that and not go to work that day.  And if that keeps happening over and over again, you might just move away or maybe you'll  
**0:28:52-0:28:53:**  die.  Right.  So that's, I guess I think that's kind of the...  
**0:28:55-0:29:02:**  That's what the microbes are dealing with when their environment is, yeah.  And I know we were talking about this this morning too with tillage, like it's one of  those things that I've seen farms who have some tillage in their practices who are doing  
**0:29:14-0:29:15:**  a lot better job than some no-till farms.  So it's kind of back to, that's why it's so hard to define these things because, and back  to your motivation of, and I guess your context for lack of a better term, that it's what  
**0:29:29-0:29:30:**  else are you doing?  You know, how many practices are you using and where are you trying to get to?  You know, what are your end results?  
**0:29:37-0:29:40:**  So it's so hard to...  There are many roads to run, I guess, maybe that's the one.  Well, it seems like...  
**0:29:45-0:29:46:**  Oh, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I think most farmers, if not all, have well intentions and may feel that they are doing  
**0:29:57-0:30:03:**  regenerative practices, but to us, it's not just the one practice and this is, you know,  I'm no-till, so I'm a regenerative farmer.  There's always, what else can I do?  
**0:30:10-0:30:14:**  Because we were no-till for a lot of years and we did see improvement in our soil, but  we hit a plateau, right?  There's so much more that can be done.  
**0:30:20-0:30:26:**  And that was one thing, yeah, we talked about is just the motivation behind it and the constant  journey, not just, yeah, check, done, right?  It's funny because from the time I first met back in 2007 and he showed me how water can  
**0:30:36-0:30:39:**  actually run, go in the soil and not run off.  And then the first time I was at Gibbs and he showed us the difference in management.  It wasn't about labels, you know, and not until, I don't know what year it was when  
**0:30:49-0:30:53:**  this word started circulating more, you know, you know, middle, I don't know, 2015, I don't  know what year it was when it started to become a popular word that I guess we realized this  is what we fall into, but it was, for us, it was never about trying to fit into a category.  
**0:31:05-0:31:10:**  It was just, I knew that where we live, if we don't do this, we're not going to be able  to build resilience and get ourselves through some of these really dry years, really wet  years because the one thing that's been constant has been lack of being constant.  
**0:31:21-0:31:27:**  You know, our rain comes hard and fast when we do get it, we generally get enough moisture  to grow a crop.  It's just when does it come and how does it come and are we able to capture it?  
**0:31:33-0:31:35:**  You know, so that was, that's the driver.  I mean, it's the soil.  And I mean, it's, it's really awesome, but now that there's sort of a market space for  
**0:31:44-0:31:48:**  that falls into what we do, you know, and I think then we're excited to be, to participate  in that, but it's funny now how guys are, I want to participate in that market.  So what's the minimum amount of things I have to do to participate in that market.  
**0:31:58-0:32:00:**  You know, it's a little bit of what's happened organic, right?  And that's, that's why we're so hesitant to put labels on these things is because there's  going to be people riding the minimum train.  
**0:32:07-0:32:10:**  It's like, well, I'm regenerative because I do these four things, right?  So that's, what's on the list.  Wow.  
**0:32:13-0:32:14:**  That's not what it's about, right?  It's about the soil.  Because you were doing it before there was a name and you would do it even if there was  
**0:32:20-0:32:21:**  no name.  That's basically years ago, Derek speaking at a conference and Jill Clapperton was there  and Derek talked about our farm and she got up and she said, I don't know what you guys,  
**0:32:32-0:32:34:**  you know, what it's called, but someday it'll have a name.  Maybe it'll be new conventional.  We were talking about that and we never really thought about it, but I mean, it's our human  
**0:32:41-0:32:42:**  nature.  We want to define and label things so that we can understand it.  Yeah.  
**0:32:46-0:32:47:**  Yeah.  It was a note along the planes at the, I don't know what it's called, but the thing after  the AIM symposium.  
**0:32:54-0:32:55:**  Yeah.  I remember Jill saying that and people who hadn't used the regenerative word so long  ago.  
**0:33:03-0:33:08:**  And there are, there's lots of people like, you know, with the motivation to improve the  resource.  That being said, I like the word regenerative.  
**0:33:12-0:33:13:**  It's exciting.  It gives hope.  And it's not just conventional, right?  
**0:33:17-0:33:18:**  Like the same thing.  It is descriptive of what, I mean, it's regenerating the soil base, the resource and from that  other things are regenerated too.  
**0:33:27-0:33:28:**  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it's going to be interesting to watch how it develops because I mean, it's obviously  
**0:33:33-0:33:37:**  it's going to develop and it's becoming a thing.  And how many labels show up.  I was just, we were looking at one last night, Whole30, which is kind of a diet.  
**0:33:43-0:33:46:**  I've seen that Whole30 has a label now.  You can have a Whole30 approved product.  So many labels on the packages that all of these labels.  
**0:33:54-0:33:58:**  You won't have enough room for what it actually is.  Well, doesn't that speak to the fact that, you know, there is such a disconnect between  people and where the food is grown.  
**0:34:04-0:34:09:**  And while there is a desire to know that it's hard and people are busy and they don't really  want to spend that much time.  And so then the label serves as a stand in for, well, someone else has looked at these  
**0:34:16-0:34:20:**  things and that's better than nobody looking at it.  And so, you know, if people are able to actually have a direct connection, like what's so exciting,  what you're doing is that you're growing it and processing it and packaging it so that  
**0:34:30-0:34:37:**  eventually people can, you know, know as much as they want to know about everything that  goes into it.  And that's just so rare because the supply chain is so separated into each separate part  
**0:34:44-0:34:48:**  and each along the way you lose information and you lose, you know.  So I don't know if, are you already in the process of having a way for consumers to follow  you or to people or brands you might work with?  
**0:34:58-0:35:03:**  Kind of how do they learn about more about what you're doing and how you're continuing  to evolve?  Yeah, well, we've got a website, accidentfarms.ca and we are on social media, Instagram.  
**0:35:15-0:35:18:**  I don't know.  I'm not even sure.  We have an open door policy as well, so there are people who are welcome to come and we  
**0:35:25-0:35:26:**  give a lot.  We have official field days, but we also have a lot of people to just come and show up and  we always make time for people.  
**0:35:31-0:35:36:**  I mean, that's the reason that we do what we do and we have an open door policy because  folks like the Walker-Dwayne Beck and Gabe Brown and Jill Klaper-Din and Christine Jones  and all these people took time for us, right?  
**0:35:45-0:35:52:**  We're able to share some knowledge and we were able to kind of take a little bit from  everybody and put together what we have today.  But I don't, yeah, I'm on LinkedIn.  
**0:35:59-0:36:00:**  I'm not sure.  It's interesting.  We're going to figure it out.  
**0:36:03-0:36:08:**  It doesn't seem a little salesy to me.  Your website itself, do you have videos about showing what you're doing on the farm and  those kinds of things?  
**0:36:15-0:36:18:**  Yeah, we've got, yeah, we're working on it.  I did want to make sure and catch, because you guys do some really cool stuff with composting  and making teas that you actually apply to the land.  
**0:36:25-0:36:28:**  So maybe Tannis, just share a little bit about that.  Yeah, well, when we first started shifting the way we farm and understanding that there's  all this life in the soil and realizing that we've done a lot of damage the way we've farmed  
**0:36:39-0:36:43:**  in the past, we wanted to be able to restore some of that biology.  So we started composting, which is really exciting because it's basically what everyone  considers waste products, you know, manure from feed beds, our grain screenings from  
**0:36:55-0:36:59:**  the plant, old bales no one's using.  So by composting all that and coming up with a diverse compost full of microbes, it's really  exciting and it's a great way to take byproducts and make nutrients that can be available to  
**0:37:13-0:37:14:**  our land.  We haven't been able to make enough compost to spread across all of our acres.  So we make a compost extract, which is basically just washing all the microbes out of the compost  
**0:37:25-0:37:26:**  into water.  And we put that down with every acre we seed so that it's with the seed and it gives the,  puts a little bit of biology back into the soil.  
**0:37:36-0:37:43:**  And with that, we add some biological foods to kind of give it a jumpstart.  So we use our use of analysis from previous crops to sort of build our program going forward.  And it's been a pretty good fit, you know, that's back to outcome testing again, right?  
**0:37:52-0:37:57:**  So the outcomes of those crops are what helps us build things going forward and helps us  make decisions.  So it seems like it's kind of a mix of the philosophy and the motivation on the bigger  
**0:38:03-0:38:09:**  end and then measuring outcomes to see how you're progressing, you know, as a way of  instead of a checklist of practices, did you do these five things?  But you are always, I know you're checking the outcomes every year and comparing them  
**0:38:17-0:38:18:**  against each other.  And so you're able to see benefit, right?  Yeah, I think that's, that's pretty much, you know, probably the easiest way to describe  
**0:38:26-0:38:32:**  it, you know, and we own our land, you know, so I've had this conversation before, it's  probably easier for us, because we know we're going to have it for the next foreseeable  future unless I do something really stupid.  
**0:38:40-0:38:44:**  And that gives us, you know, the ability because it's a slow growth, like it's not a, you know,  we were talking about metaphors, right?  And it's not like, you know, with exercise, right?  
**0:38:48-0:38:51:**  You don't work out once and you're not an unfortunate, right?  This takes time.  You know, and if you need to see results tomorrow, this may not be for you.  
**0:38:58-0:39:00:**  Especially as we're dealing with so many variables.  I mean, you can do everything perfectly and you get three years of drought, and you're  not going to see outcomes at the time.  
**0:39:10-0:39:14:**  If you're able, I think if you have, you know, the soil covered and a lot of these principles  covered, you're going to mitigate a lot of the damage, but you're not going to have a  bumper crop just because you follow these principles.  
**0:39:21-0:39:22:**  Right.  Yeah, well then, right, and is yield the only metric you're measuring?  Or what are you measuring?  
**0:39:28-0:39:29:**  And why are you measuring?  In our current conventional system, that seems to be the, you know, that's the first question  you do at the coffee shop, you know, what did it yield?  
**0:39:38-0:39:40:**  That's the big comparison.  It's a big mind shift, not, you know, quality over quantity or, you know, there's so many,  or how much did it cost you to grow that crop?  
**0:39:48-0:39:52:**  Your yield is higher than mine, but I may have made more money.  You know, there's so many variables, but it's funny how yield is all a lot of people measure.  All right.  
**0:40:00-0:40:04:**  Well, we've talked a lot about all of this now and coming back around, I'm going to ask  you to complete the sentence, regenerative agriculture is?  Well, for me, regenerative ag is constant improvement, you know, of soil and mindset  
**0:40:16-0:40:21:**  and community and health and happiness, all of those things, you know, and then I guess  that, you know, I guess in the outcome for us, one of the big ones is resilience.  I, you know, that's and that same thing is back to resilience of soil and, you know,  
**0:40:31-0:40:37:**  business all of it's like from the outside looking in, I guess that's, I don't, I mean,  yeah, I can go kind of a few different ways, but that's,  Yeah, and I totally agree.  
**0:40:41-0:40:46:**  And I mean, I guess that's where I tried to sum it all up into our little more, our little  motto of loyal to the soil.  Yeah, it's a great motto.  
**0:40:51-0:40:55:**  It's, you know, everything we do, how does it affect the soil?  And sometimes it's not maybe going to have a positive effect, but how can we have as  little of a detrimental impact as it is possible so that we can be moving forward?  
**0:41:05-0:41:11:**  Yeah, like something that really kind of struck this winter, I took a leadership course, which  in itself was an amazing experience.  But one of the things we talked about, because it's a lot of inward looking and a lot of,  
**0:41:18-0:41:23:**  you know, self, but was like, when we're looking at building and looking at measuring success  and improvement, think about sheets of paper.  That's kind of, you know, is it, is it better or worse than that?  
**0:41:29-0:41:30:**  I mean, that's what we're in.  Same thing with the soil.  I mean, it's not a, it doesn't do that.  
**0:41:34-0:41:39:**  If it does good for you and that's great, but for us year in and year out with the weather  challenges we face, if we can be profitable and improve the resource in the same year,  that's a win, you know?  
**0:41:45-0:41:50:**  Cause I think what happens sometimes is profitability comes at the cost of the resource and people  don't talk about that.  So at some point, I mean, I've had some really good conversations with, we're working with  
**0:41:57-0:41:58:**  a company called TerraMera.  They're a tech company out of Vancouver that's working on measuring soil carbon, I guess  is kind of the big thing they're working on, but we've had their teams over while they  
**0:42:06-0:42:09:**  were actually just here again last week.  And this Brian Smith is the, he's the VP of regenerative finance.  So they get some relatively large company.  
**0:42:17-0:42:21:**  We were talking about how at some point, I think on financial statements, we're going  to see a column for like inherit soil value, or I don't know what you'd call it, but so  at least, you know, if it's going to come in the form of carbon trading or environmental  
**0:42:30-0:42:32:**  credits or whatever that is, I don't know what it's going to be.  It's going to be something if farmers can understand then that there is value that they  can see and that's tangible in soil, then maybe it becomes priority.  
**0:42:43-0:42:48:**  So yeah, just helping people to understand the complexity and the trade-offs and yet  there are ways that you can still bound those like, you know, you mentioned using pesticides,  but you test for pesticide residues.  
**0:42:55-0:43:00:**  So you're using it in a limited way and because the soil is so healthy, you don't need to  use much and it's not actually on the food that you're in the residue isn't, you can  test for that.  
**0:43:05-0:43:11:**  You know, so that's, I think what's so complicated that people, as you said, people don't like  complicated, but maybe that's something we should be more suspicious of black and white.  You know, it's funny to be talking this morning about like, let's look at this from a consumer's  
**0:43:20-0:43:21:**  view.  Like, I mean, it's really easy for us to be stuck in our farmer view and you should like  my spelt.  
**0:43:25-0:43:29:**  I don't know why you don't because it's the best.  Like from a consumer's view, it is, it is confusing and daunting and you can see why,  you know, why organic has got a following because it's like the least are measuring  
**0:43:38-0:43:39:**  something right.  And it needs to have a little bit of traceability, you know, you know, in some products.  So that's, it's understandable why that regenerative is looking to do the certifications.  
**0:43:49-0:43:53:**  I mean, from a consumer standpoint, I think it makes sense.  I mean, it does.  It's just, you know, my concern is how many certifications are we going to have and what  
**0:43:59-0:44:01:**  are they going to be the differences in the metrics that they measure?  And it's just, they're going to,  You can't certify a mindset.  
**0:44:04-0:44:05:**  You can't certify a philosophy.  I mean, that's the, that's the hard, if it is that, if that is what it is, then yeah,  then that part gets lost.  
**0:44:13-0:44:18:**  My daughter said, you know, like we're talking about regenerating agriculture, but the food  system really needs regenerating too.  And we'll see, maybe that'll be her goal.  
**0:44:24-0:44:28:**  She goes off to university this fall and is taking international food business.  So hopefully she can make those connections.  And yeah, because I, I do, I feel sorry as a consumer.  
**0:44:35-0:44:36:**  I couldn't imagine.  I mean, we're lucky to grow a lot of the food that we eat or know people who do grow it.  So it's, it's very comforting, but yeah, you go into a store and it's a lot of choices.  
**0:44:47-0:44:48:**  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anything else you wanted to add before we go?  
**0:44:51-0:44:56:**  I guess the only other thing we talked about was the importance of education, you know,  in everything.  And that's, we're constantly trying to learn and trying to teach anything we've learned  
**0:45:02-0:45:09:**  to others also, whether it's field days or we're on different boards or the more we learn,  I think the better job everyone can do.  Yeah.  
**0:45:12-0:45:18:**  We really enjoy the field days that they're a lot of work and they're a bit exhausting,  but you know, because our year is so short in the first place, you know, but we've talked  about it.  
**0:45:23-0:45:24:**  It would be really neat.  We enjoy it like having farmer-based field days, but it would be really cool to start  doing consumer field days and just see how that goes and see, you know, what the reception  
**0:45:33-0:45:38:**  to that is, what people think is, you know, honestly, I mean, obviously without consumers,  we don't exist.  So, it would be neat to get their ideas and, you know, what's important to consumers and,  
**0:45:45-0:45:51:**  you know, really, you know, and what makes them want to purchase this over that or why  they don't know about us or what we can do better.  All of those things.  
**0:45:55-0:45:57:**  I mean, I think that would be really cool to do.  Yeah, I think I would too.  That'd be great.  
**0:45:59-0:46:01:**  All right, Will.  This is great.  Thank you so much for sharing your story and your perspective with us.  
**0:46:06-0:46:07:**  Thanks for having us.  Thanks for having us.  You brought up a lot of good conversations, things we talk about in passing all the time,  
**0:46:12-0:46:17:**  but when you really sit down and come up with something, it was, our daughter would be excited  to see this because she was wondering how all these thoughts, they were actually going  to come together.

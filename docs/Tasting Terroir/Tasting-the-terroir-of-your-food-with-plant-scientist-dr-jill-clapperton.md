### Tasting Terroir  (Wed, 17 Aug 2022 20:00:00)
**0:00:00-0:00:21:**  How does the health of the soil affect the flavor of our food?  
**0:00:21-0:00:27:**  How do the farmers' choices, the weather, the soil microbiome, that world underground,  
**0:00:27-0:00:29:**  shape the taste of our food?  
**0:00:29-0:00:34:**  Who are the amazing people growing food in this regenerative way, and how can we taste  
**0:00:34-0:00:37:**  the difference that they make?  
**0:00:37-0:00:42:**  These and many other questions are what we explore in our podcast, Tasting Tarroir, a  
**0:00:42-0:00:47:**  journey into the connection between healthy soil and the flavor of food.  
**0:00:47-0:00:54:**  I'm your host, Sarah Harper.  
**0:00:54-0:00:58:**  Farmers in general, they would tell you that when they have good soils, the flavor of their  
**0:00:58-0:01:01:**  crops and the quality of the crops reflects it.  
**0:01:01-0:01:08:**  We know that the quality of the crops, from a growing standpoint, I know that when I get  
**0:01:08-0:01:11:**  my soils right, my crops are reflected.  
**0:01:11-0:01:13:**  The quality of my crops are reflected in that.  
**0:01:13-0:01:15:**  I see healthier crops.  
**0:01:15-0:01:18:**  My yields are good.  
**0:01:18-0:01:22:**  Whether it's wheat berries or whether it's seeds or whatever it is, it's filled out really  
**0:01:22-0:01:23:**  beautifully.  
**0:01:23-0:01:25:**  The harvest goes well.  
**0:01:25-0:01:31:**  The question is, and we know from some of our mineral nutrient density work that we've  
**0:01:31-0:01:37:**  been doing with Rise of Tara that we already know that we do differ wildly in the concentration  
**0:01:37-0:01:42:**  of minerals in these grains, but that as our soils get better and better and better, we  
**0:01:42-0:01:45:**  see more and more and more of them using less and less and less.  
**0:01:45-0:01:48:**  We're like, okay, so there's something to this.  
**0:01:48-0:01:51:**  Now the question is, does it bake differently?  
**0:01:51-0:01:53:**  Does it taste differently?  
**0:01:53-0:01:57:**  In the case of Diana, who's in our network, does it make pasta differently?  
**0:01:57-0:01:59:**  The answer is yes, it does.  
**0:01:59-0:02:02:**  We are super excited to launch this podcast.  
**0:02:02-0:02:07:**  In our first episode, we will explain what we mean by the ability to taste the terroir  
**0:02:07-0:02:12:**  of your food, how this concept is directly linked to the health of the land and the decisions  
**0:02:12-0:02:17:**  farmers make in growing food, and many other great insights from topsoil health expert  
**0:02:17-0:02:22:**  Dr. Jill Cloperton, my co-host on this food journey.  
**0:02:22-0:02:24:**  Quick background on me, Sarah Harper.  
**0:02:24-0:02:29:**  I'm a regenerative agriculture policy expert who has worked for over 20 years in the public,  
**0:02:29-0:02:35:**  nonprofit and private sectors on what is now called regenerative agriculture.  
**0:02:35-0:02:40:**  From my experiences working in the US Senate on agricultural and environmental policy to  
**0:02:40-0:02:46:**  building bridges between farmers and some environmentalists to doing consulting work  
**0:02:46-0:02:51:**  on corporate sustainability policy, I've had the opportunity to meet and learn from some  
**0:02:51-0:02:57:**  of the best farmers in the world who are focused on building up soil health and working with  
**0:02:57-0:03:02:**  nature rather than against her to do it.  
**0:03:02-0:03:07:**  Joining me as my co-host on this podcast is my dear friend and mentor, Dr. Jill Cloperton,  
**0:03:07-0:03:11:**  a soil health scientist and plant physiologist.  
**0:03:11-0:03:16:**  Through her company, Risotera, Jill provides expert advice to farmers around the world  
**0:03:16-0:03:19:**  to help regenerate their farm and pasture land.  
**0:03:19-0:03:24:**  She helps farmers understand and apply the science of using plants to solve soil health  
**0:03:24-0:03:30:**  problems, planting with purpose instead of depending only on artificial inputs.  
**0:03:30-0:03:35:**  She also measures the nutrient density of food and is researching the link between the  
**0:03:35-0:03:41:**  practices on the farm and the nutrient density of the food it creates over time.  
**0:03:41-0:03:48:**  All of this expertise is a great background to then dive into how these practices and  
**0:03:48-0:03:53:**  the place where food is grown affects its flavor.  
**0:03:53-0:03:57:**  Join us as we start this journey.  
**0:03:57-0:04:00:**  Well, hi, Jill.  
**0:04:00-0:04:03:**  Hi, my friend.  
**0:04:03-0:04:04:**  How are you?  
**0:04:04-0:04:06:**  You know, this is a great day, Sarah.  
**0:04:06-0:04:07:**  It really is.  
**0:04:07-0:04:08:**  It's finally cooled off.  
**0:04:08-0:04:10:**  So that's the best thing.  
**0:04:10-0:04:16:**  Yes, we've been cooking this up, this podcast idea for quite some time.  
**0:04:16-0:04:23:**  And I'm so excited to get to do it with you, really bringing together the science of food,  
**0:04:23-0:04:29:**  the flavor of food, how food gets its flavor and exploring all these things with people  
**0:04:29-0:04:34:**  like you who are scientists, who understand the science of it, and the farmers who are  
**0:04:34-0:04:38:**  doing the practices in the ground that are making a change and the chefs that are seeing  
**0:04:38-0:04:42:**  the change and just all these different people that you've assembled in your community, your  
**0:04:42-0:04:47:**  online community, and being able to bring some of that knowledge out to the people that  
**0:04:47-0:04:50:**  the consumers are really interested in this kind of stuff.  
**0:04:50-0:04:56:**  Yeah, I'm not going to tell you that as scientists, we know a whole lot about, you know, how we  
**0:04:56-0:05:02:**  and I think we know about how we taste food and whatnot, but I don't think as scientists,  
**0:05:02-0:05:09:**  we really understand how we that connection between soils and taste and nutrition all  
**0:05:09-0:05:10:**  that well.  
**0:05:10-0:05:15:**  That's an area that we're still working on, which is kind of unbelievable, but it is true.  
**0:05:15-0:05:21:**  That gets us to our podcast and our podcast is called Tasting Terroir.  
**0:05:21-0:05:27:**  And by that, we are describing all the different elements that go into making distinct, flavorful,  
**0:05:27-0:05:28:**  healthy food.  
**0:05:28-0:05:33:**  So to taste is to experience something, to know it, you know, beyond just the academic  
**0:05:33-0:05:38:**  and terroir refers to the place where something is grown, the impact that the conditions of  
**0:05:38-0:05:43:**  a place have on its development, whether it's weather or the type of soil or all those things,  
**0:05:43-0:05:49:**  the practices done by the farmer, how it became what it is, the unique flavor of it.  
**0:05:49-0:05:54:**  So this uniqueness is very much connected to minerals in the soil and many, many factors,  
**0:05:54-0:05:55:**  as we've talked about.  
**0:05:55-0:06:01:**  But with that in mind, as a plant physiologist and a soil scientist, what do you mean when  
**0:06:01-0:06:05:**  we talk about tasting terroir beyond just wine?  
**0:06:05-0:06:10:**  Yeah, it's beyond wine.  
**0:06:10-0:06:14:**  The question for me was, can we taste?  
**0:06:14-0:06:18:**  Can we taste what we do with the soil?  
**0:06:18-0:06:20:**  Can we taste a healthy soil?  
**0:06:20-0:06:27:**  Can we tell if I grew all the same varieties and, you know, five different soils side by  
**0:06:27-0:06:32:**  side that were all treated differently, could I taste the difference?  
**0:06:32-0:06:33:**  Wow.  
**0:06:33-0:06:39:**  Like, could I taste that I grew this plant in this way?  
**0:06:39-0:06:41:**  Could I taste that I grew this plant in this way?  
**0:06:41-0:06:45:**  I think the answer is yes.  
**0:06:45-0:06:52:**  I do hear it from, you know, the people that have vineyards and the winemakers, the vintners.  
**0:06:52-0:06:58:**  You know, you hear from them that if we grow different cover crops between the vines, we  
**0:06:58-0:07:03:**  can taste that subtle difference in the flavor of the grapes.  
**0:07:03-0:07:09:**  I think scientifically, I think I understand how this could happen.  
**0:07:09-0:07:14:**  I've been thinking about this a lot since we decided we were going to do this podcast.  
**0:07:14-0:07:18:**  And I'm like, okay, so how does this actually work?  
**0:07:18-0:07:23:**  And I think that terroir refers to different regions too.  
**0:07:23-0:07:30:**  If we go back to that wine terroir, then you can grow the same grape in different areas  
**0:07:30-0:07:37:**  of the world and you will taste the regionality of where that grape is being grown.  
**0:07:37-0:07:41:**  Because the parent soils are very different.  
**0:07:41-0:07:43:**  So the minerals in that soil are very different.  
**0:07:43-0:07:50:**  So the mineralities of the food are going to reflect, to a certain extent, the parent  
**0:07:50-0:07:52:**  material.  
**0:07:52-0:07:56:**  Now with crops that we grow, we fertilize them and we add things to them.  
**0:07:56-0:08:02:**  So we are going to not always reflect that terroir perfectly because we've added things  
**0:08:02-0:08:07:**  to them, you know, to help them grow and to make sure that they have all the nutrition  
**0:08:07-0:08:08:**  that we think we need.  
**0:08:08-0:08:12:**  And certainly to add all the nutrition that we think the plant needs.  
**0:08:12-0:08:16:**  However, we still have the climate.  
**0:08:16-0:08:19:**  And how does the climate affect things?  
**0:08:19-0:08:24:**  So if we think about, let's even think about grass-fed beef, for example.  
**0:08:24-0:08:30:**  Is the grass, is grass-fed beef, if I took the same genetics and I put them in different  
**0:08:30-0:08:36:**  regions of North America, they're going to taste different.  
**0:08:36-0:08:42:**  I know that beef grown on the East Coast tastes different from the beef grown in Kansas.  
**0:08:42-0:08:44:**  I know it does.  
**0:08:44-0:08:49:**  And I know that the beef grown in Argentina tastes very different from the beef that I've  
**0:08:49-0:08:51:**  eaten in other places of the world.  
**0:08:51-0:08:55:**  Now, does that require it to be all the way grass-finished or does that even affect?  
**0:08:55-0:08:58:**  And grass-finished totally makes a difference.  
**0:08:58-0:09:00:**  I mean, it totally makes a difference.  
**0:09:00-0:09:06:**  And now we know from some of the work that's coming forward on multi-species pastures that  
**0:09:06-0:09:09:**  multi-species pastures also change things.  
**0:09:09-0:09:16:**  So we think about milk, for example, that if cows are fed multi-species pastures every  
**0:09:16-0:09:21:**  day, that their milk quality changes, the quality of the fat changes, the color of the  
**0:09:21-0:09:22:**  fat.  
**0:09:22-0:09:28:**  And that affects how the smell of the milk, which also affects how delicious it is and  
**0:09:28-0:09:31:**  how it stimulates our taste buds and things like that.  
**0:09:31-0:09:34:**  And that's all based on the plants that we grew up with.  
**0:09:34-0:09:42:**  We know that if we feed dairy cattle too many brassicas or too many flax seeds or things  
**0:09:42-0:09:47:**  like that, then we start to have sort of sulfate flavors in the milk or we have nutty flavors  
**0:09:47-0:09:48:**  in the milk.  
**0:09:48-0:09:51:**  Once again, that's tasting the terroir.  
**0:09:51-0:09:54:**  You're tasting what you've been doing, your practice.  
**0:09:54-0:10:00:**  So we're adopting the term terroir a little bit to mean how we're actually growing things.  
**0:10:00-0:10:03:**  So can we taste practice?  
**0:10:03-0:10:05:**  Can we taste how we grew it?  
**0:10:05-0:10:07:**  Can we taste how we fed it?  
**0:10:07-0:10:09:**  Can we taste all these things?  
**0:10:09-0:10:12:**  Is that reflected in the ultimate outcome?  
**0:10:12-0:10:14:**  And I think the answer is yes.  
**0:10:14-0:10:15:**  I think we measure it.  
**0:10:15-0:10:19:**  Do we know what we measure is reflected in the tastiness?  
**0:10:19-0:10:20:**  No.  
**0:10:20-0:10:25:**  We don't actually know that that's reflected in the tastiness because we know that people  
**0:10:25-0:10:30:**  have different tastes and that everybody can taste the same thing and they can taste it  
**0:10:30-0:10:36:**  all very differently because of just our own genetics.  
**0:10:36-0:10:45:**  And a lot of it has to do with the way we grew up and our images of things, our search  
**0:10:45-0:10:46:**  image.  
**0:10:46-0:10:50:**  So when we look at something, we go, oh, yeah, I wouldn't buy that.  
**0:10:50-0:10:55:**  Now, if I ask you to taste it and then you taste it and you go, oh, I totally wouldn't  
**0:10:55-0:10:57:**  have bought that, but I actually really like that.  
**0:10:57-0:11:02:**  Well, back to your point about the healthier fat, I remember hearing you and I think Dr.  
**0:11:02-0:11:08:**  Van Vliet in a conversation talk about that the healthier fat is often yellow.  
**0:11:08-0:11:12:**  And so if you saw it in a store, you would think, oh, that's gone bad.  
**0:11:12-0:11:16:**  But that's actually healthier and for some people more flavorful.  
**0:11:16-0:11:17:**  Yeah.  
**0:11:17-0:11:23:**  I mean, we were doing that tasting last week.  
**0:11:23-0:11:26:**  We were tasting grass fed beef and grain fed beef.  
**0:11:26-0:11:29:**  And it was fascinating.  
**0:11:29-0:11:34:**  The yellow fat wasn't that obvious in the grass fed until we cooked it.  
**0:11:34-0:11:39:**  And then when we cooked it was really bright yellow.  
**0:11:39-0:11:45:**  And you compared that with the same genetics and the animals that had been grown up on  
**0:11:45-0:11:51:**  the same pasture but then had been moved to a feedlot for six weeks to finish.  
**0:11:51-0:11:53:**  The fat was still very white.  
**0:11:53-0:11:57:**  It wasn't perfect to me, it wasn't perfectly white because it takes a long time to get  
**0:11:57-0:12:00:**  the color out of your fat.  
**0:12:00-0:12:05:**  But the flavor was like night and day.  
**0:12:05-0:12:12:**  And the difference in a, like the differences in these animals is almost negligible because  
**0:12:12-0:12:19:**  really one of them just spent more time on the grass to be finished another six weeks.  
**0:12:19-0:12:23:**  And the other ones were in the feedlot for six weeks.  
**0:12:23-0:12:27:**  Yeah, because of the same herd, same genetics, same place.  
**0:12:27-0:12:29:**  All of it.  
**0:12:29-0:12:33:**  And the taste was quite different.  
**0:12:33-0:12:34:**  Tenderness was mildly more tender.  
**0:12:34-0:12:42:**  Like just, I mean, it would have been hard for my untalented palate or my unexperienced  
**0:12:42-0:12:43:**  palate.  
**0:12:43-0:12:46:**  I didn't notice a change in the tenderness.  
**0:12:46-0:12:52:**  But the chefs that were tasting me, they were like, yeah, this is just slightly more tender,  
**0:12:52-0:12:54:**  but it doesn't have any flavor.  
**0:12:54-0:12:56:**  That's another great point to bring in.  
**0:12:56-0:13:02:**  So you're doing some good work with chefs and you have a good network of chefs in your  
**0:13:02-0:13:03:**  world.  
**0:13:03-0:13:07:**  And that's a really exciting thing that we're looking forward to bringing to the podcast  
**0:13:07-0:13:11:**  audience is their expertise paired with yours.  
**0:13:11-0:13:14:**  Like very different ends of the same spectrum.  
**0:13:14-0:13:22:**  Yeah, it's that whole idea of, you know, and I take this all from Chef Dan Barber.  
**0:13:22-0:13:24:**  It was his idea when I first met him.  
**0:13:24-0:13:29:**  It was like, well, can we taste if I taste food that I really like and it's really tasty,  
**0:13:29-0:13:30:**  is it good for me?  
**0:13:30-0:13:32:**  And I'm like, I don't know.  
**0:13:32-0:13:38:**  Intuitively, I think that's probably right, but I don't know.  
**0:13:38-0:13:40:**  And so now we're actually working on that question.  
**0:13:40-0:13:47:**  We're actually asking that question, not only can we chemically understand, like from a  
**0:13:47-0:13:55:**  chemistry perspective, understand that taste and then is that same taste reflected in the  
**0:13:55-0:13:58:**  nutrition of the product.  
**0:13:58-0:14:02:**  And so this is going to be a big project that we're working on in the next, you know, I  
**0:14:02-0:14:06:**  think for the next three or four years is we're going to be really diving into this  
**0:14:06-0:14:13:**  whole idea of what is tasty and is tasty, nutritious.  
**0:14:13-0:14:18:**  And you know, intuitively, we all expect it will be, but we're taking another step and  
**0:14:18-0:14:26:**  that is, is that same flavor, is that same taste linked back to how I grew it?  
**0:14:26-0:14:27:**  Yeah.  
**0:14:27-0:14:29:**  And can I taste regenerative soil?  
**0:14:29-0:14:37:**  I mean, I think about a baker who is using, you know, I think it was Rouge de Bordeaux  
**0:14:37-0:14:38:**  wheat.  
**0:14:38-0:14:43:**  And he said, oh, you know, usually Rouge de Bordeaux doesn't really make that good of  
**0:14:43-0:14:44:**  bread by itself.  
**0:14:44-0:14:45:**  It just doesn't do this.  
**0:14:45-0:14:48:**  It doesn't do this, at least the ones I've done before.  
**0:14:48-0:14:53:**  And then all of a sudden he was using this other grain that had been grown in a really  
**0:14:53-0:14:59:**  good soil by somebody who really tended it really well and not with a whole lot of chemicals.  
**0:14:59-0:15:02:**  And he said, I actually baked a loaf of bread with that and baked fine.  
**0:15:02-0:15:05:**  And he said, it usually doesn't do that.  
**0:15:05-0:15:09:**  And so it's obviously, there's obviously something there.  
**0:15:09-0:15:11:**  We just have to start understanding it.  
**0:15:11-0:15:17:**  And we need more scientists to sort of jump onto the bandwagon and start looking at this  
**0:15:17-0:15:18:**  connection.  
**0:15:18-0:15:26:**  Like, so if this bakes differently, and it's linked to this practice, then how do we, then  
**0:15:26-0:15:29:**  the question becomes is how do we tell people about that?  
**0:15:29-0:15:34:**  How do we help people do what they've done?  
**0:15:34-0:15:38:**  What practice is it that's going to help you get to hear?  
**0:15:38-0:15:43:**  And it may not be for everybody, I admit, but you know, for anybody who's really interested  
**0:15:43-0:15:48:**  in that, you know, that's the whole idea is how can you differentiate your own product?  
**0:15:48-0:15:55:**  How can your product be differentiated based on the practices on your farm and how you  
**0:15:55-0:15:56:**  regenerate your soil?  
**0:15:56-0:16:03:**  And how can you cut through the miles of marketing that are so confusing and frankly misleading  
**0:16:03-0:16:05:**  in a lot of cases.  
**0:16:05-0:16:08:**  And you know, that's been my frustration.  
**0:16:08-0:16:13:**  As you know, I worked a lot with farmers trying to help them explain regenerative agriculture  
**0:16:13-0:16:16:**  and bring that forward working with small brands.  
**0:16:16-0:16:24:**  And it just, they just get lost in a sea of claims that may be legally correct, but that's  
**0:16:24-0:16:27:**  not what the consumer thinks when they, you know, if they even know what regenerative  
**0:16:27-0:16:32:**  agriculture is or this better way of farming is what they're buying is not what they think  
**0:16:32-0:16:33:**  they're getting.  
**0:16:33-0:16:35:**  And because it's hard to build a whole supply chain.  
**0:16:35-0:16:37:**  But anyway, that we'll talk more about all that.  
**0:16:37-0:16:43:**  I mean, yeah, and I'm, I'm sure I actually know you're going to talk a whole lot more  
**0:16:43-0:16:44:**  about that.  
**0:16:44-0:16:51:**  And that's part of it because, I mean, this started with our whole idea of asking people  
**0:16:51-0:16:52:**  what is regenerative?  
**0:16:52-0:16:53:**  Yeah.  
**0:16:53-0:16:58:**  And, and we got all of these answers like, well, and it's wonderful, but this is also  
**0:16:58-0:17:03:**  part of regenerative is regenerating the taste in our food, regenerating the nutrition in  
**0:17:03-0:17:04:**  our food.  
**0:17:04-0:17:06:**  And those two coming back together.  
**0:17:06-0:17:09:**  So you don't have to give up taste for health.  
**0:17:09-0:17:11:**  And you don't have to give up taste for yields either.  
**0:17:11-0:17:12:**  Like that's the whole thing.  
**0:17:12-0:17:13:**  Yeah.  
**0:17:13-0:17:14:**  This whole idea of abundance.  
**0:17:14-0:17:17:**  Well, I just have to have abundance and who cares how it tastes.  
**0:17:17-0:17:19:**  I just need a lot of it.  
**0:17:19-0:17:26:**  Well, no, actually the whole idea of, well, we just need enough to feed ourselves.  
**0:17:26-0:17:28:**  I think that's where we all went wrong.  
**0:17:28-0:17:38:**  I think that the explicit outcome of agriculture for a long time has been abundance more, more,  
**0:17:38-0:17:39:**  more.  
**0:17:39-0:17:40:**  Yeah.  
**0:17:40-0:17:43:**  Without any concentration on nutrition.  
**0:17:43-0:17:48:**  Like, is this more and more and more any good for us?  
**0:17:48-0:17:54:**  And I go back to one of my mentors, Dr. Ross Welsh and a project he, when he started on  
**0:17:54-0:18:02:**  his journey was a project that he and Dr. Jerry Coombs were working on in Bangladesh.  
**0:18:02-0:18:05:**  And they can grow wheat, bushels of wheat.  
**0:18:05-0:18:11:**  I mean, I mean, they're always yielding, you know, over that 120 to 140 mark of wheat,  
**0:18:11-0:18:13:**  bushels of wheat per acre.  
**0:18:13-0:18:17:**  And you know, it's a lot of people here struggle for on a regular basis, but they could do  
**0:18:17-0:18:19:**  it fairly regularly.  
**0:18:19-0:18:25:**  So they started eating wheat and gave up their diets of beans and peas and things like that  
**0:18:25-0:18:30:**  because well, they took more energy to cook and energy was, you know, that was another  
**0:18:30-0:18:33:**  thing they need to regenerate energy too.  
**0:18:33-0:18:35:**  But it just was easier to cook.  
**0:18:35-0:18:38:**  So they started eating more and more of their wheat.  
**0:18:38-0:18:42:**  Well, it turns out their wheat was very deficient in zinc and iron and all these things.  
**0:18:42-0:18:49:**  And they actually noticed that their kids were not as smart as they used to be.  
**0:18:49-0:18:54:**  And that's when they called in Jerry and Ross and they started looking at this and they  
**0:18:54-0:19:00:**  realized that they had two generations of children that were deficient in zinc, which  
**0:19:00-0:19:04:**  really affects their cognitive abilities.  
**0:19:04-0:19:12:**  And so now we think about that and why wasn't agri, why isn't the explicit outcome of agriculture,  
**0:19:12-0:19:15:**  food that's good for you?  
**0:19:15-0:19:19:**  So instead of growing food that's good for us, we just grow an abundance of food and  
**0:19:19-0:19:24:**  then we add, oh, well, we'll add a little zinc and we'll add a little iron and we'll  
**0:19:24-0:19:27:**  add this and we'll add that and then we'll make it good for you.  
**0:19:27-0:19:28:**  We're not going to grow it good for you.  
**0:19:28-0:19:30:**  We're just going to make it good for you.  
**0:19:30-0:19:36:**  No, we should be growing it good for us because then we really get regenerative because once  
**0:19:36-0:19:44:**  we start growing it good for us and we start growing the nutrition, we start talking about  
**0:19:44-0:19:48:**  climate change, we start making the whole water cycle different.  
**0:19:48-0:19:50:**  We start having clean water.  
**0:19:50-0:19:53:**  We start having every drop of water going to the ground.  
**0:19:53-0:19:55:**  We start having water holding capacity.  
**0:19:55-0:20:00:**  We start having all these really good things and the whole system becomes much better.  
**0:20:00-0:20:01:**  The virtuous cycle.  
**0:20:01-0:20:02:**  And then do we taste that too?  
**0:20:02-0:20:04:**  I don't know, but I think we do.  
**0:20:04-0:20:08:**  Yeah, before we go too much further, I want to make sure and give the audience a chance  
**0:20:08-0:20:12:**  to learn more about your background and how you're able to know a lot of these things  
**0:20:12-0:20:14:**  about the nutrition in food.  
**0:20:14-0:20:19:**  So just share with them a little bit about you, about your background.  
**0:20:19-0:20:21:**  Oh, my background.  
**0:20:21-0:20:29:**  Well, I mean, since I can remember, I've had an interest in plants right from the time  
**0:20:29-0:20:35:**  that my grandfather was growing, had this gorgeous garden in his backyard and he also  
**0:20:35-0:20:36:**  bred roses.  
**0:20:36-0:20:43:**  So I remember in the morning waking up and the smell of the roses from the garden, and  
**0:20:43-0:20:47:**  that's something that you don't have as much anymore, but it actually would waft all the  
**0:20:47-0:20:51:**  way to the second floor of my bedroom when I stayed at his house.  
**0:20:51-0:20:57:**  And I can remember waking up to the smell of roses just marvelous.  
**0:20:57-0:21:02:**  To this day, I love roses and I think it's because it takes me back to those days as  
**0:21:02-0:21:07:**  a kid waking up to this fragrance of roses.  
**0:21:07-0:21:15:**  And then he used to leave cucumbers hiding in amongst all the vegetation for me to find.  
**0:21:15-0:21:19:**  And so he tasked me with going out to find a cucumber.  
**0:21:19-0:21:23:**  And I mean, I was less than five years old when we were doing this.  
**0:21:23-0:21:28:**  And so I would be rummaging around, you know, Grandpa, grandpa, I found one, you know, and  
**0:21:28-0:21:31:**  he of course, he knew exactly where it was.  
**0:21:31-0:21:37:**  But just from that time on, and then we'd go in and we'd make cucumber sandwiches with  
**0:21:37-0:21:40:**  the cucumber I found.  
**0:21:40-0:21:46:**  And they always tasted delicious.  
**0:21:46-0:21:52:**  And so I went on to, you know, work in botany.  
**0:21:52-0:21:59:**  I have a PhD in plant physiology, biochemistry, and went on to try and understand the effects  
**0:21:59-0:22:08:**  of the environment on plant physiology and how, mostly how mycorrhizal fungi, how fungi  
**0:22:08-0:22:13:**  in the soil bring in all these nutrients and how that affects plants.  
**0:22:13-0:22:17:**  And then how that changes the whole environment of the roots.  
**0:22:17-0:22:22:**  And I really concentrated on roots rather than above ground, because I've always believed  
**0:22:22-0:22:27:**  that roots are where it all happens.  
**0:22:27-0:22:31:**  I mean, roots are the whole nutrition aspect.  
**0:22:31-0:22:33:**  They keep the plant healthy.  
**0:22:33-0:22:37:**  It's how we, and it changes the soils.  
**0:22:37-0:22:39:**  And I was really lucky along the way.  
**0:22:39-0:22:45:**  I mean, I was mentored by two brilliant Australian scientists, Dr. Albert Rivera and Dr. Glyn  
**0:22:45-0:22:48:**  Bowen really early on.  
**0:22:48-0:22:53:**  Like just, I mean, I hadn't even graduated when they sort of mentored me a little bit.  
**0:22:53-0:23:01:**  And then, and Dr. Dennis Parkinson, who was a mycologist who really spawned my interest  
**0:23:01-0:23:06:**  in fungi and this whole idea of what fungi could do.  
**0:23:06-0:23:11:**  But I mean, Dr. Albert Rivera really coined the term rhizosphere and how the rhizosphere  
**0:23:11-0:23:13:**  works together.  
**0:23:13-0:23:15:**  And that sort of came together.  
**0:23:15-0:23:22:**  And I hit it at a time when I just started university where I got to meet all these amazing  
**0:23:22-0:23:30:**  scientists like Dr. Jack Harley from Oxford who wrote the first book on mycorrhizae.  
**0:23:30-0:23:35:**  And I got to listen to lectures from him and then later with his daughter, Sally Smith.  
**0:23:35-0:23:45:**  And I'm sure I'm going to forget people here, but I just was so lucky to have had  
**0:23:45-0:23:54:**  the input in my developing scientific years from people also like Lynette Abbott out of  
**0:23:54-0:23:58:**  Western Australia, who has this passion, who really coined the term soil health.  
**0:23:58-0:24:00:**  Most people don't know that, but she did.  
**0:24:00-0:24:07:**  And I can't thank these people enough for sort of like keeping me going along the way.  
**0:24:07-0:24:14:**  And then it was really Ross Welsh who took me aside and really started helping me understand  
**0:24:14-0:24:17:**  the links between practice and nutrition.  
**0:24:17-0:24:22:**  And he said that was the one thing he really regretted in his career was that he never  
**0:24:22-0:24:26:**  got a chance to really look at practice and how it linked to nutrition.  
**0:24:26-0:24:28:**  So, you took up that.  
**0:24:28-0:24:29:**  I did.  
**0:24:29-0:24:30:**  I grabbed the torch.  
**0:24:30-0:24:31:**  That's good.  
**0:24:31-0:24:32:**  That's good.  
**0:24:32-0:24:34:**  That's what every scientist wants, right?  
**0:24:34-0:24:36:**  A clearly defined path to continue on.  
**0:24:36-0:24:37:**  Yeah.  
**0:24:37-0:24:38:**  Yeah.  
**0:24:38-0:24:39:**  So, I grabbed the torch.  
**0:24:39-0:24:45:**  And even though I haven't really worked on it fully until the last couple of years, I've  
**0:24:45-0:24:51:**  always been sort of dabbling in that area and sort of asking farmers, well, does it  
**0:24:51-0:24:54:**  taste, you know, and asking people, does it taste different?  
**0:24:54-0:24:59:**  But then I realized that we really, the people who have embraced regenerative agriculture  
**0:24:59-0:25:06:**  and who really grown their soils and who have made these changes, and there's lots of them.  
**0:25:06-0:25:08:**  I'm glad you said that.  
**0:25:08-0:25:12:**  Because that's the thing I hear all the time in talking with emerging brands and companies  
**0:25:12-0:25:15:**  that want to bring regenerative to the public.  
**0:25:15-0:25:19:**  And they even portray to the public, well, if just the farmers would come along and I'm  
**0:25:19-0:25:22:**  over here screaming in the corner, there are tons of farmers.  
**0:25:22-0:25:27:**  There are more farmers doing this than you can manage in your supply chain.  
**0:25:27-0:25:28:**  And that's the problem.  
**0:25:28-0:25:31:**  They don't want to manage a separate supply chain.  
**0:25:31-0:25:33:**  They don't want to deal with the complexity of it.  
**0:25:33-0:25:38:**  But don't say it's not that there aren't any farmers doing it because there are around  
**0:25:38-0:25:39:**  the world.  
**0:25:39-0:25:40:**  Oh, I know.  
**0:25:40-0:25:45:**  I heard that when I was in Brussels at a conference on food security and nutrition.  
**0:25:45-0:25:48:**  And there was, well, you know, we need to bring the farmers along.  
**0:25:48-0:25:54:**  And I stood up and I was like, no, actually, you need to actually listen to the farmers.  
**0:25:54-0:25:55:**  You need to come along.  
**0:25:55-0:25:57:**  You need to bring the processes along.  
**0:25:57-0:25:58:**  That's what you need to do.  
**0:25:58-0:25:59:**  Yeah.  
**0:25:59-0:26:01:**  And I was like, it's not farmers.  
**0:26:01-0:26:03:**  Farmers have embraced regenerative agriculture.  
**0:26:03-0:26:05:**  They are rebuilding their souls.  
**0:26:05-0:26:07:**  They are doing all these things.  
**0:26:07-0:26:13:**  You just are so isolated in your silo that you don't realize this whole movement is going  
**0:26:13-0:26:15:**  on around you.  
**0:26:15-0:26:17:**  And you have to pay for it.  
**0:26:17-0:26:19:**  They don't want to pay for it.  
**0:26:19-0:26:22:**  Well, but also as scientists, we haven't connected there.  
**0:26:22-0:26:23:**  Right.  
**0:26:23-0:26:24:**  Because we're not supposed to connect there.  
**0:26:24-0:26:32:**  I mean, I remember applying for grants early on and we were doing nutrition.  
**0:26:32-0:26:34:**  But we were linking it to soils.  
**0:26:34-0:26:38:**  And they said, well, you know, but this is not really in nutritional science.  
**0:26:38-0:26:39:**  We don't.  
**0:26:39-0:26:41:**  And so you should apply in soil.  
**0:26:41-0:26:42:**  So we'd apply in soils.  
**0:26:42-0:26:45:**  And you go, yeah, but that we don't do that in soils.  
**0:26:45-0:26:48:**  And I'm like, look, this is the integration of these two.  
**0:26:48-0:26:55:**  Because the outcome of working on soil health, the outcome of soil health is more nutritious  
**0:26:55-0:26:56:**  food.  
**0:26:56-0:26:58:**  So how are they not linked together?  
**0:26:58-0:27:03:**  But the problem was is that we're so used to pigeonholing all these disciplines that  
**0:27:03-0:27:09:**  we don't see the requirement for interdisciplinary science.  
**0:27:09-0:27:10:**  And that's where we need.  
**0:27:10-0:27:12:**  We need everybody working together.  
**0:27:12-0:27:14:**  We need us all to come together.  
**0:27:14-0:27:20:**  That's back to so much of what you have helped me see is how amazing the whole world underground  
**0:27:20-0:27:25:**  is the microbiome and how it all works together in harmony.  
**0:27:25-0:27:30:**  Like one thing gives this this chemical and the other thing takes it up.  
**0:27:30-0:27:35:**  And it's all this massive it looks like chaos maybe to those the uninitiated.  
**0:27:35-0:27:39:**  But it's but when you really understand it, it's a massive amount of harmony that could  
**0:27:39-0:27:44:**  only exist because there's no one person directing it all.  
**0:27:44-0:27:46:**  They're all synchronized together.  
**0:27:46-0:27:53:**  And maybe that's a system that is hard for us people to do or to think about because  
**0:27:53-0:27:57:**  we're used to just like clear it all away and put what's supposed to be there and manage  
**0:27:57-0:27:58:**  it.  
**0:27:58-0:28:02:**  You know, that's very different than I know in nature.  
**0:28:02-0:28:07:**  I was listening to the creative director for the Silk Road ensemble this morning on the  
**0:28:07-0:28:09:**  radio.  
**0:28:09-0:28:14:**  And she talked about and she said, you know, they were talking about, well, a Japanese  
**0:28:14-0:28:20:**  flute working with, you know, a sitar and some of these other instruments like you don't  
**0:28:20-0:28:24:**  think that song would they would even belong in that song.  
**0:28:24-0:28:31:**  And yet after you hear it, you go, of course they do.  
**0:28:31-0:28:35:**  And that's my point here is that we need that creative.  
**0:28:35-0:28:41:**  It's not about everybody doing the same thing, repeating the same thing.  
**0:28:41-0:28:46:**  We have to be able to have that creative spirit where what you do on your farm to regenerate  
**0:28:46-0:28:53:**  soil is uniquely yours and good on you because you're working with your environment to do  
**0:28:53-0:28:55:**  this.  
**0:28:55-0:28:58:**  And somebody else on their farm is working with their environment to do this.  
**0:28:58-0:29:01:**  And in the end, we're getting all this great food.  
**0:29:01-0:29:03:**  We're all growing all these different varieties.  
**0:29:03-0:29:05:**  The varieties are fine.  
**0:29:05-0:29:07:**  We can't just grow one variety.  
**0:29:07-0:29:13:**  We need to grow many varieties and then we can blend all these different varieties and  
**0:29:13-0:29:17:**  these different or even the same variety growing in all these different places together to  
**0:29:17-0:29:20:**  get it instead of fortifying with ingredients.  
**0:29:20-0:29:24:**  Why don't we just blend grains from different areas of the world together to get the nutrition  
**0:29:24-0:29:25:**  we want?  
**0:29:25-0:29:30:**  Just like farmers in North Dakota and South Dakota were selling grain over to Europe because  
**0:29:30-0:29:35:**  it was high selenium because they have high selenium soils and it was being reflected  
**0:29:35-0:29:37:**  in the quality of their grain.  
**0:29:37-0:29:39:**  We can use all of that.  
**0:29:39-0:29:40:**  And that's part of the terroir.  
**0:29:40-0:29:46:**  That's part of the connection to the terroir is that my soils are going to have unique  
**0:29:46-0:29:49:**  characteristics that your soils do not.  
**0:29:49-0:29:53:**  But if we blend them together and we regenerate all our soils together, it's going to be so  
**0:29:53-0:29:58:**  much better for all of us.  
**0:29:58-0:29:59:**  And we have to work together.  
**0:29:59-0:30:03:**  We can't just work in one little cluster here and one little cluster there.  
**0:30:03-0:30:07:**  It's got to start to move out from the clusters.  
**0:30:07-0:30:11:**  And it can't be, well, do I have to do exactly what so and so did?  
**0:30:11-0:30:13:**  The answer is no, you don't.  
**0:30:13-0:30:17:**  You have to do what you can do to regenerate your farm.  
**0:30:17-0:30:21:**  You have to do what you can do to make tasty food on your farm.  
**0:30:21-0:30:25:**  And maybe you're going to have slightly different genetics than somebody else.  
**0:30:25-0:30:26:**  That's okay.  
**0:30:26-0:30:31:**  Because the other thing that we found growing 84 different genetic varieties of wheat on  
**0:30:31-0:30:36:**  the same farm over the same season is that they all took up different amounts of nutrients.  
**0:30:36-0:30:37:**  Wow.  
**0:30:37-0:30:38:**  That's amazing.  
**0:30:38-0:30:39:**  I know.  
**0:30:39-0:30:44:**  And it's like, so there's no standardization here.  
**0:30:44-0:30:51:**  This is embracing the very wonderful French term, which is vive la différence.  
**0:30:51-0:30:58:**  And we all need to embrace the difference and not about just, we all need to be the  
**0:30:58-0:30:59:**  same.  
**0:30:59-0:31:00:**  We all need to be different.  
**0:31:00-0:31:01:**  We need to grow different varieties.  
**0:31:01-0:31:06:**  We need to grow varieties that are adapted to our own climates.  
**0:31:06-0:31:12:**  And what's adapted over there might not grow here, but maybe I can grow the same amount  
**0:31:12-0:31:17:**  and of different quality in my own backyard.  
**0:31:17-0:31:23:**  And maybe I need the varieties that grow best in my really dry, hot climate instead of trying  
**0:31:23-0:31:30:**  to grow something that was developed in Florida with a lot of water.  
**0:31:30-0:31:32:**  Several of that came to me last week.  
**0:31:32-0:31:41:**  There was a blueberry grower from Florida who was talking to a group of chefs and he  
**0:31:41-0:31:46:**  was at Blue Hill restaurant talking to a group of chefs.  
**0:31:46-0:31:53:**  And chef Dan Barber was talking about how these blueberries were so amazing.  
**0:31:53-0:31:54:**  And we're going to get him to talk.  
**0:31:54-0:31:56:**  He's going to talk on tasting terroir.  
**0:31:56-0:32:02:**  So I'm not going to give his name away, so you're all going to have to listen.  
**0:32:02-0:32:07:**  And he was talking about his soil and how he was growing the same variety as everybody  
**0:32:07-0:32:08:**  else around him.  
**0:32:08-0:32:12:**  He wasn't growing special varieties or anything like that, but he believed that what he was  
**0:32:12-0:32:17:**  doing, like his mulching and all these other things were affecting.  
**0:32:17-0:32:21:**  And he said, I don't understand how that works, but I think it works.  
**0:32:21-0:32:26:**  And then it's just, to me, I said to him, I said, well, your mulching works because  
**0:32:26-0:32:31:**  when you mulch, so this is another connection and things that just little things here and  
**0:32:31-0:32:38:**  there, but when you mulch, you insulate the roots from temperature, which is why we want  
**0:32:38-0:32:42:**  cover crops and why we want more residue, but you actually insulate the roots from the  
**0:32:42-0:32:43:**  effects of temperature.  
**0:32:43-0:32:46:**  Well, blueberries don't like really hot temperatures.  
**0:32:46-0:32:50:**  So now you throw that mulch on top of them.  
**0:32:50-0:32:53:**  So you're mowing between the rows and you throw all the weed mulch and everything else  
**0:32:53-0:32:54:**  on top of them.  
**0:32:54-0:32:59:**  You insulate the roots so the roots stay cool when the roots stay cool.  
**0:32:59-0:33:01:**  Even if it's hot outside, they keep pumping.  
**0:33:01-0:33:05:**  So the transpiration steering keeps going because the roots are cool enough.  
**0:33:05-0:33:06:**  They don't care.  
**0:33:06-0:33:08:**  We can keep cooling you off.  
**0:33:08-0:33:10:**  It's like on a hot day, you have to keep drinking, right?  
**0:33:10-0:33:13:**  So that you can keep sweating.  
**0:33:13-0:33:19:**  And so the same thing on a hot day, if we keep the roots cool, the plant can keep sweating,  
**0:33:19-0:33:20:**  can keep transpiring.  
**0:33:20-0:33:27:**  Well, in that transpiration stream comes all the calcium and the boron that don't normally  
**0:33:27-0:33:32:**  move at all unless they're pulled up by the transpiration stream.  
**0:33:32-0:33:37:**  So now I get fruit set.  
**0:33:37-0:33:41:**  I keep the skins in my berries really good because I got a lot of calcium going into  
**0:33:41-0:33:42:**  them.  
**0:33:42-0:33:45:**  They get the boron so they stay on the plant much more easily.  
**0:33:45-0:33:46:**  They just don't drop off.  
**0:33:46-0:33:48:**  All these things.  
**0:33:48-0:33:50:**  And I'm sure that you would be able to taste.  
**0:33:50-0:33:56:**  Maybe you won't taste the calcium per se, but you'll taste the effect of that mulch.  
**0:33:56-0:33:57:**  And you'll get the calcium.  
**0:33:57-0:33:58:**  And you'll get the calcium.  
**0:33:58-0:33:59:**  Yes, you'll get it.  
**0:33:59-0:34:04:**  And maybe that's why it tastes so good because people go, oh, this blueberry tastes amazing  
**0:34:04-0:34:11:**  because you also have all the ingredients to make those anthocyanins and those antioxidants  
**0:34:11-0:34:13:**  that are rich in the skin of the blueberries.  
**0:34:13-0:34:19:**  We get all this mineral nutrition because the blueberries are well mulched so they can  
**0:34:19-0:34:20:**  keep transpiring.  
**0:34:20-0:34:21:**  They can keep sucking up the zinc.  
**0:34:21-0:34:22:**  They can suck up the iron.  
**0:34:22-0:34:26:**  They can suck up all these other things that can make all the amino acids that give it  
**0:34:26-0:34:30:**  that slight tart laser in the organic acids.  
**0:34:30-0:34:35:**  Maybe we don't taste the terroir in the same way we think, but we taste it through the  
**0:34:35-0:34:41:**  nutrition of the plant that allows them to make these molecules that we taste and make  
**0:34:41-0:34:42:**  the flavor.  
**0:34:42-0:34:44:**  And that we crave because we need them.  
**0:34:44-0:34:45:**  Yeah, we crave when we have it.  
**0:34:45-0:34:46:**  Right.  
**0:34:46-0:34:47:**  Yeah.  
**0:34:47-0:34:48:**  Right.  
**0:34:48-0:34:52:**  It strikes me as you're talking about all of this that really it's like seeing what  
**0:34:52-0:34:57:**  we want to see is a system of growing that's more like a garden and less like a factory.  
**0:34:57-0:34:59:**  So you're still tending it.  
**0:34:59-0:35:00:**  You're still involved with it.  
**0:35:00-0:35:01:**  You're interacting it.  
**0:35:01-0:35:03:**  You're noticing what the plants need and you're helping.  
**0:35:03-0:35:04:**  It's not you're absent.  
**0:35:04-0:35:10:**  You're not just like throw a field to chaos and, oh, throw a few seeds out there and hope  
**0:35:10-0:35:11:**  it works.  
**0:35:11-0:35:14:**  That was how I described Iowa farmers actually coming from Kansas.  
**0:35:14-0:35:19:**  But anyway, so you are involved in the system.  
**0:35:19-0:35:20:**  You are a part of it.  
**0:35:20-0:35:22:**  You are tending it.  
**0:35:22-0:35:24:**  But a factory is much more in control.  
**0:35:24-0:35:29:**  And back to the specialization they talked about, like each person just hits their widget  
**0:35:29-0:35:31:**  or pushes their button.  
**0:35:31-0:35:37:**  Each person plays a very separated piece of the supply chain puzzle.  
**0:35:37-0:35:44:**  But the loss of the organic interaction, it stops being an organic system.  
**0:35:44-0:35:45:**  Yeah.  
**0:35:45-0:35:55:**  I have a friend, a scientist, Rennie Anker, who's at Guelph, University of Guelph in Ontario.  
**0:35:55-0:35:57:**  And he talks about Betty Crocker farming.  
**0:35:57-0:36:02:**  So some of the millennials are not going to understand Betty Crocker.  
**0:36:02-0:36:09:**  Betty Crocker was, or Duncan Hines, but it was like a cake in a box.  
**0:36:09-0:36:11:**  I'm sure there are other examples of this.  
**0:36:11-0:36:15:**  But it was everything.  
**0:36:15-0:36:19:**  All you had to do was add water and stir and then throw it in the oven and you bake the  
**0:36:19-0:36:20:**  cake.  
**0:36:20-0:36:21:**  Right.  
**0:36:21-0:36:23:**  And they still have cake in a box.  
**0:36:23-0:36:27:**  I don't know what it's called, but we used to laugh because it used to be like seeds  
**0:36:27-0:36:34:**  in a box with the seed companies and Roundup Ready seeds and all these other seeds.  
**0:36:34-0:36:41:**  You just buy the seed, buy the chemicals, put them in and voila, there's your crop all  
**0:36:41-0:36:42:**  taken care of.  
**0:36:42-0:36:45:**  And you just go out there and you harvest it.  
**0:36:45-0:36:51:**  And I think what you were talking about is you have to manage it in your head.  
**0:36:51-0:36:54:**  You actually have to think about what am I growing next?  
**0:36:54-0:36:57:**  So I've grown peas.  
**0:36:57-0:36:59:**  So what's going to come after peas?  
**0:36:59-0:37:05:**  Or in my case, and I'll use an example from my own farm, I grew a lot of winter rye in  
**0:37:05-0:37:11:**  my cover crops because I was trying to change the soils a whole lot and grow a lot of roots  
**0:37:11-0:37:12:**  and things like that.  
**0:37:12-0:37:15:**  And it just turned out that the rye grew better than pretty much anything else.  
**0:37:15-0:37:20:**  So then the next year, when I, so then that fall, when I went, you know, that's later  
**0:37:20-0:37:25:**  on that summer when I went to grow milo, I struggled.  
**0:37:25-0:37:27:**  My milo is taking its time.  
**0:37:27-0:37:28:**  It is lethargic.  
**0:37:28-0:37:32:**  It's like, Oh, something about this is not quite right.  
**0:37:32-0:37:34:**  And I realized it was like, my rye is inhibiting.  
**0:37:34-0:37:39:**  I have, she have an allelopathic reaction on my milo.  
**0:37:39-0:37:43:**  Well that's, I have to rethink that.  
**0:37:43-0:37:45:**  I didn't fail.  
**0:37:45-0:37:49:**  And too many people go, Oh, well, cover crops don't work.  
**0:37:49-0:37:54:**  No, that is because I chose wrong.  
**0:37:54-0:37:58:**  I mean, I'm good at choosing, but I chose wrong.  
**0:37:58-0:38:01:**  Each plant does a specific thing and has a specific interaction.  
**0:38:01-0:38:08:**  Yeah, the rye can be very allelopathic and especially allelopathic to warm season plants.  
**0:38:08-0:38:12:**  And I didn't get my mix right.  
**0:38:12-0:38:20:**  And because I'm in South Central Kansas on the border with Oklahoma, it's dry and the  
**0:38:20-0:38:23:**  residues are there and the roots are there.  
**0:38:23-0:38:25:**  And we're going in no till.  
**0:38:25-0:38:27:**  And so here's my effect of terroir.  
**0:38:27-0:38:33:**  My cover crop was inhibiting the growth of my other crop.  
**0:38:33-0:38:37:**  And I was inhibiting weeds and a bunch of other things, but you know, this is about  
**0:38:37-0:38:41:**  choosing wisely.  
**0:38:41-0:38:48:**  And I, and getting your plants so that they all grow together because plant communities  
**0:38:48-0:38:49:**  don't just grow together.  
**0:38:49-0:38:54:**  I mean, some plants don't like to grow with others and some plants, like some of the weeds  
**0:38:54-0:39:01:**  that we have, like, so for the farmers that are in rangeland, like leafy spurge actually  
**0:39:01-0:39:05:**  sends out root signals that inhibit things from growing around them so they can exploit  
**0:39:05-0:39:09:**  all the resources around their roots.  
**0:39:09-0:39:10:**  Plants aren't above doing that.  
**0:39:10-0:39:14:**  Like, you know, getting the elbows out and going, Hey, stay over, you know, keep your  
**0:39:14-0:39:17:**  own space.  
**0:39:17-0:39:21:**  And those are the plants you don't want in your community because you want plants that  
**0:39:21-0:39:27:**  allow roots to move together and allow the roots to weave together so they all share.  
**0:39:27-0:39:32:**  And I think that's another part of terroir is that when we get plant communities, right,  
**0:39:32-0:39:37:**  like when I get my companions, right, so they support my cash crop, I think that the whole  
**0:39:37-0:39:42:**  community is working together because we know that they survive drought a whole lot better.  
**0:39:42-0:39:43:**  So they're sharing resources.  
**0:39:43-0:39:48:**  How will that not be reflected in the grains or in the food that I grow from those like  
**0:39:48-0:39:51:**  the beans and the peas and the sesame and all that?  
**0:39:51-0:39:53:**  Well, it will, I think.  
**0:39:53-0:39:55:**  And I think it's reflected in my beef as well.  
**0:39:55-0:39:59:**  And even the bottom line, I mean, it's great to have the effects of the nutrition for the  
**0:39:59-0:40:05:**  consumer and, and but even the bottom line for the farmer, because they lose crops to  
**0:40:05-0:40:08:**  drought all the time, especially drought continues.  
**0:40:08-0:40:10:**  And it seems counterintuitive.  
**0:40:10-0:40:14:**  Like if you plant a cover crop, I know a lot of farmers that haven't worked with it as  
**0:40:14-0:40:18:**  much are fearful that, well, that cover crops going to take up moisture, I need that moisture  
**0:40:18-0:40:20:**  for my cash crop next year.  
**0:40:20-0:40:22:**  But it's, it's, it's the opposite.  
**0:40:22-0:40:23:**  It's that abundance principle.  
**0:40:23-0:40:25:**  And it's so weird.  
**0:40:25-0:40:29:**  I mean, I know that green cover did all these experiments where they put moisture probes  
**0:40:29-0:40:34:**  in the ground, and show very clearly that 12 species cover crop is less moisture than  
**0:40:34-0:40:35:**  a soybean crop.  
**0:40:35-0:40:39:**  And you can't you're like, whoa, and holds it in.  
**0:40:39-0:40:40:**  Right?  
**0:40:40-0:40:41:**  Hold the moisture in.  
**0:40:41-0:40:48:**  Put your hand underneath that cover, you can feel the moisture and you can feel the coolness.  
**0:40:48-0:40:54:**  And it's like I said, you insulate the soil, there's no evaporation off the soil itself.  
**0:40:54-0:40:57:**  Soil never really heats up.  
**0:40:57-0:41:00:**  So it keeps working.  
**0:41:00-0:41:01:**  And that means roots can go deeper.  
**0:41:01-0:41:03:**  That means roots get more nutrition.  
**0:41:03-0:41:04:**  Yes.  
**0:41:04-0:41:05:**  Do they transpire?  
**0:41:05-0:41:06:**  Yes.  
**0:41:06-0:41:07:**  But that's the whole point.  
**0:41:07-0:41:11:**  If we transpire, then we build up moisture in the atmosphere, which eventually comes  
**0:41:11-0:41:12:**  down as rain again.  
**0:41:12-0:41:17:**  So we start working on this whole water cycle in a really good way.  
**0:41:17-0:41:23:**  So I think the whole point here of tasting terroir is that it's all connected.  
**0:41:23-0:41:27:**  What we taste and the flavor in our food is connected to what we do on the land.  
**0:41:27-0:41:35:**  And it's connected then to climate and, and all these other big regional variations that  
**0:41:35-0:41:40:**  sometimes we only have this intuitive understanding of, but we don't really...  
**0:41:40-0:41:42:**  And do we need to understand everything explicitly?  
**0:41:42-0:41:44:**  I'm not sure we do.  
**0:41:44-0:41:48:**  I think it's okay to know.  
**0:41:48-0:41:55:**  And I think that I don't know that there could be anything bad about enjoying natural flavor.  
**0:41:55-0:42:00:**  Like if something's really good and you are loving it and you know it's grown in this,  
**0:42:00-0:42:04:**  I mean, I think you could probably trace it back and go, I love the flavor of this, like  
**0:42:04-0:42:08:**  these blueberries and everybody's like, Oh my gosh, they were so amazing.  
**0:42:08-0:42:15:**  And they were grown in this really interesting and unique way without fertilize, like without  
**0:42:15-0:42:17:**  any real additives in the same variety.  
**0:42:17-0:42:20:**  Neighbors doesn't taste nearly as good as this.  
**0:42:20-0:42:21:**  Why?  
**0:42:21-0:42:24:**  Because of the way it's grown.

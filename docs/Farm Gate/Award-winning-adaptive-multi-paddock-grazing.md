**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to FarmGate. I'm Finlow Costain, the Chief Executive of FarmWell. McDonald's  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:10):**  UK and Ireland and FAI Farms have won Compassion in World Farming's prestigious Sustainable  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:15):**  Food and Farming Award for their work on regenerative beef. This is a four-year project centered  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:20):**  on adaptive multi-paddled grazing, but even two years into the transition, the results  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:24):**  have been outstanding. So what are they? How have they been achieved? And what has FAI  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:30):**  learned along the way? Well, that's in a moment, but just before we get properly started,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:33):**  I want to let you know that later in the program, we'll also be talking about new regenerative  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:38):**  agriculture training that's available online at FAI.academy, and we'll even give you a  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:43):**  FarmGate discount code to help you get started. But now, to discuss their award-winning work  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:48):**  on AMP grazing, I'm joined by Claire Hill, FAI's Director of Regenerative Agriculture  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:53):**  and FAI's Assistant Farm Manager, Silas Headley-Lawrence. Hello both.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:00:58):**  Hi. Hi Finlow.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:00):**  Claire, you must be over the moon to have won this award, not least because it's you  
**[0:01:04-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:04):**  who's been driving this work from the start. Yeah, over the moon is exactly the way to  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:08):**  describe it. We're really pleased. Never did we expect to win so soon. In fact, to start  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:14):**  with we said, oh no, we're not going to apply because we haven't got enough information.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:18):**  But in the end, we decided to go for it. And yeah, over the moon is exactly the way to  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:22):**  describe it, how we feel. And Silas, you're a newer member of the FAI  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:26):**  farm team. Has this project delivered the outcomes that you expected?  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:29):**  Yeah, I would say so. I'm certainly not surprised. I'm new at FAI, but I have been farming regeneratively  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:35):**  for a few years at least. The outcomes we've seen here at FAI are very similar to what  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:39):**  I've seen in the past and also what I've witnessed from friends and other people in  
**[0:01:43-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:43):**  networks that are also farming in a similar system.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:45):**  Fantastic. We're going to go into the details of what those outcomes are and what you've  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:49):**  discovered. But before we do that, Claire, Compassion's Sustainable Food and Farming  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:53):**  Award is specifically for FAI's and McDonald's work on adaptive multi-paddled grazing. But  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:01:59):**  this is just one of many tools that's used by regenerative farmers. How does it fit into  
**[0:02:04-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:04):**  the regenerative mix? Tools is a good way to describe it. With regenerative  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:08):**  farming, we talk about a toolbox of different things and it depends on your context, what  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:14):**  you're trying to farm, what you want to farm. Maybe you're going to change that. And for  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:18):**  us, it was about having a lot of grassland on the farm and wanting to improve the way  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:24):**  that we farm that. And so using adaptive multi-paddled grazing, so effectively making a grazing plan,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:30):**  but building in gaps to make it adaptive. So when building in flood and drought, building  
**[0:02:37-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:37):**  in capacity, sorry, for like flood and drought and adapting and changing, not getting set  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:41):**  to a certain plan is important. When you say building in capacity, you're  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:46):**  not talking about concrete. No, not concrete. No, it would be, I think  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:51):**  just for us, even having a conversation of, okay, well, if it does burn off in early,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:02:58):**  what would we do? Would we buffer feed with hay? Would we be able to make use of a different  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:02):**  piece of land? What if we rested this now? Would that provide us some gaps? And we don't  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:07):**  necessarily make a decision about how we'll deal with those problems as they come up.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:11):**  But we've had a bit more of a conversation and a thought about how we feel and how we  
**[0:03:15-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:15):**  think we would best deal with them if they do come up.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:17):**  And when you talk about managing flood and managing drought, a lot of that is down to  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:23):**  soil, isn't it? It's the soil carbon sponge that you're trying to revitalise.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:26):**  Yeah, exactly that. Sponge is the key word. So for us, it's about holding onto our floodwaters  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:31):**  or all the rain we get in the winter and holding onto it for longer through the summer months  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:36):**  to prevent the kind of burn off that we've always traditionally had on this farm. But  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:40):**  if we could get green grass growing all the way through our summer, then that's productivity  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:44):**  right there because normally we accept a kind of level of levelling off of our growth rate.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:49):**  So we just accept that our animals don't grow very much in the summer months and that's  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:51):**  because the grass burns off. So we're all about trying to improve the water holding  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:03:55):**  capacity of our soil. And we do that through adaptive multipadic grazing. So a large number  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:00):**  of animals for a short period of time followed by a long rest period allows the plant to  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:05):**  recover and grow and have deep roots and to improve the soil structure through different  
**[0:04:11-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:11):**  plants being allowed to express themselves.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:13):**  And presumably if that grass is continuing to grow for longer and then because you've  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:17):**  moved the animals around, you're able to utilise grass in paddocks into the winter as well,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:24):**  that means that you're getting better growth rates for longer throughout the year.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:27):**  Yeah, the thing that I think we've been so surprised with so quickly is how well our  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:32):**  animals are performing. So we'll finish our first cattle this year in 16 months. In days  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:40):**  gone by, we used to not be finishing, we'd start sending cattle at 20, 24 months and  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:44):**  we've reduced the level of inputs now because we're completely, completely pasture based  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:47):**  and outside, majority of animals are outside all year round. So our costs have come right  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:52):**  down. It's not all of our animals finishing in 16 months, I should say, but certainly  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:04:57):**  to start in 16 months and to have them all finishing through this summer means that we're  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:01):**  going to be housing, if we do have to house anything, we'll be taking many fewer animals  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:05):**  through next winter, which is going to be much better for the farm and for our cost  
**[0:05:08-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:08):**  base.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:09):**  So, you're managing the farm on a day to day basis. When Claire talks about a lot of animals,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:14):**  you know, in smaller paddocks then being moved on, it's hard to visualise that. Are we talking  
**[0:05:19-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:19):**  about really densely packed animals in a tiny space?  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:23):**  I think it depends about what you're trying to achieve. It also depends on how much biomass  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:27):**  is in each cell that you've made. You know, for instance, when we're carving, I very much  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:30):**  like to give the cows and calves more space, move them less often, just so it's a little  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:35):**  bit less hectic, stressful, there's more space for cows to go off and carve and it's a bit  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:39):**  of privacy. Whereas with the yearlings, maybe we'll get them a little bit denser, we'll  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:44):**  move them more often, you know, daily, could even do multiple times a day move. I would  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:48):**  never leave anything in the same cell for more than four days. That's usually because  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:52):**  after four days in growing season, the plants grazed off in the first day are often starting  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:05:57):**  to regrow and then the cattle will probably go back and graze those new shoots off. And  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:01):**  that's when you start overgrazing plants. So the idea is if you have, you know, what  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:05):**  might even be a very large field, but would probably have a week to 10 days worth of grazing  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:10):**  in it by conventional standards, if you could split that into two or three or four fields,  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:15):**  and you know that you're not going to start overgrazing plants.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:17):**  Jason Vale- Just to give us a sense of the size of these paddocks and the size of the  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:21):**  fields, most of us, I'm sure, you know, sort of talking and listening will know what an  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:25):**  acre looks like. So how much of an acre is your average paddock and how many cattle are  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:30):**  you having in that average paddock?  
**[0:06:32-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:32):**  Ian  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:39):**  So that's about 50 altogether.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:44):**  Ian  
**[0:06:49-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:06:49):**  Yeah, they're very much allowed space, you know, especially when it comes to shade and  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:00):**  water, they're not fighting for it, they all have their own space or in kind of comfort  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:05):**  zones, if you like, still there as well as you know, the ability to move around and graze.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:09):**  But what we're doing is trying to give them so much space that they under graze certain  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:13):**  plants and over graze others or you know that they congregate in the same place for too  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:18):**  long and cause compaction problems on a certain tree. So it's just about making sure that  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:22):**  they're in a smallish space on the ground scheme of a whole field for a short amount  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:27):**  of time where you can get greater animal impact, you'll get more trampling effect, you know,  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:31):**  they'll get rising under the hedgerows, the trees, and they'll flatten docks and nettles  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:35):**  and everything else.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:36):**  Jason And as you talk about it there, it strikes  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:38):**  me that it really is about learning the behaviour of your animals and the way that your own  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:44):**  land works. And that's why it's called adaptive multi paddock grazing, because it will change,  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:49):**  it's not going to be a set formula. Now, just I wonder how regenerative farming compares  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:54):**  with the sort of traditional farming methods that people tend to get taught, you know,  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:07:58):**  every day at agricultural college. So how does that compare in terms of the way that  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:02):**  you're managing the farm, the things you do in an average day, the way the farm looks?  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:07):**  Ian I would say regen is very much more visual.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:10):**  And as you said, adaptive and flexible is not very prescriptive. You know, you don't,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:15):**  cells aren't all the same size, and they're not all grazed for the same amount of days,  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:19):**  and you're not going into the same amount of grass and even the same residual. And that's  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:22):**  something you learn with time and experience, you kind of get your eye in of what you're  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:26):**  trying to achieve, the outcomes you want once you move the cattle out of each cell. Was  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:30):**  that the right size cell for that amount of cattle for that amount of time. And it might  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:34):**  mean that, you know, you don't always move the cattle every morning at nine o'clock,  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:38):**  maybe you move them in the morning one day, and then you move them in the afternoon another  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:41):**  day just so you get that residual that you like. Whereas I feel in conventional farming,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:46):**  it's very much more measuring and following a set of, you know, we put them in that field  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:50):**  for a week, and then we move them into another field for a week. And those fields might be  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:54):**  different sizes with different species of plants in the pastures and you know, different  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:08:57):**  grass covers and everything else. So yeah, regen is almost flipping things on its head,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:03):**  plate meters don't really work, we tend to have grass, it's too tall for plate meters  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:07):**  to function, you know, we'll be leaving enough grass behind wearing more conventional systems,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:12):**  our residual would look like what farmers put cattle into the field as their opening  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:17):**  cover. And you know, we certainly wouldn't graze as tight as many people would a more  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:22):**  conventional system.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:23):**  And Claire, you've talked to me recently about the way in which, you know, you've actually  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:27):**  brought local farmers and local people from villages around FAI onto the farm, almost  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:33):**  because, you know, people have been starting to say, that's a bit of an untidy field, that  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:37):**  grass has grown a bit high, you want to do something about that. And so you've had to  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:40):**  actually physically reach out to people around you to explain what it is that you're doing  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:44):**  so that they understand the changes on the farm.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:46):**  Absolutely. We have to just keep reminding ourselves that nature doesn't do neat. And  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:52):**  as farmers, we love neat. I don't think I ever really quite realised how much we did.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:09:57):**  But we like nice even fields that have been grazed down with no weeds and everything tidy.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:02):**  And that people do, people that live around the farm, they think that it's gone to pot  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:06):**  because we've got long grass all over the place, and we're not managing our fields.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:10):**  That's the sort of terminology that gets used, oh, you're not managing it anymore. Well,  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:14):**  actually, we are managing it in a very detailed way, but just in a different way. Ruth Layton,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:19):**  the founder of FAI was just here this morning, actually. And she says, I, you know, I do  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:23):**  understand, I do understand, I just really struggle because it looks so messy. But look  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:28):**  at all the butterflies and the insects and all the water we're holding down because it's  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:32):**  not evaporating because we've got long grass, you just have to kind of get used to what  
**[0:10:35-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:35):**  a new type of beautiful looks like.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:37):**  And that must have been difficult for you personally. I mean, you know, so I'm interested  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:41):**  in your own personal journey because you come from a fairly traditional farming background.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:45):**  So how difficult has it been for you to get your head around a regenerative approach to  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:49):**  agriculture?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:50):**  Yeah, well, I did all the things that everyone does to start with, which is like, that won't  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:54):**  work here, you know, that classic one, we can't do that on this farm. And in fact, Peter  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:10:58):**  Bick, who's been on this podcast and is the founder of Carbon Cowboys and big projects  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:03):**  in the States, I even emailed him to that effect, you know, like, this is great, Peter,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:07):**  I get that you're well respected and your work is fantastic, but it'll never work here.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:11):**  And I don't know why just over time, that's kind of worn down. I've been lucky that I've  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:16):**  had access to training and support. So through the McDonald's project, of course, if we're  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:21):**  going to transition the farm, we need to learn how to do that. And so we've had to have trainers  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:27):**  and people help us with that process, I think coaching. And I don't think without that I  
**[0:11:32-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:32):**  would have done it. But I would say now that I kind of created some new farming friends.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:39):**  So I maybe don't talk about the way that we farm now with some of my traditional farming  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:43):**  friends, I've got some kind of new farming friends as well, still have those friends,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:47):**  we just don't talk about farming in quite the same way. And so there's been a complete,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:51):**  a complete unlearn of everything I've learned at college and through my life and my dad,  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:11:55):**  who's a farm manager, through all of his life, to kind of relearn a new way and acceptance  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:01):**  of there's something different to do now. And yeah, that whole piece has been hard.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:05):**  Yeah, hard. You know, in the same way that you've had  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:08):**  to get your head around this, you've had to win the argument for regenerative agriculture  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:12):**  at FAI as well, because FAI is not just one amorphous mass of brain. There's lots of different  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:19):**  people, lots of different thoughts and ideas. So just in the same way that other farmers  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:23):**  may have to win their own family or business partners around to a new way of doing things,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:27):**  you've had to do the same. I wonder if you could talk to me a bit about the kind of pushback  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:32):**  that you've had and how you made your way through that to deliver the changes that you  
**[0:12:36-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:36):**  wanted to see. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah. So I  
**[0:12:39-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:39):**  normally say, oh, we're different because we're not a family farm, but I've actually  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:42):**  realised that we kind of are. I've got seven siblings as co-owners of FAI and we bicker  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:49):**  and argue as good as the rest of them. And we're all at a different place on our regenerative  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:54):**  journey. I've been fully immersed in it because of this project and the work that I do. So  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:12:58):**  I'm thinking differently to some of my colleagues that are in a different place. However, navigating  
**[0:13:04-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:04):**  it, that's a really interesting one and whether they might have a different view. But I think  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:09):**  it's a combination of bulldozing at times and just knowing it's the right thing to do  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:14):**  and having to do it so that you've then got something to show, because sometimes we can  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:19):**  get a bit hamstrung with lots of conversations about what might be and what does this science  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:23):**  show and how does it compare to that, to just having a sense that it's the right thing to  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:28):**  do, but also not doing too much of that. And then checking in and trying a few things,  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:34):**  I think that's it. I want to try this idea. Let's just try this and see and then review  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:38):**  and trying a few things and then looking at it. And the biggest thing has been for people  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:42):**  to see it. So of course, we've been through this transformation  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:45):**  during lockdown where we haven't been able to show people. And so I think maybe since  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:52):**  people are able to start coming and seeing it for themselves again, that's when it changes.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:13:56):**  I've seen some big changes happen when people have visited and been immersed in it and there's  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:02):**  this light bulb. Especially seeing how the farm was and seeing the farm now, it looks  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:06):**  very different. It feels different, different atmosphere even. And people to be immersed  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:11):**  in that, that's where change has happened. And winning this award with McDonald's for  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:15):**  the work that you're doing, I mean, that must have helped to get people onside.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:19):**  Yeah, no doubt. It's like, oh, okay, so it's not just Clare banging this drum. Other people  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:24):**  think this is important as well. And so that has definitely been really good, really good  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:30):**  recognition. I mean, in the last 12 months, the pace at which the conversation about regenerative  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:35):**  agriculture has picked up has just been like nothing I've ever seen so far in my lifetime,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:41):**  I think, a change that's so quick. And so getting the award has kind of cemented that  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:46):**  in that, yeah, there are organisations out there. So firstly, McDonald's committing to  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:49):**  us in the first place, really, when we first started talking about this 18 months, two  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:53):**  years ago, and back then to make that bold decision to say, yes, let's look at this.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:14:57):**  So that was the first step. And then for compassion to now ratify that with this award, it just  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:03):**  shows fantastic commitment that people are understanding it. So yeah, it's been really  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:07):**  good.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:08):**  Simon, it's not just at farm level that change has to happen, but at processor and retailer  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:13):**  level as well. And a phrase that corporates like to use is shift the dial. And do you  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:18):**  think this work and now this sustainable food and farming award from compassion will help  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:23):**  to shift the dial, not just in terms of McDonald's supply chains, but other livestock supply  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:28):**  chains as well?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:29):**  I think so there's definitely a lot more interest in what I've seen and heard out in the conventional  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:35):**  farming world. And also, as you say, further up the supply chain and what's going on in  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:38):**  region both in the UK and globally. And you know, whether that comes from a consumer level,  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:43):**  which puts pressure on retailers to start doing 100% grass fed lines and supermarkets,  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:49):**  things like that, the clarity needs to come with, they're going to start labeling things  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:54):**  as 100% grass fed and more of the supply chain is going to invest in this and probably needs  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:15:58):**  to be some kind of not necessarily certification, but making sure that what is being sold to  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:03):**  consumers as a product, 100% pasture fed, organic regenerative, whatever those farmers  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:09):**  selling that produce are achieving those outcomes. But yeah, you are right, it seems that from  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:14):**  the very big corporates right the way down to consumers in general, and I think things  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:18):**  like social media now, it's so easy and accessible for everyday people to now get a relationship  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:24):**  with agriculture that they probably couldn't have had 10 years ago because of social media,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:28):**  Instagram, podcasts. And I think once that snowball starts going, and there's always  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:33):**  conversations going around the media about climate change and food security and food  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:37):**  nutrition, inevitably regenerative agriculture is going to come into those conversations  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:42):**  and more and more people outside of farming are going to become aware of it and interested  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:46):**  in it. You hear a lot of nutritionists and well respected people in the fitness world  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:50):**  and all sorts talking about this kind of stuff, 100% pasture fed, organic, paleo and all these  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:16:56):**  different terms that those products link into farms that are farming in some form regeneratively.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:02):**  Everything that's come previously tends to be a set of standards that to be certified  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:06):**  as whatever organic or something, you just need to do this and do that or not do that  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:11):**  and have records to prove it. I think there is a regen is it all needs to be on an outcome  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:16):**  based measurement, not on a prescriptive do's and don'ts. You know, there might be multiple  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:21):**  ways of achieving a similar outcome, as long as it is physically improving your landscape  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:26):**  improving habitat, increasing carbon levels in the soil, building soil, making your farm  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:31):**  more drought tolerant, flood tolerant, more productive on lower inputs, you know, higher  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:35):**  animal welfare, all these things that regen ag seems to have a fix for. That's the outcome  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:40):**  based measurement that if there is going to be some kind of product labelled as regenerative  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:45):**  certified or something like that, those outcomes are what are measured and not a prescription  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:50):**  of how to do it. Claire, as people, we change the way that  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:53):**  we do things for many reasons, not least of which is education. And FAI has just opened  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:17:58):**  a new online training portal, the FAI.academy. I was on it the other day and it looks, it  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:03):**  looks fantastic. It's a really impressive website with a great offer. And I wonder if  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:08):**  you could just tell us a little bit more about the academy, for example, who the training  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:12):**  is aimed at and how people can access it. We're kind of trying to do something for everyone  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:18):**  that's interested in regenerative agriculture and sustainable food systems. I guess it's  
**[0:18:24-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:24):**  for people working in food supply chain or citizens that are just interested in where  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:28):**  food comes from. And we've got a kind of introductory courses or ones we're starting with are around  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:33):**  tilapia on antimicrobial use in supply chains and regenerative agriculture, but with more  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:38):**  to come in the future. And I know that there's one that you're working  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:41):**  on at the moment that's targeted at vets and how the role of the vet in the countryside  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:45):**  may change as we go forward as well. Yeah, absolutely. Regenerative agriculture  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:50):**  for people working in the veterinary profession, written by vets for vets. Yeah, we're working  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:54):**  on that at the moment. Claire, one of the new courses available  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:18:57):**  at FAI.academy is the Citizens Guide to Regenerative Agriculture. Now this is 10 hours of self-led,  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:03):**  interactive multimedia training tailored, as you were saying, for anybody that's interested  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:08):**  in food and where it comes from. Could you tell us a bit more specifically about that  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:12):**  course and about the discount that you're offering for farm gate listeners?  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:15):**  Yeah, I think it's a great course. Firstly, just to say about our regenerative agriculture  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:20):**  courses that we've written them after our early years of experience on the farm. So  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:25):**  it's a kind of combination of information that's out there, technical information, other  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:29):**  people's experiences, but also our experiences here that have kind of filled into that. So  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:34):**  it's a kind of real and living course. And our Citizens Guide to Regenerative Agriculture,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:41):**  we're really excited to launch that because people are what make change and people out  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:47):**  there want to know more and want to make different decisions about their food. So in order to  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:52):**  help people understand, because the area is really complicated and it can be, feel confusing,  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:19:57):**  we've developed the course and we're offering 35% off for farm gate listeners. You just  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:03):**  need to go to FAI.academy, select the Citizens Guide course, and then use the code farm gate  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:09):**  when you register to get your 35% discount.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:11):**  Which is fantastic. Now Claire, I want to spend a bit of time thinking about the outcomes,  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:16):**  you know, that we were talking about earlier and how you actually monitor change. And you've  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:20):**  mentioned the improvement to the land and to the amount of grass that's being produced,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:25):**  but how are you actually capturing data and monitoring this?  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:28):**  Well that's the kind of exciting thing about the project. That's the bit that McDonald's  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:32):**  are allowing us to do by sponsoring this programme is that we're collecting about 60 different  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:36):**  measures, so loads. And the reason we're collecting so many is so that we can identify the ones  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:40):**  that are the best proxy measures so that other people would only have wanting to roll out  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:45):**  this sort of system would only have to look at a few. They're very much in the main focus  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:50):**  on looking at our soil and looking at our land and seeing are we regenerative if we  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:54):**  ask ourselves that question. We don't know until we look if our land is regenerating.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:20:58):**  So what are those indicators? So looking at infiltration rates of the soil, looking at  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:03):**  percentage of bare soil, looking for evidence of whether water is being soaked into the  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:09):**  soil or is running off the top, little bits of compaction. We're looking at biodiversity,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:13):**  particularly around dung beetles and dung beetle activity. So the amount of time it  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:17):**  takes for our dung to break down, plus actually getting into our dung and looking at types  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:23):**  and ages of dung beetles. That's the type of things that we're monitoring.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:27):**  Is it just the dung beetles or are you measuring the number of arthropods and the number of  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:30):**  birds and butterflies and that sort of thing as well?  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:33):**  We're kind of going for indicator species. There's so much we could measure. We're going  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:37):**  for the indicator. So butterflies would be one that we are using. And the reason is that  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:42):**  there's a long ongoing study on the farm of butterflies. And so we're able to use that  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:46):**  data to see the changes over time. But it's very difficult. I've tried thinking I could  
**[0:21:51-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:51):**  look for birds, but I'm not very good at identifying them and that sort of thing. So it can be  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:55):**  difficult to monitor biodiversity, which is why we've gone with something that we can  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:21:59):**  like, what can I as a farmer myself learn and to look at and what is a good indicator.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:04):**  So if we've got good dung beetle populations, then we know that good things are happening.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:08):**  We're not doing lots of detailed measuring of all the different insects as much as we'd  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:12):**  love to, because it's a really specialist area and we want the work that we're doing  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:16):**  to be relevant and easily rolled out for other farmers.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:19):**  And how are you capturing this data? Is it all on paper?  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:21):**  It's a combination, but a lot of it is going, what we found fantastically useful is a soil  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:26):**  mentor app, because that allows you to record your location and it really easy to a scoring  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:32):**  system. So for example, on bare soil like percentages or a really like good guide to  
**[0:22:38-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:38):**  help me even learn like when I first started and I was thinking time taken for dung to  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:42):**  break down. I don't know how do I measure it? How do I go about it? So we found soil  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:45):**  mentor really, really useful for doing it. Some of it is still on paper, but yeah, soil  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:51):**  mentor in the main. And also to say we went through Savory EOV, so the Savory Institute's  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:22:56):**  ecological outcome verification in order to kind of have independent people come to the  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:00):**  farm and see that what we were doing was improving the land and that our land is definitely regenerating.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:06):**  And what's the name of that? Because I think that gives you a brand, it gives you a label  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:10):**  that you're able to use, doesn't it?  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:11):**  Yeah. Land to Market is the label, but there are only nine farms in the UK with Land to  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:17):**  Market certification or EOVs. And so it's kind of not well known yet, but Silas was  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:23):**  mentioning earlier about outcomes and set of standards. So yeah, there's nothing that  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:27):**  they write that say you must do this. They come to the farm and they assess the land  
**[0:23:31-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:31):**  and they provide training in order to help understand what you might need to do on your  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:35):**  farm to make the changes, to get the outcomes that you're looking for. So it's a totally  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:40):**  different way of certifying or thinking about the way that we manage land.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:45):**  How does the cost of being a member of the Alan Savory Land to Market system compare  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:49):**  with, for example, the costs of being part of Soil Association Organic?  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:53):**  They're about the same. We do both at the moment. I think it's still important because  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:23:57):**  people understand organic. So it's important for us from a marketing point of view. But  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:01):**  cost wise, the certification is about the same.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:03):**  Silas, one of the questions, and we touched on this just a little bit earlier on, but  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:07):**  one of the questions around AMP grazing or Adaptive Multi-Paddock grazing centres on  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:12):**  the fact that the cattle are more restricted than they would be in a standard field and  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:16):**  that this may impact on their welfare. Do you think this is actually an issue or it's  
**[0:24:21-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:21):**  rather just something that people think might be an issue?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:23):**  I think it's perceived as, you know, if you were in a hundred hectare field and you had  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:28):**  cattle restricted to the centre of that field in the middle of the summer and it's 35 degrees  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:32):**  and there was no shade and shelter, then yes. But the idea is that the keyword is adaptive.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:38):**  So our cells aren't always the same shape, the same size. I always planned that there  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:42):**  is shade and shelter. You know, they've always got access to water. They're always moving  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:47):**  out of that cell before they've run out of grass. You know, visually many farmers would  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:52):**  go in and think, oh, there's another day or two grazing in this, maybe more, but the cattle  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:24:57):**  know they want to move, but they're not irritated that they need to move. They're content. They  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:02):**  know the drill, they know the routine. They see you coming, they stand at the fence and  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:06):**  they come through and the behaviour, you know, they're very relaxed and quiet and docile.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:11):**  And because they see you every day as well, and you're moving them physically every day,  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:15):**  they get very used to people. They get very used to you and the routine and, you know,  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:19):**  linking with what Claire was saying, which is why I think farmers get so excited by this  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:23):**  stuff when they start doing it, but also people who aren't farmers that come to these farms  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:27):**  and see what's going on. As you talk about these visual clues, also the data sets and  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:32):**  the outcomes. And if you can achieve average daily live weight gains across the year of  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:36):**  1.4 kilos or more and finish animals at 16, 20 months, every day you're driving around  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:42):**  the farm, you feel like you're in a domestic safari. And, you know, that's what gets people  
**[0:25:46-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:46):**  excited. They're seeing things and whether they're barn owls or foxes and badgers and  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:52):**  insects. And I've been told there's lots of plant species that have been found here at  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:25:57):**  FAI that various people that have come to study these things have got very excited about  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:00):**  because they're very rare. And I felt I was quite good at these kinds of plant IDs. Now  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:04):**  I'm a bit like a school kid again, there's so many of them there. I don't know what most  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:08):**  of them are. You know, we might not be measuring all of that, but if I'm going out every day  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:12):**  and it's an exciting environment to be in and I'm seeing things that make you feel good,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:16):**  you're seeing nature and you're seeing ecosystems working and thriving as well as achieving  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:21):**  these efficiencies in terms of daily live weight gains and soil health, then there's  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:25):**  a no brainer why this all adds up and people do get very invested in it.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:29):**  And when you're seeing an increasing diversity in the sward, I mean, we've talked about health  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:35):**  and welfare. These things are very interconnected, aren't they? And as you have more plants growing,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:38):**  you're attracting in different insects and some insects which will predate on others.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:42):**  And therefore you're likely to, it's self medication sort of makes it sound a bit hippie,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:47):**  but actually what you're doing is creating, restoring balance in there so that you have  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:51):**  healthier animals. And that in itself means that there is better welfare.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:26:56):**  Exactly. The more diversity in the pastures as well as having access to browse on hedgerows  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:00):**  and trees, you know, every plant plays its role in an ecosystem, whether that's the greater  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:05):**  breaking up soil compaction or the very high minerals or tannins. Cattle know what plants  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:10):**  to go to to self medicate and the more diversity you can achieve, the more opportunity they  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:14):**  have to self medicate. And again, that links in with your own input cost reduced because  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:19):**  there's less need for vet med and mineral costs. And yeah, that whole ecosystem approach  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:24):**  that you said, you just create the habitat for those insects and the whole supply, the  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:28):**  whole food chain above that benefits, which is why you get this whole mosaic of wildlife  
**[0:27:33-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:33):**  from the top of the chain to the bottom and everything is just working in tandem and sync  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:36):**  with nature. And you mentioned hedges there. And of course,  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:39):**  being able to display natural behaviour is the cornerstone of measuring and monitoring  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:44):**  farm animal welfare. And I understand that you've been actually taking fences down so  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:49):**  that the animals are able to access the hedges and you know, there's a greater range of nutrition  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:55):**  within the hedge itself. And they're also bringing some of those nutrients back out  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:27:58):**  into the field. Exactly. And the key is, is that we're not  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:01):**  allowing animals to stay in the same place for so long that they end up damaging a hedgerow  
**[0:28:06-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:06):**  or end up damaging a tree. You know, they're probably only there in and around it for a  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:09):**  day, maybe three, four at the absolute most. And it's all comes back to that visualisation,  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:15):**  move them before things become a problem, move them before they overgraze, move them  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:20):**  before they damage a hedgerow, slip and go in for hours a little bit, move there onto  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:24):**  the next cell and the next hedgerow. And then they're not coming back to that cell, which  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:28):**  is a big key of it is the recovery periods that follow these short term grazing, not  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:32):**  coming back to that cell for 40, 50, 60 days, even more, sometimes we might leave an area  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:38):**  to rest for six months. And that is really important here to achieve those outcomes of  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:44):**  that soil health and the biodiversity and recovery and the deep root systems and the  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:48):**  huge amounts of biomass you can then grow above the soil as well.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:51):**  And from that perspective, it sounds as though physically being on the quad bike or walking  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:28:56):**  in and around the farm on a daily basis is really important to understanding the stage  
**[0:29:02-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:02):**  that a particular paddock or a particular animal is at, you know, on any given day of  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:06):**  the year. And so it's, it's really, it's putting the human back into farming, which is fantastic.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:11):**  So one of the things that FAI does is to take risks, learn from the process and then communicate  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:17):**  that knowledge so that other farmers are able to make changes with more confidence. In terms  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:21):**  of regenerative agriculture, how important do you think that role is in terms of making  
**[0:29:27-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:27):**  a national and global transition?  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:29):**  It's massively important because in my opinion, the agricultural food system in the last hundred  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:35):**  years is dysfunctional. It's producing food that's less nutrient dense in a way that is  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:40):**  degrading land and having a negative impact on habitats and polluting waterways and everything  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:45):**  else. So if we need to shift away from that and do something different, you have to take  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:49):**  risks. You have to do things that maybe farmers haven't done in the last few generations.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:53):**  A lot of regen act as new thinking, a lot of it is embedded in old traditions, but maybe  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:29:58):**  now with a bit more understanding about the processes and the science and the biology.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:02):**  Another good thing with regen is it is snowballing and there is a lot of it going on in places  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:06):**  like the States and Australia and places like that that have much more, you know, they're  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:11):**  under more pressure climate wise, they're much drier, hotter. They need to do something  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:15):**  different. They've been forced to do it. And it is much easier to follow suit or follow  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:20):**  to take those first steps of shifting to regen ag when you hear about people that have been  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:25):**  doing it for 20, 30 years and you hear their stories about how things on their farms have  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:29):**  improved and what they've done and how they've achieved that. And yeah, it's a very important  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:34):**  point, but it is also difficult to take what someone has done in central Australia and  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:39):**  maybe that's not the same way that you would do that in the UK. So it's very important  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:43):**  that you find what works in your environment, in your system, on your farm and take little  
**[0:30:47-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:47):**  bits and learn from other people that have been doing similar things around the world.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:51):**  So it's not just about reducing your own costs, increasing your own profits and increasing  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:30:57):**  the breadth of wildlife on FAI's farm itself. It's about de-risking regenerative agriculture  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:03):**  for other farmers who are able to learn from what you're doing. It's fascinating to hear  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:07):**  the way that you're describing it there Silas. Claire, just finally, we've talked about the  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:11):**  nuts and bolts of AMP grazing today and about some of the outcomes, but for you as a human  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:17):**  being, I wonder, you know, cause you came from that mainstream background, do you feel  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:22):**  that your relationship with your livestock and with the land has changed as a result  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:27):**  of your transition to regen agriculture? Certainly. Yeah, it's kind of more than changed. It's  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:32):**  sort of completely overhauled. I just look at everything so differently. When I look  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:37):**  at animals and the land now, I'm looking for feedback. So it's like Silas said earlier,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:42):**  we grazed that for a bit too long, but we had to leave them in there cause we needed  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:46):**  to bring them in for TB testing or something like that. How has that been different? How  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:50):**  does that recover in the weeks to come and what is it telling us? When I see weeds now,  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:54):**  when I see things I'm not used to, it's like, what does that mean? What's that telling us?  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:31:58):**  When you see the animals with maybe there's some that are holding onto their summer coat  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:02):**  a bit more, why is that happening? What is it about our system that's not in balance?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:06):**  It's totally changed my relationship and I view it completely differently. Humphrey who  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:10):**  worked with us used to say that when you start seeing things differently, the things that  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:15):**  you see change and that totally sums it up for me. When I look out across the field now,  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:20):**  I'm looking for different things and I see different things. As a human being, what's  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:24):**  changed for me is that I felt before like we were on a treadmill and it was always this  
**[0:32:30-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:30):**  next lambing, it can't be as wet, it won't be as wet, we won't have this worm problem  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:33):**  next year, this will be better, we'll tweak that here and we'll tweak that there and we  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:37):**  won't have the same problem. Just new problems kept arising and it was like this never-ending  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:41):**  whirlwind. Whereas now, it just feels, I mean, we still work hard and there's a lot to do,  
**[0:32:47-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:47):**  but it just feels like there's a bit of space and we're excited because we know that we  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:51):**  can look forward to things. So, even if we have the wettest winter on record, that's  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:55):**  okay because we've planned for it and we do it in a different way now that means that  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:32:58):**  we're not relying on it not being the wettest winter on record in order to survive. So,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:33:03):**  in summary, very long answer there, but it's completely changed my relationship with animals  
**[0:33:08-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:33:08):**  and the land. Thank you so much and I love the word that  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:33:10):**  you used at the beginning of your answer which was conversation. I love the idea of it being  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Award-winning-adaptive-multi-paddock-grazing-e144d4f#t=0:33:15):**  an ongoing conversation with the livestock and the land. Thank you both, that's all we

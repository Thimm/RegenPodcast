### Farm Gate  (2022-01-26)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn LoKusteyn, the chief executive of Farmwell and founder  of the Food and Global Security Network.  Carbon farming is on the rise, both in response to the pressing need to mitigate global warming,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:00:18):**  but also because an improved understanding of natural capital assets has allowed farmers  and other land managers to monetise increased carbon sequestration and storage on their  properties.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:00:29):**  How does the carbon market work? Is sequestration and storage taking priority over the restoration  of other natural capital assets? And is there a danger that great tracts of land could be  lost from food production as a result of more ambitious carbon reduction targets?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:00:44):**  To address these issues and more, I'm joined from Scotland by Charlie Davies, a natural  capital advisor specialising in the management of natural assets for Savills, the farm's  estates and agricultural land agents.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:00:56):**  Charlie, welcome to Farmgate.  Thank you, Finn LoKusteyn.  Perhaps we could start with a broad overview and with the caveat, of course, that every  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:01:03):**  territory is different. Could you explain how the carbon market works in Scotland in  terms of land management?  It's a big topic, so I'll just provide a little bit of context. The Savills Natural  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:01:14):**  Capital team in Scotland is made up of estate managers who specialise in advising clients  in the management of their rural businesses, with a particular eye to the sustainability  of those businesses and the environmentally-led management of their natural assets. And we  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:01:26):**  have conversations every day and increasingly so with a range of businesses across Scotland  who are looking for support into where to start with approaching managing their natural  assets in a way that enhances the environment and some of whom are well on their way to  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:01:39):**  adopting the kind of approach as a core tenet of their management. And the markets that  are arising are really a big part of that and a big part of the advice that we give  them. And for some of these rural businesses, the changes that they make will be quite small,  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:01:52):**  but quite significant in the context of their business and potentially in the way that they  manage their farm businesses and the way that they manage their uplands and also their property  portfolios and all sorts of different habitats that they might have on their holdings. And  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:02:04):**  for others, their approach is much more ambitious and results in landscape-scale changes and  adoption of environment management across all aspects of their business. And these are  the kind of high-profile changes that you've probably heard about, where large pieces of  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:02:19):**  land are really transforming in a significant way from one kind of land use to another.  We're really here to talk about carbon and carbon markets, but I think it's important  to provide a bit of context to that conversation. And I work under the banner of natural capital,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:02:33):**  which I think can be quite an unhelpful phrase because it's quite nebulous, but it kind of  encapsulates all of this. It encapsulates the carbon markets and it encapsulates other  payments for ecosystem services that are emerging. It encapsulates partnerships between different  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:02:46):**  kinds of organisations to try and stimulate environmental change or environmentally positive  action. And it also encapsulates all of the more internal environmental management that  rural businesses need to consider now around their own liabilities and what they're doing  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:03:00):**  to make sure that they are contributing to the environment and continue to be resilient  as businesses in a marketplace.  When you talk about the sustainability of businesses, clearly within that, environmental  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:03:11):**  sustainability, the sustainability of that whole natural asset, is in your view critical  to that business being sustainable in the long term.  So, rural business managers have traditionally really been there to support the ongoing viability  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:03:26):**  of the businesses that they help to manage. Environmental sustainability sits side by  side with that financial sustainability.  And in terms of the carbon market itself, how does that work?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:03:37):**  That's a big question. And for me, I think it's important to understand what the mechanism  of the carbon market is. And I think that it's really a mechanism for society at large  to vote with their money for the kind of land management and the kind of land use that they  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:03:53):**  want to see. So, natural capital and carbon markets and other markets for ecosystem services  are a way for private funding to be funnelled into a sector to motivate a particular set  of behaviours.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:04:07):**  And I think it's against the backdrop of the fact that we are facing a climate and environmental  crisis and there isn't enough public funding really available to fund everything that we  need to do at pace to deal with the kind of outcomes that we're already seeing from climate  
**[0:04:21-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:04:21):**  change and biodiversity breakdown. So, there needs to be, and we're glad that there is,  a push, a drive coming from the private market to also help fund these changes that we need  to see.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:04:33):**  You've mentioned quite a few different drivers there. You talked about people being able  to vote with their money. So, that's kind of the basic citizen. And then there's public  funding coming in there as well. There's the urgency of climate change. And I wonder, in  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:04:45):**  your view, what are the key drivers, or is there a key driver in terms of developing  that market for carbon farming? Is the push primarily coming from business or from Scottish  government or from the landowners and managers themselves or from citizens? Is there a hierarchy  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:04:59):**  there, or is the push kind of coming from everybody all at once?  I think that's a really, really interesting question. To speak very broadly, I think the  pressure, the driver is coming from you and I, the consumer and the general public. And  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:05:09):**  it's to do with public perception, it's to do with the importance of public perception,  it's to do with consumer behaviour. But in terms of the touch points that I encounter  for our clients who are land managers, the conversation has already evolved, I think,  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:05:21):**  beyond a rather obtuse approach to carbon and other ecosystem service markets, which  was, you know, this is an opportunity to make some more money or get paid to do something.  It's now shifted, I think, to a bit more of a nuanced picture around risk. Land managers  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:05:35):**  are putting climate resilience on their risk register as they come to better understand  the impact of extreme weather events and the changing environment on their business and  their business operations. There's also, this I think is particularly characteristic of  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:05:47):**  our Scottish client base, I apologise, I work in Scotland and so that's the backdrop that  I come from. And there's a recognition that with ownership and stewardship of a natural  asset comes a level of responsibility and the stewards of the land, land managers have  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:06:01):**  a responsibility not only to look after that land and the creatures within it, but also  to demonstrate that responsible land management is happening to the wider public. They have  a kind of obligation to be transparent and to communicate those goods that they are producing  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:06:14):**  to the wider public. That comes in the context of quite a lot of public scrutiny of rural  business managers that have happened here. Land managers also noticing a real shift in  appetites of their buyers and this is where we come in effectively and where they have  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:06:27):**  a direct relationship to them, they've got that message loud and clear and where they  interact through a supply chain. That message is coming and increasingly coming from those  businesses along that supply chain, so supermarkets we've heard have made pledges to require various  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:06:40):**  levels of environmental disclosure from their suppliers with a view in the future to carbon  neutrality and I'm sure beyond that, you know, much more nuanced requirements around the  way that their suppliers' land is managed. And finally, and quite crucially, particularly  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:06:55):**  here in particular the kind of rural businesses that we manage, a driver is access to borrowing  and we've had conversations with banks where they've explicitly said that climate and environmental  resilience is going to be a key determinant on how they assess eligibility for loans,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:07:08):**  if not now in the very near future. I'm really interested in what you were talking  about there with banks and bank loans and I guess that sort of links back to one of  those earlier points you were making around risk and risk management. The banks don't  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:07:21):**  want to have stranded assets, they don't want to be owed money because the farm business  has failed because it hasn't managed to, you know, keep its land in good condition. How  does that work when we're talking about risk? What do we mean by risk?  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:07:36):**  I think it's risk in a number of different contexts really. It is the physical risk that  things like loss of soil and loss of habitat and wildfire and extreme weather events. We've  just had a very extreme weather event up here that I'm sure your listeners will have picked  
**[0:07:52-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:07:52):**  up on. Storm Irwin has affected a lot of our clients' properties where they have woodland  and effective access routes in and out of our clients' businesses and represents quite  a large loss of value. That's a risk. So, that's a climate-related risk. If we start  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:08:09):**  to see those kind of weather events on a greater scale and we start to see it depleting the  resilience of our businesses because we're having to spend money resolving these issues  as they come down the line because we aren't resilient enough to either have preempted  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:08:22):**  them or done what we could to make sure that the impact was mitigated. That's a pretty  straightforward way of thinking about it.  And that's around adaptation, I guess, is it? So, it's making sure that your land and  
**[0:08:32-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:08:32):**  property is resilient to the impacts of climate change.  Absolutely. And then there's risks in terms of, as I mentioned, in terms of the supply  chain and who's going to be buying your products and potentially being left behind when there  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:08:46):**  is a demand for people to have done some work, some groundwork in demonstrating their environmental  status and their positive environmental impact.  And you mentioned retailers in relation to that. In your experience, is that coming from  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:08:59):**  the majority of retailers now? That it's not just the Waitrose's at the top, that we're  seeing that from, you know, the Tesco's and Asda's of the world as well?  Definitely are. And they're approaching it in different ways. So, you end up comparing  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:09:10):**  apples and pears to some extent, but each of the big supermarket brands that we are  familiar with have made pledges to a greater or lesser extent around carbon neutrality  and ESG. We're seeing people like Sainsbury's working with farmers within a catchment and  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:09:25):**  ensuring that they have climate resilience within that catchment area and doing pilots  and they're working out what they want to do, really, I think. And they're looking over  at each other and watching what each of them are doing and committing to, but they are  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:09:39):**  making big commitments.  Charlie, that's been a fantastic sort of opening, really explaining, you know, the way that  the carbon market works, the drivers that exist there. One sort of question that's kind  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:09:50):**  of remaining, I suppose, in my mind is who's actually buying and selling the carbon? Is  it big companies buying through agencies or are farmers, you know, going out and peddling  their carbon kind of, you know, at a local farmers market? How does that actually work?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:10:04):**  And actually, when we talk about carbon sequestration, are we largely talking about tree planting  or is soil management increasingly part of that storage offer as well?  Two big questions there in terms of the literal way in which the carbon market works. The  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:10:18):**  carbon market is based around carbon codes. And at the moment, we have a woodland carbon  code. And we also have a peatland carbon code. And the woodland carbon code relates to verifiable  sequestration that's achieved by growing a woodland that didn't previously exist and  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:10:34):**  the carbon that's represented in that biomass of those trees. And that is traded on something  called the voluntary carbon market, which is literally a digital platform that you can  go on to. People have accounts and they have third party verified carbon units on their  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:10:48):**  accounts and people can come in and they can do a deal.  So, it's sort of like Amazon Marketplace.  It is a bit, but what I think importantly, are seeing, and I think this is maybe what's  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:10:58):**  kind of scared people is that people think of it as quite an anonymous marketplace where  people are coming in and they're buying carbon from places that, you know, we call it kind  of off the shelf carbon trading. But actually, the reality and the kind of deals that I'm  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:11:13):**  involved in and my colleagues are involved in tend to be much more around a relationship  between two organisations. Markets for ecosystem services have particularly carbon being criticised  and I think portrayed unfairly in the media as exactly as you say, horse trading. And  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:11:28):**  because there is no set price, it's a free market and you pay what you're willing to  pay for the carbon effectively. And people are concerned about that and how anonymous  they can be. But my own experience working with managers and institutions and corporate  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:11:44):**  emitters actually is much more nuanced. The emitters are kind of understanding that no  two tonnes of carbon are the same and that there are benefits to be gained from having  a relationship with someone that they trust, a partner that they trust, a partner that  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:11:59):**  they can include in a storyline about the work that they're doing, the offsets that  they're using to demonstrate their high quality and also all of these other aspects. There's  governance piece, this social impact piece and the environmental piece way beyond just  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:12:13):**  an emissions reduction, but actually around creating habitat, creating carbon resilience  and how it fits into the bigger picture around how that land is being managed responsibly.  So yes, it's a platform on which you can go and effectively trade and people are trading.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:12:30):**  This is a global thing. There are lots of different codes which have different standards.  We are very lucky that the Woodland Code and the Peatland Code are of a very, very high  standard. The eligibility criteria are very high.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:12:40):**  And are those government codes?  No, they're not government codes, but they're set up by the IHS Marketplace, which is an  IUCN backed market platform. And they require a third party verification so that you know  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:12:54):**  that these tonnes of carbon do exist and they will continue to exist and they're verified  at certain points.  Charlie, I'm fascinated by this idea that there isn't actually a fixed price. I guess,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:13:05):**  like anything else that you're selling, that it depends on quality, it depends on the verification,  but how is the price of a carbon tonne decided? Is it simply just left to the market, to buyers  and sellers to convince each other? And I wonder what sort of factors come into play there?  
**[0:13:22-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:13:22):**  You know, things like how the carbon has been sequestered, the ability to verify the vulnerability  of that carbon asset, what sort of things?  You're absolutely right. So the carbon market is a free market and the carbon price is determined  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:13:36):**  by how much someone is willing to pay for that carbon. So really, if we use my earlier example  of a business who has emissions and liability and they want to offset that, really it's  about what they have decided the value of that carbon offset is to them. They will have that  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:13:52):**  carbon emission on their risk register and they need to decide what in the context of  their business the value is that they would put on having that emission written off effectively.  And that will vary between different organisations. Crucially, the voluntary carbon market shouldn't  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:14:09):**  be confused with the compliance market, which is the framework for businesses who have a statutory  obligation to offset their emissions and they can purchase carbon. And that carbon price is set and  it was set by the EU when we were part of the European Union and now it's set in the UK.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:14:23):**  And voluntary markets function entirely distinctly from that compliance market. And some interesting  research has been undertaken into what the carbon price really should be if we were properly  reflecting the value of the impact of that tonne of carbon on society. And that price is quite  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:14:41):**  high in the hundreds of pounds. The current carbon price, what people are paying changes a lot, as  you can imagine, because this is an emerging market, but the current carbon price isn't there  yet. And demand is creeping up. So the price is creeping up as people effectively have made 25th.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:14:56):**  We've seen so many 2050 or 2045 pledges around carbon neutrality. And I think a lot of people  made those kinds of pledges before they'd really got into the guts of how they were going to  achieve that. It's really interesting. It strikes me as perhaps less like  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:15:10):**  Amazon marketplace, a bit more like eBay, or even more, it's like the housing market where  you're kind of putting your house on the market, you choose the estate agent you're going with,  because they have a particular reputation that's associated with them, either at kind of the cheap  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:15:28):**  houses or the posh houses. And having kind of pitched your price, whatever that is, the people  then come along and haggle and say, well, you know, we've done a survey and there's some  silence there. So we want to knock that price down that there's actually, it feels quite similar to  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:15:43):**  the housing market. I think that's a good analogy, you know, I suppose the other aspect that you  don't have in the housing market is that the people who are selling the house or hypothetical  house are also, they're not going to then move and disappear to another house. They're really  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:15:56):**  entering into a partnership with the people, with the potential buyers, that's going to last,  you know, these schemes last for between 30 and 100 years, and sometimes more.  Mason So more like a rental agreement.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:16:07):**  Bridgette Like a rental, and in the same way as a rental agreement,  both sides are wanting to be as discerning as possible. You know, they really want these people  to be squeaky clean when it comes to what it is they're doing, because there's an association  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:16:19):**  there. And frankly, landowners in Scotland, they've got used to coming under quite a lot of scrutiny.  And the dynamic now is that yes, they want to participate in these things, because they're going  to facilitate them doing really good things for the environment, potentially within their within  
**[0:16:35-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:16:35):**  their holdings, but they are so careful, they are so careful about who they want to partner up with.  This is really where our advice comes in, making sure that they do their due diligence on anyone  that they partner up with making sure that they have shared principles that they have shared  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:16:50):**  aspirations that they care about the same kind of things, they're going to co design often a scheme,  which is going to have lots of co benefits, they're going to co design with our help, often  a monitoring programme to make sure that those co benefits, not only the sequestration of carbon,  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:17:05):**  but all of the other benefits are measured over time over the whole of the scheme,  to make sure that everyone is benefiting everyone's achieving what they promised that  they would achieve when they set up. Now, presumably, as part of your work,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:17:16):**  you're helping landowners to assess the impact of their existing land use, before they can then sell,  you know, additionality in relation to the natural capital assets. So what tools are you using for  that? And how does that information then contribute to an assessment of how much carbon can be sold  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:17:34):**  externally? Carbon is really the first step and is a kind of central pillar of this. And although  we do try and incorporate as much as we can other assessments, and we're doing this more and more  and more as people's ideas about environmental impact are becoming more sophisticated,  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:17:48):**  but assessing the environmental status, particularly in terms of carbon of your rural  businesses has to be the first step of any of these conversations, as you rightly point out,  it informs the environmental strategy that the business will adopt. But because understanding  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:18:01):**  your carbon status isn't yet a statutory obligation for rural businesses, and although I'm  sure it will be soon, and there are a number of ways out there for assessing the environmental  status business, a number of calculators, and a number of ways that people can help you understand  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:18:15):**  that. So it can be quite difficult to cut through the noise on all of those different calculators.  And we've worked with a range of businesses to assess their environmental status. And as you  can imagine, they vary massively in their scale and what makes up that business. And so we've  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:18:27):**  adopted a bit of a different approach for each different operations, different land holdings,  different geography, different diversifications. So different calculators are available and  different ones will be suited to different businesses. But we've worked quite closely  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:18:40):**  with the farm carbon toolkit to adapt their farm emissions tool to a wider range of businesses.  And that's been really helpful as a starting point, because what you're really aiming for  is a set of consistent emissions status reports over time that show the trajectory that that  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:18:54):**  business is going on as it adopts management changes.  Mason. And of course, when you're calculating how much carbon is being sequestered in order  to be able to sell those carbon credits, the emissions are really important. But in terms  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:19:05):**  of understanding the impact of a farm business, particularly a ruminant farm business, it's not  just the emissions that are important, but the warming that's important as well. So I think  within those calculators, there's an ability to assess not just the emissions using the GWP 100  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:19:20):**  metric, but also the warming impact using GWP star, which then gives a much broader picture  through that dual reporting approach of the impact of that farm business and therefore,  the kind of actions that are sensible for them to take.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:19:33):**  Hannah  Absolutely. It's about identifying carbon intensity. And for broad strokes management,  you need to get hold of a number you're going to have as a consistent methodology over time.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:19:43):**  And then you need to use that to identify where your carbon intensity is, and then focus your  energy on managing that. Just to go back to something you said a bit earlier about registration  of carbon sequestration, we do incorporate carbon sequestration within our farm audits and our  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:19:59):**  rural business audits. But there's a really important distinction here, which is between  the process by which you understand your carbon status and include the sequestration that the  biomass that exists on your holding is achieving each year, which is perfectly possible. And you  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:20:11):**  can choose that include that in your carbon emissions balance to inform your decisions going  forward. And you can even put that into the public sphere and say, look, this is the methodology that  we've used. And this is what we understand our carbon status to be. The registration,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:20:25):**  a third party registration of carbon is quite a separate process. And we would encourage that you  do the emissions balance process first and understand what your status is, and then work  to reduce your emissions where they are avoidable through efficiencies and changing management  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:20:40):**  practices and really concentrating on that. You can also look in parallel at increasing the biomass  that you have on the ground whether that's improving health or increasing margins or changing  the way you manage your grassland or looking for opportunities to plant woodland or encourage  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:20:53):**  woodland. But that is quite a separate process to when you've got to that point. And then you say,  okay, do we still have a lot of liability? Or do we have a surplus potentially, but that surplus  can only be traded and used to support other businesses if you have registered it in order  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:21:09):**  to do that. It needs to meet the quite stringent criteria of the woodland carbon code, for example,  and that would require you to meet additionality, eligibility and also permanence.  Jason Vale,  
**[0:21:17-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:21:17):**  Let's go on to that verification sort of piece, if we may, because I think, you know, when we  think about trees, we can actually see them growing and we can see them physically existing  over time in a landscape. It's quite straightforward. I mean, it's, you know, not just  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:21:34):**  with the woodland carbon code, which obviously, you know, puts a framework in place, but just  as an average citizen, you can see that you have a picture in your mind of this carbon storage  that's happening in relation to trees. With soil sequestration, it's less visual, and for that  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:21:49):**  matter, possible degradation of the carbon stores, also less easy to see. So what is the longevity  of a carbon credit? Is it something that's meant to represent permanent ongoing forever storage?  And how is that ongoing storage monitored? Or is it kind of, you know, it's stored for 40 years?  
**[0:22:06-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:22:06):**  Or how does it work?  So it kind of sits in parallel with the policy that already exists. But the woodland carbon code isn't yet sophisticated enough to factor in lifecycle emissions for timber extracted from a scheme that has been a carbon scheme. And then after that scheme has finished, you then have a woodland. And if there is, if there's timber extracted from that woodland, then we're not yet at a point where the code is sophisticated enough to factor that in, although they, I know that they are working on that. And that can feel like that's not quite right. Because really, what we're doing is we're paying for carbon to be sequestered  forever. And that's the feeling that we have when we have a woodland carbon unit. The reality is, and this is something that I have come to kind of realize, having found that quite a difficult point to get my head around, is that what we're seeing in these schemes, they are permanent, because they are woodlands that they don't exist on land that could be used for commercial timber, frankly, because commercial timber is still and particularly with timber prices, as they are now the most lucrative use for land that can grow trees. So they're existing in this marginal  
**[0:23:36-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:23:36):**  ground, usually mid hill, where they're probably not going to grow particularly fast and particularly thick and fast. And it's going to be most suitable for native woodland. The additional requirements mean that actually, the only thing you can really do under a wooden carbon scheme is create native woodland on kind of marginal ground. And the reality of those kind of woodlands is that they are not producing timber that is commercially interesting. So they are going to be there forever, because by the time the scheme ends, you've got a mature native woodland with no timber value. So policy, forestry policy needs to be made.  That means that you can't then take that out without restocking it. So that sets off the woodland permanence question. But when we talk about...  Actually, just before we go on to the soil, I just wanted to come back on that woodland point, because that's really interesting, because I think a lot of people when they think about carbon sequestration and woodland being planted for carbon, they would see that as being fir trees, as you know, sort of plantations for timber effectively, that then get harvested in due course. So it's really interesting that it's not actually it's broadleaf deciduous, or a mix that's appropriate to that land.  
**[0:24:35-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:24:35):**  It's very distinct. And I think this is I think you're absolutely right, this is a common misconception. If you are planting woodland in a plantation kind of style, you will not meet the additionality requirements. And additionality just briefly, and I'm sure listeners have probably be aware of this, but additionality is the requirement that any woodland that is registered under under the woodland carbon code would not be commercially viable without carbon funding. That means that as soon as you start putting in, frankly, trees in any kind of density that are going to be really successful, and that are going to grow quite quickly,  and be very straight, then you're wiping out your eligibility, you have to demonstrate that this wouldn't have happened anyway, really, it's the simplest way of explaining additionality on soil permanence. And I think this is the reason why we don't have a soil carbon code yet. Or it's certainly a key reason is because the issue of permanence is so much more complicated when it comes to soil, because carbon storage in soil can be reversed a hell of a lot more quickly than carbon storage in timber biomass. You know, even if you cut a tree down, and you turn it into a building, you've still stored the carbon. With soil, you can  it can be released, you know, with one one round of ploughing, you can release carbon, and then it can be taken a very long time to get that back again. So not only have we struggled really to find consistent ways of measuring soil carbon, but also building a framework that has a mechanism that will ensure permanence of carbon storage within soil that is still being used for farming operations is very, very difficult. And my guess is, is as good as yours, I'm afraid on how they're going to do that. And I suspect that soil carbon code that we have been promised, but what we'll  
**[0:26:04-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:26:04):**  find is that it actually takes probably quite a different form to the woodland carbon code and the peatland carbon code that we're quite familiar with now, because they're going to have to come up with some mechanism within that framework that allows for permanence or skirts around it. And I'm fascinated to see how they how they've resolved that one.  Thanks, Charlie. I want to move on now to the sort of the broader landscape. And of course, carbon is just one part of any farm's natural capital, but it's also one of the easiest to monetise. And you talked about the need for joined up thinking around sustainable land use. So how do you how does Savills approach the need to deliver broader sustainability, and the regeneration of all natural capital through this funding model where money is primarily coming in through the carbon market?  So in some ways, we're helped by the fact that as I mentioned before, the market is increasingly discerning. So the buyers of carbon are actually looking for a much more well rounded approach to environmental management. And when they are considering investing in this scheme, they're expecting us to be able to demonstrate a much broader approach, a much more nuanced approach to environmental management that goes beyond this is how much carbon and that are sequestering.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:27:14):**  I work under the banner of natural capital, which is potentially quite a nebulous phrase and can be unhelpful because people don't really know what it what it means. But actually, it can be quite good because what it does is it doesn't narrow the focus too early on in my conversations with people. I'm not a carbon broker, I don't have carbon in my job ties. And I'm relieved about that, because actually, some of the most interesting conversations I have aren't about carbon, they're about all of the other things that can be brought in by something that maybe is facilitated at root by a carbon based investment.  But actually, there's this whole ecosystem around it of other benefits that can be achieved. And really what we want to focus on when we're talking to our clients and moving us from that is this an opportunity that we should be involved in? How can I be involved in it financially? Two are much more nuanced, one about all the things we talked about risk and climate resilience and access to markets and being good stewards.  Really, I want to talk about good environmental management and good environmental management in the context of rural businesses will achieve any number of outcomes that fall under that title of natural capital. And it's actually quite rare to be able to affect one and not have it have it knock on and affect other things. But it's important to understand what those knock on effects are and understand and measure and make credible those those other effects. So an example that I've used in the past and something that hopefully is a good way of elucidating this is to think about the habitats that you have on your farm. So you might have a farm that's not really a good way of doing it.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:28:33):**  So you might have hedges and within those hedges, you might have trees and some shrub land and things around those hedges, and they are performing a really, really important function. And when we conduct a carbon audit on rural business, we look at all the operations and fuel used and all of the perennial biomass that's sequestering carbon. And that includes those hedgerows, as well as all the embodied carbon of the buildings and the inputs, etc.  But for hedges, we can calculate the sequestration that a hedge is achieving and could achieve if it were allowed to take on more biomass. And that's with a view that actually the benefit that those hedges will provide go way beyond just the carbon sequestration that we're suggesting. We're using the carbon audit as the stimuli for changing the way that we manage hedges, maybe flailing them every other year, rather than every year and reducing your fuel costs and increasing the biomass of those hedges and having a bit more of a strategy around hedge management to increase their density.  But the benefits they're having in terms of moderating the climate across your fields and moderating the water flow across fields and providing wildlife corridors and providing pollen for pollinators, all of these other benefits are part of this and shouldn't be ignored, even though maybe the base stimuli for the change in management is the carbon question, the carbon management question.  
**[0:29:49-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:29:49):**  So it's emblematic of the way in which we try and approach everything. And that includes woodland creation and restoration and any changes to farming operations. They all have these other knock on effects for biodiversity, hydrology and climate resilience.  We're coming to the end of the programme. And one of the questions that comes up when I'm talking to other people in Scotland is that there's a perception, at least, that we're seeing an increase in what they call green lairs. People buying up tracts of land specifically to grow forests and sell carbon credits or indeed to rewild. And I wonder if this rings true with you, whether and how you think the land market is changing?  I think that's a really, really important question, as you say, particularly in Scotland because of the scale, but also the political context that we've talked about earlier. There's no doubt and we've seen it already that the introduction of these markets in their nascencies is affecting the way that people interact with land and the opportunities that come up.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:30:42):**  I think that this will happen. I think we'll see this more. I think we will see some more acquisitions made by people who haven't previously been interested in the land market and who are interested in it now because they're interested in locking in effectively their own supply of carbon.  Hopefully also some other ecosystem services as well. So I think we will see it and we've seen it already, but perhaps because our starting point or my starting point is as a rural business manager, we really want to support them to deliver something else that will feel like they're contributing to the health and resilience of the land that they live and work on.  And what I hope is that the market will become more nuanced and those, even if there are some acquisitions that take place and then those landscapes change, as we've discussed, they won't be changed into plantations because that's not the way this works.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:31:32):**  They'll be changed hopefully into some pretty well designed landscape scale habitats that will benefit biodiversity. But if that doesn't happen, the market is being engaged in by all sorts of different people and there remains a real heterogeneity in the kind of people who are conducting rural businesses in Scotland.  And I think that will continue. And ultimately, all of the interactions around the carbon market and the ecosystem services market are driven by what the buyers want. And the private market for ecosystem services is really a way for people to invest in something that they think is really, really good.  And as I say, buyers are becoming more sophisticated. We do have a land ownership problem in Scotland. Land ownership and control over what happens on the land is very concentrated in the hands of a very small group of people in Scotland.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:32:20):**  And while the government finds its way to ease that pressure in an equitable way, I am very interested in supporting people to make decisions over the use and character of their land that delivers climate resilience and supports habitat creation and supports the amazing wildlife that we have here.  And I think that has to be a good thing.  And I guess, you know, if we sort of look at things historically, and I know things in Scotland have been a bit different to the way they've been in England or Wales or elsewhere in the world, but land use and land ownership has always been in flux.  
**[0:32:50-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:32:50):**  And the fact that it's changing now isn't a new thing. It's just a current thing. And so the degree to which land remains in agricultural production or whether it's rewilded, as you say, is going to come down to customers.  It's going to come down to where that finance is. And if people want to make sure that land stays in agricultural production, then they need to make sure that they're buying products from that land.  And so if we're talking about a mosaic in the future, if we're trying to get as many outcomes as possible, multi outcome land use, then there is a degree to which that's going to be customer driven.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:33:26):**  But it is also going to depend on some of those frameworks that we've been talking about earlier and government interventions.  I think you're absolutely right. And I think that the geography is really important to understand here. In Scotland particularly, we have a massively steep gradient from pretty good agricultural land up to hill ground that is used in a very, very different way and can support a very, very different type of land use.  So what we have in Scotland is massive and massive range of different types of land. And we're kind of talking because we have to and we have a limited amount of time, but we're talking, you know, we're talking quite broadly about a piece of ground that actually looks very different in different places.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:34:01):**  And the reality is that rewilding, whatever you want to call it, from my perspective, ecological restoration through habitat creation, potentially funded by money that comes in through paying for ecosystem services, which is what I interact with, still only really works financially on small parts of the ground.  Commercial forestry and agriculture remain more lucrative in the majority of cases than any of these schemes. And as we talked about earlier, really where we're seeing this cropping up is on this kind of marginal hill ground where to a large extent, the dispersed activity and maybe quite dispersed sheep grazing or sporting interests.  So I think we'd be wrong to worry about the whole of Scotland being turned over to some kind of enormous rewilding scheme. I think we won't see that.  
**[0:34:50-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:34:50):**  Just finally, Charlie, there's one other issue that I wanted to ask you about that's come up in discussions around carbon farming. And this is just really simple. Are the public involved in decisions that are taken about land use changes?  Is there a process, for example, of seeking consent from surrounding citizens and communities as there would be if there was, I don't know, a wind farm being proposed?  We're getting a lot better at this. There is already a statutory process, quite a good statutory process for consultation and approval for particularly tree planting and woodland creation.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:35:23):**  And that involves a various staged consultation process that has to engage with both statutory consultees, but also the community. And something that I'm really pleased about is that because of the involvement of quite sophisticated partners in many of the schemes that we're involved in,  who have a very clear idea of what they want to achieve in terms of meeting their own ESG strategies, that they are taking that statutory process and then they are going further.  They are enhancing that and saying, actually, we would like to do more than this. We'd like to extend the consultation period. We'd like to engage in these different ways.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:35:57):**  We'd like to talk to these other people as well and make sure that we're incorporating as many different people as possible.  The reality is that this is usually over. It's not happening on primary crotch land. It's not happening on land that could be used for commercial forestry because those, as I said, remain most lucrative.  And the additionality requirements, again, as we talked about, mean that actually the result of these consultation processes, but also the woodland design and the other restraints that are part of designing a scheme, in most cases, we're developing environmentally sensitive schemes.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Carbon-farming-e1dg24r#t=0:36:29):**  Fantastic. That's been so interesting, Charlie, and it's such an important topic.

**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. This episode is a recording of a recent webinar looking back  at COP27 and progress that was made in relation to food systems and climate change.  Welcome everyone, thanks so much for joining us today. I'm Finn LoKostain, the founder  
**[0:00:20-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:00:20):**  of the Food and Global Security Network and producer of the Farmgate podcast. COP27 is  over, temperatures continue to rise and there's still no consensus about the role of land  use and agriculture. So did anything good emerge from Sharm El-Sheikh in terms of food  
**[0:00:37-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:00:37):**  system and climate change? Well, for this webinar, I'm joined by three experts who are  going to help us understand what happened at COP27, who were each at COP27. Patty Fong  is the programme director for climate and health and wellbeing for the Global Alliance  
**[0:00:52-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:00:52):**  for the Future of Food. Adele Jones is the executive director of the Sustainable Food  Trust and Chantelle Wei-Yin Clement is the deputy director of IPES Food. Welcome all,  thanks so much for being here. Chantelle, can I come to you first? An IPES Food news  
**[0:01:07-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:01:07):**  release over the weekend said that COP27 had agreed a farming deal. What is it? Thanks.  Firstly, thanks for bringing us all together for this discussion. I just said it in the  chat and I don't know how everyone else is feeling, but my mind is still reeling from  
**[0:01:19-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:01:19):**  the experience that is COP. So, looking forward to this opportunity to air out any grievances  together post COP. But I'd probably start by saying that farming deal somehow sounds  maybe too ambitious relative to what came out of COP, but this deal is referring to  
**[0:01:34-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:01:34):**  the Carnivia joint work on agriculture. And the Carnivia process was agreed on back in  2017 and it was supposed to be a four-year process dedicated to focusing on agriculture  under the UNFCCC. So this was really the UNFCCC finally recognising the potential of agriculture  
**[0:01:51-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:01:51):**  in tackling climate change. So at COP27, negotiators were meant to discuss what the next phase  of Carnivia would look like. And in light of the food price crisis, all the links that  we've been seeing between food system and climate over the past year, many of us really  
**[0:02:04-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:02:04):**  saw this as an opportunity, not only for the UNFCCC to tackle the role of agriculture on  climate change, but to finally take this much needed food systems approach on these questions  and to look at the role of the whole food system on climate change. I'm not going to  
**[0:02:18-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:02:18):**  recap the details. We know that food systems contribute one third of global greenhouse  gas emissions. So again, this was a real opportunity for us to look at how food systems aren't  just the root cause of a lot of climate change issues, but can be a big part of the solution.  
**[0:02:32-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:02:32):**  And just to recap the negotiations really quickly, what was frustrating is that these  negotiations on agriculture just really turned in circles this year, to the point that we  weren't even sure that we'd get a final text or a deal by the end of the two weeks of COP.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:02:44):**  And just to note that the final text for this phase of Carnivia was something that was supposed  to be agreed on last year at COP26, but that failed to get done. So it was pushed back  to this year. And again, to briefly recap, the process was really mired with difficulties  
**[0:02:58-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:02:58):**  from the get go. And we can maybe unpack that later. But you know, important solutions like  agroecology were taken out of the draft text over the summer in June. Some governments  in Sharm El Sheikh, like India, simply just didn't want to link mitigation to agriculture,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:03:11):**  which the draft text originally did. And I think a lot of our hopes that Carnivia might  expand to talk about food systems rather than just agriculture were completely dashed. So,  you know, many countries didn't want to include food systems because they didn't want to bring  
**[0:03:23-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:03:23):**  in something new. They didn't want to widen the scope beyond agriculture because they  thought it might slow down progress. So yes, it was historic that the UNFCCC process dealing  with agriculture was agreed on. But you know, many of us saw that this farm deal sort of  
**[0:03:37-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:03:37):**  had a weak conclusion to what could have been this really landmark decision to include food  systems approaches within the UNFCCC.  Jason Vale, Director of Global Development, UNFCCC So, what was agreed? You've talked  
**[0:03:46-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:03:46):**  about the things that were taken out of it, the things that I think probably many of us  listening today would kind of assume kind of ought to be in it. So, what was left at  the end?  
**[0:03:55-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:03:55):**  Claire Tompa I might turn to Paddy, actually, who is following  this process really closely. But just to briefly say, the conclusions were mostly that, you  know, we need to keep working on food and agriculture in the coming years. So, Carnivia  
**[0:04:04-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:04:04):**  was sort of established as an ongoing process. It wasn't just, you know, 2017 to 2022. So,  I think, you know, there was just a lot of recognition that we need to be dealing with  agriculture and food security. I think the text was mostly around adaptation and the  
**[0:04:17-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:04:17):**  need for continued conversation. But what the agenda will formally look like, my understanding  is that will be discussed in June and then at the upcoming COP. But I'll pass it to Paddy,  who knows the details.  
**[0:04:26-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:04:26):**  Paddy So, what was negotiated over the two weeks was actually not the details of Carnivia,  both sides and  v  
**[0:05:10-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:05:10):**  want to be optimistic. What it does, it sets a kind of a baseline for the negotiation of the kind of  actual detail of what the framework is going to include. So it just makes, you know, allies going  to keep pushing for food systems and agriculture in the coming year for it to be included and  
**[0:05:23-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:05:23):**  basically include it as a topic in the workshops and dialogues in the coming years. But because  there is no reference into the political statements, it makes it a lot harder to argue  for it. So if we had a reference to a political statement, it would have been easier to get  
**[0:05:35-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:05:35):**  agreement that that should be one of the topics. Thanks, both of you. I mean, you touched on this  a little bit, Chantal, in the first answer. Let's ask it again in a slightly more sort of pointed  fashion, because we talked about agroecology, for example, you know, being something that's shunted  
**[0:05:49-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:05:49):**  out. India not wanting to talk about mitigation. Does the COP process, in your view, tend to see  food systems simply as a problem to fix? Or does it actually see it also as an opportunity to  deliver a combination of mitigation and adaptation alongside food production? Sure. I mean,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:06:05):**  hypothetically, I would say it does do both things. You know, we as IPES Food have been repeatedly  saying that there is no 1.5 degree future without transforming away from industrial food systems  specifically. But again, I feel like this year, it was really just about putting food systems on  
**[0:06:20-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:06:20):**  the map at COP. You know, that was already a big win. And that's something that we did achieve.  You know, it should be acknowledged that it was unprecedented that the COP presidency dedicated  a formal somatic day to agriculture this year. It was on Saturday, November 12. And that was  
**[0:06:33-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:06:33):**  named Agriculture and Adaptation Day. So you know, that does show that they're not just seeing it as  a problem to fix, but something that can deliver on adaptation, you know, and mitigation at COP.  And just to say that beyond the formal negotiations, this was also the first time  
**[0:06:47-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:06:47):**  that a COP had four formal pavilions in the Blue Zone that were covering food issues. I think  someone said there was over 200 side events discussing food and farming. So, you know,  food systems were clearly on the radar, both, you know, as a contributor of climate change,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:07:00):**  but also as part of the solution. And the sticking point, of course, becomes, you know, what do those  solutions look like, and how ambitious our governments and the UNFCCC to consider the  real transformation that we need to see in food systems. And I think it's very much like the  
**[0:07:13-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:07:13):**  energy discussions happening at COP, in that acknowledging the problem is just step one,  but the more difficult step is to figure out how to actually address it. And I was joking at COP  that we're at COP 27. And we still haven't figured out what to do with energy. So if food is only on  
**[0:07:27-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:07:27):**  the map this year, is it going to take 27 more COPs to sort out, you know, ourselves for food?  And I think that there was some some disappointment here as well, because this was the Egypt COP,  this was the Africa COP, you know, where some of the effects, the worst effects of the food  
**[0:07:40-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:07:40):**  price crisis that we've been feeling this year were felt. You know, we're seeing the escalating  impacts of climate change on food and agriculture, especially in some regions of the world. So we  were really hoping that this would be the COP that would pick those things up in a meaningful way.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:07:52):**  But I think official mentions of food systems in any capacity were really few and far between,  and weren't particularly picked up in formal negotiations as much as we would have liked.  Jason Vale, Director of Global Development, The  
**[0:08:06-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:08:06):**  European Union and the European Union. Before we started, we were talking about the way in which  COP 28 is meant to be the COP of food, COP, we actually made some progress on food. And of course,  as you say, it's been 27 COPs and we still haven't sorted energy. So it could be a little  
**[0:08:16-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:08:16):**  while past COP 28, even with a fair wind. I'm just curious, you know, within the pavilions  that you were in, where you've got those sort of various events and various stands being represented  for different organisations, different interests in agriculture and food systems. Did you get the  
**[0:08:30-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:08:30):**  sense that there was an equal balance between the number of people there, lobbyists promoting  business as usual, and the number of people sort of promoting something, you know, closer to  agroecology and the sorts of things that we might be interested in? Or what was the balance?  
**[0:08:45-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:08:45):**  Jia-Jie Wang, Director of Global Development, The European Union and the European Union.  I think it's a range depending on who's on the panel and who organised it. It's really hard to  say. There was a good analysis on B. Smog that looked at, compared to last year, there were twice  
**[0:09:06-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:09:06):**  as many lobbyists from the agribusiness industry, which actually I count as progress, meaning that  they're present because they feel like, oh, we need to engage, something is moving in this area.  And, you know, there's also a high number of fossil fuels, obviously, that are also present,  
**[0:09:20-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:09:20):**  and they continue to be present. So, you know, I would, I hope it's not 27 more COPs, because,  you know, allies called for a food day a year ago, and unprecedented, we got a food day or agriculture  day, close enough, one year later. So that's, you know, for gender day, it took many years to get  
**[0:09:34-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:09:34):**  gender recognised. So I think countries, even though they're not willing to kind of give in  just now, they do see that it's coming, and the political pressure globally is building.  Can I just jump on that really quickly, just because I think Patty made a really good point  
**[0:09:48-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:09:48):**  that it depends on what event you were at, right, to see what the solutions being put forward sounded  like. And I think that is something that we need to work on moving forward, whether it's at COP28,  or just in general, is the fact that, you know, whether we're in the climate space or not, we're  
**[0:10:01-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:10:01):**  sort of talking in silos. So, you know, those who are pro agroecology will speak amongst themselves,  those who are pro perhaps like techno fixes and innovation will be speaking amongst themselves,  etc, etc. Small farmers had plenty of amazing events, but they were largely speaking to,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:10:15):**  you know, civil society and an advocacy crowd. So there are plenty of great solutions being put out.  It's just the fact that we're preaching to the converted in our various spaces. So you know,  when moving forward, how do we start having more difficult and complimentary conversations with  
**[0:10:28-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:10:28):**  each other? Sorry, one more thing. I know we're taking off track. But last year, we said we need  to diversify the voices talking about food. And there was acknowledgement was like, Oh,  where do we find them? So this year, we do see and I think partially because it was an African cop.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:10:42):**  So you did see more diversity, more than usual, there more generally, but also on food. So there  is an attempt, at least the you know, the sessions that I was in, or at least keeping an eye on at  least having a farmer or a local community member, at least on the panel to give a different  
**[0:10:57-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:10:57):**  perspective. So you didn't have the same global voices that were always there. So I think that  was also a difference and important pieces going forward to make sure that's not a one time thing  for Egypt for a couple of seconds, but it really kind of builds up over time.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:11:08):**  I guess that kind of brings us into the next question that I wanted to ask you, Paddy, which is,  you know, it's a frustration of mine that, you know, farm systems and global land use are hugely  variable, you know, farm size, what farm output is the climate that they're in, and yet international  
**[0:11:23-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:11:23):**  policy processes still seem to talk about food and agriculture, or at least appear to, in terms of a  sort of one size fits all approach or space. And certainly, you know, that comes across in the  mainstream media, cattle bad, plants good, no attempt at nuance in between. And so I wonder  
**[0:11:42-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:11:42):**  how we can deal with this complexity, how we can embed nuance in international frameworks,  particularly at a time when we're facing this looming crisis, and there is an urgency,  you know, to move forwards. So there is talk among some, you know, basically the three  
**[0:11:58-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:11:58):**  UN frameworks on climate, biodiversity and land degradation needs to be better connected under  the in the NARIA conventions. But that is a very technical process. And as you even within  ministries or companies, you have solidization of issues. But let me just zone in on on on a  
**[0:12:15-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:12:15):**  climate change, as kind of because, you know, they're all quite different international  frameworks. So, you know, for UNO Triple C, it started because we had a basically a total global  carbon budget, right, we have carbon budget stayed within 1.5 degrees. So the way you measure that is  
**[0:12:30-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:12:30):**  basically greenhouse gas emissions reduction. So this requires detailed accounting by country,  by sector, looking at specific sources, and therefore you look at wedges, that's what they  talk about it pathways. And the primary metric, which is driving the prioritization and action  
**[0:12:46-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:12:46):**  is around greenhouse gas emissions. But when you're talking about land use, it's more than  greenhouse gas emissions, right, you have other environmental health indicators, as well as on  livelihoods. And so all that comes in. But when the mandate for the framework is around greenhouse  
**[0:13:02-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:13:02):**  gas emissions, it just forces kind of a narrow view. So try to break out of that is hugely  challenging, not to mention that the way the food systems, at least industrialized food system is  structured is around maximizing yield. So you put those two get together, and then you get very  
**[0:13:17-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:13:17):**  simplified approaches, or solutions that are suggested, when in fact, it's, of course, much  more nuanced and complex. So you know, that kind of a good example is around methane emissions,  which is a huge deal right now, there's a global methane pledge, mostly around gas fossil fuel,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:13:33):**  but some aspect related to agriculture, but it still looks at the source. So the emissions per  cow, rather than looking at what are the kind of drivers on, for example, looking at industrial  livestock production, intensive livestock production and expansion. And if you try to  
**[0:13:49-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:13:49):**  bring in those broader indicators on biodiversity, and environmental health impacts, you get kind of  to a different set of issues or broader set of issues and may perhaps different set of solutions  of what needs to be tackled. And perhaps it may seem harder, of course, because it's systemic,  
**[0:14:03-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:14:03):**  but it's something that perhaps policymakers find it difficult because it makes them  have to coordinate across, you know, other government ministries as well.  Adele, I want to bring you in in just a second. But just one more question,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:14:15):**  Patsy, if I may, for you, and thanks so much for that. The principle of a loss and damage fund has  been won. And this is something that, you know, has been talked about quite a lot in the press.  It's been, you know, one of these things that's been seen as a win. But of course, there's no  
**[0:14:28-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:14:28):**  detail. And we've also heard that arguably the time spent winning it could have been much better  spent on getting existing mechanisms to work better. So the question really is, is the loss  and damage fund really a win? And where and how should the funding be directed?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:14:44):**  So yes, it is a win. This is the one thing where it was a priority for the Egyptian presidency,  and we must give it credit for that. Vulnerable countries, developed countries have been asking  for this for 30 years, and it's been blocked by industrialized countries, developed countries,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:14:58):**  all that time for fear of many cases of basically opening up to being sued for causing of damage.  You know, it's expected that from extreme weather events, it will cost over $200 billion annually.  And so you're already seeing droughts and hunger in the heart of Africa, flooding in West Africa  
**[0:15:13-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:15:13):**  and Pakistan. And this fund is meant to compensate countries that have already suffered from the  impacts of climate change. So it's different from adaptation, how you adapt, or mitigation. It's a  really very distinct fund. Acknowledgement is the first step. And it really signifies a mindset  
**[0:15:28-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:15:28):**  shift and acknowledgement that climate change is no longer about the future. It is here,  it's happening now. But you know, it's going to take a while to negotiate how big is the fund,  who's going to contribute to funds, and you know, how it will be paid out and all that. But just  
**[0:15:42-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:15:42):**  that kind of, you know, that political signal is really important at this point.  Paul And one of the things that the EU was saying in advance of COP was that, look, there are  existing mechanisms like the World Bank, why don't we just use the World Bank to deliver the kinds  
**[0:15:56-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:15:56):**  of funding that the loss and damage fund should do, and that, you know, now we've got the agreement to  the loss and damage fund, it could take, you know, a long time to set up the mechanisms to actually  achieve this. Do you think that there's any merit to that argument? I know the EU are backed away  
**[0:16:10-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:16:10):**  from it, but do you think there was merit in it in the first place?  Anna I am not an expert on World Bank. So it's hard for me to say now, you know, there's the  Green Climate Fund, there's adaptation facilities, these are all separate funds that are not going  
**[0:16:24-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:16:24):**  through World Bank or other existing institutions. So I think likely they'll want to see a separate  facility or fund set up that is managed, probably who gets to manage that and who gets to be on that  is very different because, you know, the World Bank, you know, who points the kind of head of  
**[0:16:38-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:16:38):**  the World Bank is the US. There are politics behind these organisations.  Paul Yeah, absolutely. Adele,  thanks very much. You've been sitting there very patiently. Let me come to you. Our farmers are on  
**[0:16:48-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:16:48):**  the front line in terms of addressing the climate and nature crisis. But mitigation has always seemed  fairly top line and remote, you know, when you're just working on the ground, while adaptation can  provide clear actions for all farmers individually on soil health, nutrient cycling, etc. I wonder if  
**[0:17:07-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:17:07):**  you think the time has come to really start emphasising the adaptation element alongside  mitigation, of course, in order to start demonstrating to the public and to policymakers  that farming is genuinely a part of the solution and not just part of the problem.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:17:21):**  Adele Yeah, I do. Firstly, just to say, thanks to  Patty and Chantal, I think your analysis is fascinating. And I think in a way we had very  different co-ops. So it's really useful to hear your perspectives on things. To your point,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:17:35):**  Finlow, I think it's great. Agriculture was included as a thematic day, as agriculture and  adaptation, as has been said. You know, I kind of was thinking about it more in the last 24 hours.  And I actually think both words aren't quite appropriate for agriculture. You know, mitigation,  
**[0:17:52-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:17:52):**  yes, of course, we need to do less harm to reduce the impact of climate change, we need to  emit less greenhouse gases, use less fossil fuels, do less pollution, etc. And of course,  we'd be kidding ourselves if we weren't also helping farmers adapt to a changing climate,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:18:08):**  be it different temperatures, droughts, flooding, we need to do both of those things. But actually,  what both of those words, if you take them very literally, miss out is the fact that agriculture  can be a huge part of the solution, you know, through drawing carbon back down into soil carbon,  
**[0:18:24-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:18:24):**  reintegrating trees back into farming systems, nature, of course, clean water, livelihoods.  There's so many different facets that agriculture can bring to this debate. And I actually don't,  I don't think either of those terms quite fit the bill. I think, I think, as you say,  
**[0:18:40-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:18:40):**  I think there's room in adaptation to think about some of these new mechanisms that we can hopefully  help farmers move to soil carbon sequestration. For example, we were hosted by an amazing group  whilst we were in Egypt called Sekem, S-E-K-E-M for anyone who wants to look it up. And they are a  
**[0:19:00-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:19:00):**  organic biodynamic farming group in Egypt, they have farms outside Cairo, about six hours south  of Cairo, their main farm is about one hour out of Cairo. And then they also have some farms up  near the Suez Canal. And it's all farmed in a biodynamic way using compost. And they just  
**[0:19:18-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:19:18):**  launched this soil carbon credit scheme at COP, which is hugely successful, they're able to  provide the farmers that are part of their sort of cooperative group with these, these new credit  payments. And it's allowing, it's allowing those farmers to take more steps to sequestering more,  
**[0:19:36-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:19:36):**  more carbon. And they're literally turning sand into, you know, beautiful soil where they're  growing herbs, fruits, vegetables, in an incredibly sustainable way. So I think I think there's,  there's things happening. It was it was super inspiring to see that in Egypt, where the COP was  
**[0:19:50-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:19:50):**  taking place. And Sekem have estimated that if all Egyptian farmers took up these practices of  composting and rotation to build soil carbon, they could offset 25% of Egypt's total greenhouse gas  emissions, which isn't, it's amazing. So we need to, we need to think about not just mitigation,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:20:09):**  not just adaptation, but how do we, how do we help farming become part of the solution?  And of course, if, if you're thinking about those systems, where they're starting to regreen an area  that was essentially desert, then there's a cooling impact associated with that as well. So  
**[0:20:25-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:20:25):**  it's not just the mitigation, it's the active cooling that's taking place, as well as then,  you know, the further adaptation. And I guess, you know, part of my question is around the way in  which sequestration is something that I think, by and large, farms are starting to become interested  
**[0:20:40-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:20:40):**  in, because there's a price tag associated with it. You know, you can plant some trees,  and you can get some funding in order to be able to deliver that in one way or another.  Whereas with soil health and nutrient cycling, these things that help with the adaptation  
**[0:20:52-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:20:52):**  element, actually, regardless of whether you're being paid for that, there is an incentive to do  it, it makes your business more resilient, it helps you to become more productive. And so,  if there are ways of, you know, regardless of people's attitude to climate change in and of  
**[0:21:07-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:21:07):**  itself, just helping farmers to understand that these processes are about making their farms work  better. Definitely. And I think we've got to introduce new financing schemes for farmers,  both from governments, but also the private sector to help de-risk that transition for farmers.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:21:24):**  Because it is, it is to a degree, for many farmers, a leap into the slight unknown,  particularly when you're reducing your dependence on external inputs like nitrogen,  which in a way is going to be playing out over the next six to eight months anyway,  
**[0:21:37-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:21:37):**  with the shortage of fertilizer as a result of the Ukraine crisis. And so it's a really risky  business for farmers right now. And we've got to help cushion that risk, and actually provide a  really positive business case to effectively make it a no brainer to transition and introduce,  
**[0:21:54-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:21:54):**  you know, not just kind of go down the soil carbon sequestration route, but also do things  like nutrient cycling, rotations, and those sorts of things as well. You said in the past that you  think the private sector and of course, you know, farming and agriculture, most of the food system,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:22:08):**  you know, actors are part of the private sector in one way or another, but that they're going to  be at the vanguard of change rather than governments, the governments will follow  rather than lead. Surely by definition, the private sector serves itself while governments  
**[0:22:22-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:22:22):**  are at least supposed to have society's best interests at heart. Why is it do you think the  governments are failing? And what is it that makes you think that private enterprise can succeed in  their stead? There's many reasons why governments are, I think, just moving too slowly. They're too  
**[0:22:38-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:22:38):**  cumbersome. There's so much bureaucracy surrounding everything. As Patty was saying, you have a  negotiation and stuff is constantly going in and out and in and out and in and out, and nothing  really changes at the end of it. And I think that's where private sector can play a role in  
**[0:22:52-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:22:52):**  being more nimble more quickly. During this COP, Patrick Holden and I were mainly with businesses,  primarily surrounding His Majesty's Sustainable Markets Initiative, which had a summit at the  event or outside of the main event, but in Sharm El Sheikh. It made me feel very encouraged that  
**[0:23:11-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:23:11):**  whilst we were hearing, you know, quite a lot of sort of exasperation coming from the blue zone  with the government negotiations going on, that actually the companies were stepping up and  saying, no, we can we can do this. And these are the things we're we're committed to doing by this  
**[0:23:24-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:23:24):**  time next year. And of course, these commitments are just words until they actually happen. And  we see our role as a sort of little NGO amongst these giant businesses to hold their feet to the  fire, basically, and make sure they do follow up on the things that they have promised to.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:23:41):**  But I think private sector can move more quickly. And you have to remember that most of these large  companies are bigger than some of the countries that are represented. So I was talking to Mars,  for example, the land impact is bigger than the country of Panama. So you know, it's it's really,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:23:58):**  we're talking country sized companies here. And so they should really, you know, be involved in  this process. And I feel optimistic about what they can do, but we really have to hold them to  account. And if we think of a company like Mars, then you know, that's, it's not just a few tweaks  
**[0:24:14-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:24:14):**  around the edges, is it? It's understanding that it's actually, it's not just about their farmers  having to change, but it's about their whole approach to business that will have to change  ultimately. You know, the way that they get the ingredients that they're using, the way that they  
**[0:24:28-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:24:28):**  operate within the marketplace, I mean, all kinds of different things that are going to have to  change in terms of their business model. Do you think they get that? Because I know the report  that you mentioned, I think, is the Terracotta report on SMIs. And to be honest, it's quite  
**[0:24:41-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:24:41):**  hard to find on Google. So if you can give us the proper name of it, I'd appreciate that, Adele,  because people can look at it. It's a fantastic report. It really does a great job of encapsulating  the things that we're talking about here. But do you think that the signatories to that report,  
**[0:24:56-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:24:56):**  like Mars, really genuinely get that it's such a big change, and are genuinely committed to it?  I think that let's say they're on a journey to getting it. I think there's some actually  very sort of enlightened CEOs and top sort of senior team within these companies, who really  
**[0:25:14-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:25:14):**  are starting to understand the complexity of the challenge we face. And that, as you say,  it's not just about tweaking around the edges, it's actually sort of reform of supply chains and  the way they do business. So it's a huge challenge. And of course, you've got to, you know, it's got  
**[0:25:31-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:25:31):**  to be an orderly transition, as is the case with energy as well. I mean, real credit to the King  in bringing all these different companies together through the Sustainable Markets Initiative,  because what it does is it puts them all in a room together, they're all facing very similar  
**[0:25:47-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:25:47):**  challenges from their own different industries that they all represent. And I think it allows  for that kind of cross sector collaboration, new ideas sparking up that actually they probably  wouldn't, they wouldn't have if they weren't, you know, sitting in a room together at these, these  
**[0:26:01-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:26:01):**  very nice receptions with the King. So it's, it's really interesting to watch that dynamic play out.  And of course, now the challenge is, okay, well, if the CEO gets it, and the people in their top  team get it, how do you make sure that filters through the rest of the company, which is a really  
**[0:26:16-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:26:16):**  big challenge, and of course, shareholders as well, is another really big challenge.  Because often it can feel like you're sort of talking to people who are in middle management  level. And they, they struggle to make the change in both directions. And that that change really  
**[0:26:29-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:26:29):**  has got to come from the top. Patty, land use change needs to be part of the solution  everywhere. But for many farmers, agroecological transition is inherently risky. We've touched on  this a little bit already. It's a big change to the status quo for them. And certainly in our  
**[0:26:46-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:26:46):**  work, we've often found that transformation on individual farms has been driven by a personal  or financial crisis and need to step off that expensive and often exhausting production  treadmill. Now, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, your organisation that you represent,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:27:00):**  look closely at the role of nationally determined contributions, the NDCs that are part of the  COP process in supporting transition, knowledge exchange and market reform. And I just wonder if  you've summarised what you discovered? Well, this links back to my previous comment about  
**[0:27:15-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:27:15):**  the challenge of breaking out of kind of very narrowed focus on greenhouse gas emissions. So,  as a way to kind of introduce, well, what does it mean to apply food systems thinking to the NDCs,  which essentially are climate action plans by countries as to indicate their contribution to  
**[0:27:35-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:27:35):**  reaching the Paris Agreement, which is to get to globally to below one and a half degrees.  So, we developed the framework, which looked at how you would integrate this kind of thinking,  and it's more than just a contest, more than just saying you have to do agroecology and you have to  
**[0:27:47-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:27:47):**  do food loss and waste and you have to do shift diets and consumption patterns. It's also looking  at governance processes, which are just as important. So, who was engaged? Were health  stakeholders engaged? Were farmers, older farmers, youth, women, were they engaged? How were they  
**[0:28:02-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:28:02):**  engaged? How were their comments taken to count? And then what types of measures or programmes  did that lead to from that consultation process? Then how is that financed? How's it being  implemented? Right. So, one of the big issues and we applied this framework, we developed it first,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:28:18):**  we applied it to 14 countries. So, foreign Africa, we put it to the UK plus three countries and  within the EU, US, Canada, Colombia, China, Vanuatu and Bangladesh. So, we want to have  a diversity of perspectives. And we knew going in that we were going to find the best example,  
**[0:28:35-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:28:35):**  because the idea of thinking about food systems is very new in the climate agenda. You see it now  more in words, but actually applying it in practice is still very challenging. And so,  we found is that, you know, there are some bright spots. For example, Colombia really kind of did  
**[0:28:51-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:28:51):**  an extensive consultation engagement process, which led to a lot of very diverse proposals.  And, you know, the kind of takeaways is if you're not engaging the right people, one, you might not  get the solutions you're looking for with climate co-benefits and two, you're not going to get the  
**[0:29:04-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:29:04):**  ownership for implementation. We also published a follow-up analysis, which looked at, well,  in the NDCs, how much our country is asking for, for their food systems related measures,  and how much is actually being allocated overall for food systems from climate, from public sector  
**[0:29:20-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:29:20):**  climate finance. What we found that, you know, Chantal mentioned earlier that one third of  global greenhouse gas emissions comes from food systems, well, only 3% of climate finance goes to  to food systems. So, there's a huge discrepancy in the NDCs itself. We looked at the 167 that  
**[0:29:35-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:29:35):**  were submitted, and of those, look at the developing countries. So, basically the ones  who usually are recipients of climate finance, only 14 billion was named in total for food systems  versus 64 billion for clean energy and clean transport. So, just even the kind of the thinking  
**[0:29:51-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:29:51):**  about, first of all, if you don't prioritize food systems and actually be very concrete about what  you want to do, and then cost it out as something that needs funding, you're not going to get  funding or financing from governments. And we also looked at, well, actually, besides climate  
**[0:30:06-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:30:06):**  finance, there's a much bigger pot of public sector financing going towards food systems.  And that's in the form of subsidies for agricultural production. So, over 600 billion a  year goes towards agricultural production, and 86% actually has no guardrails for climate, health,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:30:22):**  or environment, which means there's no conditionality, whether you can use pesticides,  whether you can use how much fertilizer, what types of chemicals. And so, it just goes straight  out there, and it's not at all aligned with our climate objectives. So, even a first step beyond  
**[0:30:36-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:30:36):**  climate is just thinking through the policy from what's underpinning the current global  industrialized food system. If we don't start to shift and repurpose and redirect it towards  farming that is more nature-friendly, like agroecology, that is more equitable, then we're  
**[0:30:51-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:30:51):**  not going to see the type of changes. And just kind of feeding back on what Adele was saying,  of course, there are progressive companies that are first movers, and we need them. But then there  is still kind of the rest of the private sector that unless they see writing on the wall, they  
**[0:31:05-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:31:05):**  see that they're going to have stranded assets, they see government regulation coming down the  line at some point, they're not going to shift as well. So, we need to show we need progressive  companies to show that it is doable, it's possible, but we also need government regulation as well to  
**[0:31:19-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:31:19):**  shift the rest of the market. Thank you so much, Patty. There's so much to think about in that.  One of my questions, I suppose, around it is where the money most needs to be targeted. If  we're talking about energy, then there's a degree to which lots of investment in new technology and  
**[0:31:35-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:31:35):**  ways of deploying that new technology is really helpful to help that sort of R&D at the same time  as then potentially supporting and subsidizing the installation of essentially a new wind farm  or whatever else it happens to be in the future. With land, where does that money need to go,  
**[0:31:52-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:31:52):**  do you think? Is it about just simply funding farmers to do something differently? Is it about  knowledge exchange or does technology play a role in that as well? I think it needs to be context  specific. And, you know, from our perspective, it's not just we need more finance for food systems,  
**[0:32:09-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:32:09):**  but it's how that finance is structured and who gets to be at the table in discussing how to  structure it and what it funds. And right now, it's usually kind of held, I mean, a lot of the  climate finance, it goes from these kind of funds like green climate funds or international fund  
**[0:32:24-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:32:24):**  for agricultural development, it goes to governments. So, and then who are the governments  consulting? Who's engaged in those processes? Oftentimes, they're not engaging enough or the  right people. So, it gets stuck there. So, there's a lot. And so, and just on kind of innovation,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:32:38):**  yes, but it's not just technological innovation, right? It's not just peer-to-peer learning. So,  there's a lot of great examples of different ways we can think about innovation, whether it's not,  it's also social innovation, as well as, you know, like the initiative that Adele brought up second,  
**[0:32:52-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:32:52):**  there are a lot of these great community-led initiatives, which could be funded and scaled  up in a way. And I say scale in a broad sense, like each one is quite specific to their context.  But there are ways in which, you know, in the broadest scale, like the type of principles-based,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:33:09):**  values-based, the way that they are set up, that leads to their success, that type of thinking  requires also different way of thinking from governments, as well as from the private sector.  Jason Vale Thank you. Chantal, Christiana Figueres,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:33:20):**  who was the power behind the Paris Agreement, I know that she was, recently lamented that 30  years or so ago, the UN decided to split action on nature into the three separate mechanisms that we  mentioned earlier. So, climate, biological diversity and desertification. She always  
**[0:33:36-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:33:36):**  talked about that being, you know, one of the biggest mistakes that was made by the UN.  Now, food systems, more than anything else, connect these processes back again. So,  looking ahead to COP15 on biological diversity, and back towards the Food Systems Summit last year,  
**[0:33:51-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:33:51):**  are there ways in which this climate COP did anything to contribute to a more joined-up  approach to nature regeneration? Chantal Figueres Yeah, I think that's a really good question,  and a really good point. And I certainly saw more discussion this year than in previous years,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:34:04):**  making the link between climate and biodiversity specifically. I think desertification often is  the forgotten COP. And that's the one that tends to be left out. But I saw a lot of discussion  happening around climate and biodiversity, especially as it related to food systems,  
**[0:34:18-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:34:18):**  which was very heartening, I think. There is always the Rio Conventions Pavilion that's present  at the COP that always tries to make the link between these three conversations. But again,  I think so far, this has all been acknowledged in rhetoric, mostly, and not necessarily through any  
**[0:34:33-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:34:33):**  kind of concrete action. You know, that being said, I think there was an interesting initiative,  the ICANN initiative, I think it's the Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition, that links not  the two issues, or not the issues you mentioned, but that links nutrition and climate action.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:34:46):**  And so for me, these are the kinds of initiatives that are starting to come out in the climate space,  which are exciting to me, because they are starting to make the link between climate and  everything else that climate touches on, and also the link, as we said, between food systems and  
**[0:34:59-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:34:59):**  everything else that touches on. So you know, this, that specific initiative was launched by  the COP presidency and the WHO, if I'm not mistaken. I think the FAO has some involvement,  but I'm not quite sure. But you know, again, again, it's showing how these crucial issues  
**[0:35:12-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:35:12):**  can be linked in these spaces, if we think about them in a more comprehensive way.  And again, I'm repeating things here, but food systems are really the linchpin for a lot of that,  because, you know, what else can tackle hunger and malnutrition, climate, biodiversity,  
**[0:35:25-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:35:25):**  revitalization of natural resources, then food systems. So you know, if COP did anything to,  in that direction, I think it would be through some of these initiatives and pledges that we saw,  not necessarily in the in the formal spaces, but that were made around them. And I would say that  
**[0:35:39-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:35:39):**  if there was anything that did more concretely link biodiversity, climate and desertification,  it was actually a lot of the farmer representation that was at COP. And you know, a lot of these  voices were a bit marginalized at within the negotiation. But we saw a lot of action from  
**[0:35:55-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:35:55):**  the part of AFSA, the African Food Sovereignty Alliance, who really pushed for, you know,  these more diverse agro ecological food systems, and showed, you know, very concretely through  their events, how farming systems can be the means to create resilient livelihoods, biodiversity and  
**[0:36:10-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:36:10):**  soil restoration, just tackling all these issues at the same time. And we saw similar messages  from, I think, other farmer constituencies to indigenous peoples constituencies. And again,  many of these voices that tend to be marginalized, they're the ones who are carrying these truly  
**[0:36:23-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:36:23):**  comprehensive and holistic solutions, but are often again, left out of debate. So it's a bit  frustrating, because those links are being made, they're just not being, what's the word in English,  kind of valorized or, you know, valued as they should be.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:36:34):**  It makes me think as well, you know, about the difficulty around carbon tunnel vision,  about the way in which if we focus too hard in on greenhouse gas reduction, then we miss  opportunities, or we subvert opportunities that we could be using to try and get nature to function  
**[0:36:50-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:36:50):**  better. You know, we can sometimes cut off our nose to spite our face, and we may need to accept  that there's a slightly less optimal greenhouse gas outcome in one aspect, but it helps to deliver  these other aspects. And so that joining back up of this conversation is so critically important.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:37:06):**  Patti, Chantelle touched on the whole health and nutrition thing, but could you go into it in a  bit more detail? The health and nutrition have increasingly been discussed alongside  climate change and nature. And I wonder to what extent you think a health lens can help people  
**[0:37:19-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:37:19):**  to change the narrative in favor of greater land and dietary diversity?  Absolutely. Well, you know, my title is climate and health. So, of course, I naturally see the  change between the two. You know, actually, my background, I come from more energy, and I've seen  
**[0:37:34-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:37:34):**  the health sector come in and they weigh in very heavily on health angles to climate change,  mostly focused today on energy, the energy transition, fossil fuel phase out, air pollution.  But they increasingly have a voice around food and nutrition as well. So, you know, we actually  
**[0:37:50-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:37:50):**  did a survey through with kind of global health networks and majority found that, yes, sustainable  and healthy diets are really important in the context of climate change. And so that's one  aspect of where health and food come together. It's diets, it's food insecurity, hunger,  
**[0:38:06-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:38:06):**  micronutrient deficiencies. It's also around zoonosis and antimicrobial diseases. For example,  livestock encroaching on forests or excessive use of antibiotics. It's also around unsafe and  contaminated foods. So, you know, viruses and bacteria are chemical residues from pesticides.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:38:23):**  It's environmental contamination and degradation. So fertilizer runoff, for example, or excess manure  or endocrine disrupting chemicals or growth hormones in livestock. And finally, you have  worker safety issues. So whether it's farmers, fishers, it's other workers in the food chain,  
**[0:38:39-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:38:39):**  chemical exposure, stress, injuries, I mean, all these aspects really touch on. And so for those  in the climate space, maybe they only see right now diets and food security as the main angle.  But I think if we bring in these other aspects for governments and for stakeholders, it makes  
**[0:38:55-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:38:55):**  a stronger near-term case for action than if you just focus on greenhouse gas emissions  specifically. And just to kind of, you know, one more comment because Adele was mentioning kind of  the new commitments by major companies to support regenerative agriculture and especially food  
**[0:39:13-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:39:13):**  companies. One thing we haven't heard, so I applaud that because I think that's important,  looking at the supply chain and where they're sourcing. But many of these companies are also,  you know, their profits come from processing. And what we haven't talked about in the climate  
**[0:39:25-0:39:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:39:25):**  discussion is healthy diets. So there is still, you know, you have huge health issues from  consumption of ultra-processed foods, high sugars, high fats. And so if we're not addressing health  impacts from food as part of the shift in kind of diets and consumption patterns, then we're also  
**[0:39:45-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:39:45):**  not addressing climate change fully and holistically. So that's something that as we  kind of move more into this what to how, I think we need to think carefully about what this means  and make sure that we don't create unintended consequences for human health. Adele, if not a  
**[0:40:00-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:40:00):**  consensus, then there's certainly a growing global movement towards an agroecological transition.  But there's also a great deal of fear, particularly from governments, that agroecology  just can't feed the world and that the level of disruption in transitioning from business as usual  
**[0:40:16-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:40:16):**  to agroecology is just too big to manage. And I wonder if what you think about that and whether  this COP did anything to start changing that perception, particularly amongst leaders in richer  nations? Yeah, it's a really big argument that's still going on. And we were talking at the  
**[0:40:34-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:40:34):**  beginning about the degree of consensus, I suppose, around what the future of food and  farming looks like. And there is still a lot of confusion and a lot of differing views. For  example, I think the fertilizer companies, although they are making commitments to reduce  
**[0:40:51-0:41:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:40:51):**  how much fertilizer they're generally selling to farmers, they're also seeing, for example,  Africa is not as a market they haven't yet broken into. And then, of course, you get the people  arguing that, well, if we're going to feed 10 billion people, then we need these inputs to  
**[0:41:04-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:41:04):**  produce more food in parts of the world like Africa, which we would very much disagree with  for multiple reasons, which we don't have time to go into necessarily. I think we absolutely  can feed the world's population with agroecological regenerative farming techniques.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:41:21):**  Some things will just need to change, not least what we eat, we'll need to eat a different sort  of variety of foods, more sort of seasonal based on the landscape around us. As a global  population, we'll need to reduce meat consumption, but recognizing there are livestock that are  
**[0:41:37-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:41:37):**  incredibly important as part of the climate solution. So we need to stop eating, ideally,  intensive pork and poultry and, of course, dairy and beef from intensive systems, but really make  sure when we do eat meat that it's part of the right type of farming systems. And waste is the  
**[0:41:55-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:41:55):**  other big issue as well. We're wasting between a third and a half of all the food we produce and  eat. So if you kind of think about those calories, the whole argument is just flawed at the moment.  So we really need to do more research. We did our Feeding Britain from the ground up report,  
**[0:42:10-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:42:10):**  which found we could maintain our food security in the UK if we transitioned to fully regenerative  agroecological farming systems. It's just that the nature of our plates would need to look a little  bit different. And I think the same is true across the world. We just need to do that research to  
**[0:42:26-0:42:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:42:26):**  understand how we can align our diets with the productive capacity of farms around us, basically.  Stop wasting so much, eat a greater diversity of whole foods rather than fermented foods,  which I can see coming up quite a lot in the chat. Yeah. And we'll come to that in just a moment.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:42:45):**  And there are a couple of questions here that I'm going to go to from the audience now, if that's  all right. And I was going to ask this question, but I'm not now, which is how much in percentage  terms of farmland would we lose if we follow the actual path of two degrees Celsius? And I think,  
**[0:43:01-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:43:01):**  my immediate answer to that is it's complicated and very difficult to answer in simple terms. But  I think that Adele, your answer to the last question, to an extent, dealt with that. It's  about change and adaptation of diets as much as it is about adaptation of land use. The question  
**[0:43:19-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:43:19):**  that I wonder if speakers could have a bit of a go at, I mean, reboot food has been mentioned. I  don't want to give too much time and credence to them because they're just a new campaign and who  knows how successful they will be. But the concept of the technologies and precision fermentation,  
**[0:43:37-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:43:37):**  which has been given such a kind of a big voice, particularly recently by people like George  Monbiot, where there's these suggestions that livestock should just be eradicated from the  countryside and we should all move to precision fermentation instead at one extreme. And then,  
**[0:43:52-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:43:52):**  at the other end, there could just be a little bit of an inclusion of some of these things to  replace some of the proteins and other nutrition that people need. So, the question really is,  what role do you see for technology in terms of replacing some of the basic land use that we have,  
**[0:44:07-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:44:07):**  I suppose? Anybody want to start on that? Otherwise, I'll pick on somebody. Chantelle.  I'm happy to give it a go first. And I think I'm going to look big picture here rather than  give a precise answer. But we've overused this imagery. But we keep saying that food systems  
**[0:44:19-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:44:19):**  are at a crossroads. And I think that can't be overstated. Because we have one path leading us  down what I'll call business as usual, with kind of systems being tweaked around the edges of the  edges, which we've said already. And where we try to think of how we can improve the practices that  
**[0:44:34-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:44:34):**  we have today just enough to get us to somewhere better. My issue with those solutions, and I'll  put a lot of the tech solutions that are being put out under this kind of paradigm, is that they're  still operating under what's inherently this kind of industrial logic for our food systems, based on  
**[0:44:49-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:44:49):**  specialization, commodification, capitalism, I've said the big C word, and things like that. But  then we have this other pathway, as I mentioned, that is being put forward by smallholder farmers,  by indigenous communities, by local communities around the world, that are really based on just  
**[0:45:04-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:45:04):**  rethinking our food systems completely, you know, based on diversification on land sharing, rather  than land sparing on justice, food sovereignty, region, agroecology, whatever you want to call it.  And under these approaches, you know, I think most of the world right now, most smallholder farmers  
**[0:45:18-0:45:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:45:18):**  are trying something that looks like this model, you know, they just need the support to be able  to do it. So, you know, these solutions, these tech solutions may be some part of that first  kind of pathway that I've described. But if we really want to think, you know,  
**[0:45:31-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:45:31):**  ambitiously in a transformative way, we need to consider the second pathway. And for me,  a lot of those technologies just, it's not that they're irrelevant, but they don't have as much  of a place in that second scenario, because we are trying to do things in a different way that  
**[0:45:44-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:45:44):**  we haven't really tried before. And for me, that's much more exciting. And that's where we should be  putting our energy. Beautifully put. Thank you, Chantelle. Anybody else got anything to add there?  I think you summed it up perfectly Chantelle. I think it's I see a little bit like vertical  
**[0:45:58-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:45:58):**  farming, as you say, it's potentially got an important place. But to me, it's always going to  operate in that sort of niche of filling a gap in places where you potentially can't produce healthy,  nutritious food on the land. And so not totally against the idea in principle, but I think wiping  
**[0:46:15-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:46:15):**  farming off the face of the planet effectively, it's just actually really irresponsible and quite  So, I would put it in the sort of niche of technology that can form a small part of the solution in certain scenarios.  There's one final question that I want to go to, and perhaps, Patti, I can come to you first on this.  
**[0:46:30-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:46:30):**  And the question is around the role of consumer education. And I guess the question really is about where change should come from in the marketplace,  whether it should be bottom up, whether it should be about farmers, for example, saying, well, our land can grow this and therefore we're going to supply this.  And that's the way the market changes, or whether that pressure should be coming from the consumer end and how consumers can be mobilised to put that pressure into place.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:47:01):**  I was on a panel discussion hosted by Consumers International with a kind of an Oxford style debate where I had to play the role of saying that just more information for consumers wasn't enough.  So, yes, there is a role for information out there for consumers, especially by companies.  But I also believe that information and access to information is asymmetrical in terms of what actually gets disclosed,  
**[0:47:26-0:47:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:47:26):**  what are the metrics used for disclosing it, and just the amount of money that is spent on marketing and control of that information leaves consumers in a position where they don't know what to believe,  they don't know what's true, they actually don't even understand what's on their labels.  And so, you need the role of government to regulate that information and regulate what can be disclosed in order to create kind of a level playing field and to help consumers be able to access.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:47:55):**  On the other hand, you do need consumers because they need to feel like it's not just government telling them what to do, they need to feel empowered and wind to see the change and that it's good for not only for the planet, it's good for them, their families.  So it is both that needs to happen in tandem. Of course, that is our challenge, but it can't be all just on consumer behaviour alone.  It's really got to be pressure points from all sides. I think citizens are an incredibly powerful force.  
**[0:48:19-0:48:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:48:19):**  They put the heat on companies when they're demanding different things in the supermarket, let's say, and they also vote for different governments based on their policies.  So I do think citizens hold the key to a lot of this change.  But we also need to preempt some of what they're wanting. Companies need to lead the way.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:48:40):**  And I think governments need to be more bold.  So I think it's really got to be kind of all sides pushing together and no one relying on another group to be a first mover.  I heard something really interesting about companies the other day. All companies want to be the first at being second.  
**[0:48:55-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:48:55):**  And I think that's so true. And I think it's the same with governments as well.  It's like they all want to do something and they want to lead the way, but they actually don't want to be the first one.  And I think we need to stop. We need to stop with that. We're in a crisis and just everyone might play their part, whether you're a first mover or not.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/COP27-and-food-systems---what-happened-e1re4b2#t=0:49:10):**  Fantastic. That's a great place to end. So thanks so much.

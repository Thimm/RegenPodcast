**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, the Regenerative Agriculture podcast. I'm Finnlow Costane.  From the start, Farmgate has championed regenerative food systems as a solution to many of the  social, economic and environmental challenges we face. Because the regenerative movement  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:00:20):**  is fairly new, even though some of the knowledge and techniques have been around for generations,  there are many ideas about what regen actually means. So for us at Farmgate, this is our  working definition.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:00:31):**  Regenerative food systems are holistic and inclusive. They strengthen the health and  vitality of all ecosystem components, communities, people, animals, plants and microbes. Regenerative  food production focuses on regeneration of the land, coast and sea. It increases biodiversity,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:00:49):**  enriches soils, improves watersheds and water quality and enhances ecosystem services such  as carbon sequestration, food productivity, nutrient cycling and climate resilience. This  programme is dedicated to your questions about regen agriculture, questions that we've received  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:01:06):**  from farmers about how to manage regenerative farming systems, which I'll be putting to  two experts. For example, how do you get started? Is it normal to see so many thistles? Which  breeds do best in what systems and what role can regen play in managing endemic disease?  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:01:22):**  Well, hopefully this programme is the first of a series of question times that we're going  to run every six weeks or so. And today I'm joined by Caroline Grindrod and Alex Tomlinson  from the Regenerative Agriculture Consultancy, Roots of Nature. Alex and Caroline also set  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:01:37):**  up and moderate the Primal Web Regen Agriculture Online Forum, which I can highly recommend.  Hello both. We have 10 anonymised questions and limited time available. So let's get started.  Number one, this is my first year on this farm. I grazed this section about six weeks  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:01:54):**  ago. I thought I'd left it in optimum condition for healthy regrowth. The thistles have grown  densely in the whole of the paddock. Is this normal? And I'm going to come to Caroline  first. Thanks, Finn, for that great introduction. And yes, the thistles question is one that  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:02:09):**  we get a lot actually. All these things are quite difficult to cover really quickly, but  I'll do my best. The thistle problem, if you like, is really coming back to understanding  ecological succession. And that's one of the real foundations of our work and any agro-ecological  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:02:26):**  thinking and doing. So really, succession is all about starting on bare rock, what does  nature do with it, then builds in complexity and we gradually increase and expand that  complexity so that you get diverse swards in the grassland and then eventually it will  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:02:41):**  be moving on into woodland, wood pasture and then woodland. So that's the process of ecological  succession is that building of complexity. And what happens above ground generally happens  below ground. So when you see lots of diversity on the top and the fields, then that's also  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:02:56):**  being represented by the complexity of the underground soil food web. So in a very low  successional state, you'll get a lot of bacteria, but very few predators eating the bacteria  and very little fungi. And then gradually as you shift succession towards the woodland  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:03:10):**  end, then you'll get much more fungi and many predators, but very few bacteria. So often  in our farming systems, we're doing the opposite of advancing succession, which is what nature  wants to do. We're knocking it back by using ploughing and chemicals and overgrazing. So  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:03:24):**  we're constantly reducing the complexity of the soil food web back to predominantly to  bacteria. And when we get those soils that are predominantly bacteria, we end up having  these low successional species. So you tend to get fewer varieties, but more booms and  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:03:37):**  busts in population at that low successional end. So that's exactly what we're happening  when we're seeing thistles appear. It's that you've got very low successional state in  your soil, a lot of bacteria. And when that gets stimulated by grazing or trampling, then  
**[0:03:51-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:03:51):**  they release nitrates. And then you get a lot of these nitrate weeds that are also sort  of the low successional ones. And unfortunately, they also seem to be, you know, the very prolific  cedars and they're also quite generalist species that they can do in a lot of different environments.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:04:02):**  So once you've got that problem, it's a little bit harder to get rid of it. But ultimately  what we're dealing with is an indication that you've got a low successional soil. So what  we tend to recommend doing about that, if and it depends on what you're trying to manage  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:04:13):**  for and why, which is every question will come back to that. But if we're trying to  avoid too many thistles, we don't want too much of anything, then we want to advance  succession beyond what the condition that suits them. So that's their niche is low successional  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:04:26):**  state. So we want to get more complex soils, which means increasing diversity, using plant  grazing to improve the soil food web, and then gradually that will become a non-problem.  And we've seen pretty quick results on that actually, in even the first season that they're  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:04:40):**  reducing quite dramatically.  And when you say increasing diversity, do you mean actually physically putting more  seeds down or allowing it to happen naturally?  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:04:47):**  My preference is always to try and see what, you know, facilitate the natural seedbed coming  back. Sometimes that will be much harder, depending on how poorly, you know, the state  of the soil is in the first place. But I always think it's worth trying to see what will come  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:04:59):**  up yourself. So yeah, managing to a point where it allows that increase in diversity,  and that means long recovery periods, so that you're allowing everything to set seed and  allowing things to come up. So too big a scope for this question. But you know, ultimately,  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:05:11):**  what we're trying to do is move beyond that low successional state. So stop doing the  things that are creating it, i.e. spraying them would just then keep knocking that succession  backwards, topping them would compact the soils and make it worse, you know, so we can  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:05:22):**  maybe go in and actually just try to prevent them seeding as an immediate way of treating  the problem to hold it back a little bit. But ultimately, we've got to go back to what's  the root cause and that's the low successional state of the soil. So we want to try and advance  
**[0:05:34-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:05:34):**  that.  Thanks for that, Caroline. I'm just wondering as well, just about the role that these roots  have in breaking up the soil and actually trying to, you know, what you can see above  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:05:43):**  ground, you said that you can often see that below ground, but thistles have good, strong,  deep roots. And so they're getting down deeper, presumably, than some of the grasses and breaking  up the soil and helping with with that soil recovery as well.  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:05:56):**  Absolutely. So those low successional species are exactly that. They're like the drilling  team coming in to break up and aerate your soil. So again, docks do the same thing. And  it depends on what, you know, on the upland environments, other species would come in  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:06:07):**  and do it instead. But you know, if you're in a position where there's thistle seed available,  that's what's going to come in. And exactly, it's preparing the soil for the next set of  community dynamics. So ultimately, it's just advancing and then they'll just disappear.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:06:19):**  And actually, all the projects I've worked on that have had this problem, it's really  so quite quickly, they're reducing within the first year, the second year. And again,  as you said, everything's different everywhere you go. It's totally unique soil geology underneath  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:06:32):**  that that almost brings us perfectly to the second question, actually, which is number  two, what is the optimal recovery period for a paddock? And I think Caroline, you wanted  to come in on that first?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:06:42):**  Yeah, happy to and again, it's back to this idea of there is no optimal because it's really  about everything in regenerative and holistic management is about what are you trying to  manage for and why. So it's going to depend on that you can use regenerative techniques  
**[0:06:55-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:06:55):**  and holistic management to manage for everything from a dairy herd to a rewilding project.  So really, what are you trying to achieve? And that's the first part of all of our training  is really clarifying what you want to do and why and getting to the truly holistic idea  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:07:08):**  of is it what you want to do with people? Is it what is it good for the environment?  And is it making you money? Ultimately, once you've decided what you're trying to manage  for, you can then it's like being in a relationship with your land, it's not prescriptive at all  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:07:20):**  regenerative agriculture, and we have to very much carefully avoid trying to fall into that  trap. I think I would say, okay, well, it's about understanding what you say what you're  trying to aim for. And then you sort of observe your environment, try and take some leads  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:07:33):**  from things, areas like verges and things that may have been arrested for a while, see  what's happened there, start to get an understanding of what happens under certain management,  and then play around with it. So try it is try a six, you know, seven week recovery,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:07:45):**  see what happens. And we really ultimately are trying to look for if we're if we're looking  at a grassland management for say, brief production, we're trying to look at getting a really good  mix of making sure that things are setting seed. So we don't want to I mean, again, depending  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:07:57):**  on how focused on production you are, I would be sort of trying to avoid if we're trying  to increase diversity, we need things to go to seed because they need to be produced.  So ultimately, you're always going to want ideally end up with a diverse ward, which  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:08:09):**  means that they're always all the different species are going to be at different stages  at different times of the year. So trying to get to one particular leaf stage or stage  of reproduction is pointless, really, when you're working with this diverse sword, you're  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:08:21):**  going to get lots of different things happening. And it's all going to be different at different  parts of the year. So in spring, certain species will be going to seed, you know, your sweet  vernal grass will be going to seed really early, but then other things will be coming  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:08:31):**  through and be in a vegetative state. So you want a really nice mix of all the functional  groups, you want to make sure that all of them are having the chance to set seed and  reproduce and you want to get to the point where if you're really concerned about production  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:08:42):**  that you're not allowing it to go to rank and dry and senesce too much, too many species  senesce all at the same time. So you know, again, trampling and trying to find that sweet  spot of when to come back and regraise is going to be very specific to your own operation.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:08:56):**  So play around, realise that every part of the year will have a different recovery time.  So you've got to get to know that. And it is it's about this being in a relationship  with the land and understanding what you do then observing and then getting that feedback  
**[0:09:08-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:09:08):**  and then re-planning your management.  You know, it's interesting, I'd actually taken that question in a slightly different way.  The way that you've answered it is once you're in that sort of regenerative approach to a  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:09:18):**  system, then how long having been grazed does it take for that paddock to recover before  you can put the animals back on to it, I suppose. And what I was what I was actually wondering  if somebody meant from that was how long, you know, a farm that has largely just been,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:09:31):**  you know, grazed in a mainstream standard kind of way, you know, for years, how long  would it take for that farm to start sort of producing in the way that you would expect  from a regenerative system? Because that wouldn't be seven weeks, it would be perhaps a year  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:09:45):**  or two.  Oh, there's so many different factors, it's pretty hard to say. But I mean, for instance,  on the projects we've worked on, you know, we're getting really good results within the  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:09:52):**  first year. I mean, it really depends on 100 different things, how much fertiliser has  been used in the past, because if that's the case, then there's going to be a bit of a  weaning off process where the plants adapt and start to build a relationship with the  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:10:03):**  soil food web. But you know, if we're going for that initial, if we can afford to, which  we try and encourage, particularly in the farms that are subsidised, they're not quite  so reliant on productivity for their income. And if there's an opportunity to reduce livestock  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:10:15):**  numbers so that we can create long recovery periods in the first year, we feel that's  a good investment, because that allows that sort of extra long recovery period, which  accelerates that recovery. And then by the year two and three, then you're really going  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:10:27):**  to be making great big leaps forward, I would certainly start with the longest you can get  away with. And I would think, you know, two months would be kind of where I'd be trying  to aim for as a starting minimum.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:10:36):**  Fantastic. I mean, as you say, and you know, we need to acknowledge this repeatedly throughout  this podcast that, you know, it all depends, doesn't it? It depends on you, on your land,  on your farm, on its history. And one of the things that's really important just to sort  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:10:50):**  of keep on coming back to is the fact that this isn't a new rules based approach. Regen  agriculture is different. And whether we're talking about kind of intensive mainstream  agriculture or organic, those are essentially input and extraction models, you know, to  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:11:04):**  a greater or lesser extent, whereas with Regen, it's a completely different mindset. And that's,  you know, that's one of the most difficult challenges. There aren't rules, it's different  for all farms, but there are foundations and understandings about the land that you guys  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:11:19):**  are brilliant at sharing, that help people to move ahead. I think Alex, you were going  to come in on this next question, number three, which is how does the grass grow without fertiliser  or farmyard manure? And will I see a drop in productivity?  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:11:32):**  Okay, thanks, Finnlow. So yeah, great question. In very simple terms, I would go back to,  okay, so how does the grass grow? It needs nutrients to grow, it needs sunlight, it needs  carbon dioxide, and it needs water. The key issue here, I think, with this question is  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:11:48):**  the nutrients probably in the water in a natural system, not that we've got many left, pristine  natural ecosystems, grasslands, you have got manure essentially, because you've got grazers,  herbivores grazing, but the nutrients is the key and the nutrients come from the soil.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:12:04):**  So if you've got a really healthy, high successional state soil, so this links back to Caroline's  answer to question number one, really, you have the availability of those nutrients within  that soil food web, you have complexity beneath the ground, and you have minerals cycling  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:12:20):**  and they are available to the plant to grow, whether it's ryegrass, or whether it's diverse  broadleaves in a in a sword doesn't really matter. So I think that's the key to growth  really. And that's why in a way, when we start to think about using fertilisers, we are looking  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:12:38):**  at a system that needs input. So my initial question with anything like that is, why is  an input needed? What is not, you know, what is that plant not getting from the soil that  it should be getting that we need to apply NPK to make it grow, it goes back to the root  
**[0:12:53-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:12:53):**  cause and the root reason, root, pardon the pun, of what grasses and plants need to grow  is the nutrients. And also the water element of it as well, if you've got complex and biodiverse  soils, you will have much better water cycling. So you'll have much better water availability  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:13:09):**  to your plants, even in times of drought and or floods, because the water will be in the  right places rather than all the wrong places. So I think that's the answer really is that  if if you have complex and biodiverse high successional state soils, then you won't need  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:13:23):**  artificial fertiliser to make grass grow. And if you do, it's telling you something  about the state of your soils.  And presumably the way that the animals are managed within that pasture will make a difference  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:13:33):**  as well, the amount that they're trampling and dunging and the way that they're moved  around in that area that that kind of will contribute to the speed of recovery and the  speed of productivity.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah, and I think the farmyard manure stroke, having animals graze elements, people maybe  sometimes think that, you know, you can replace the animals by just using manure. And that's  that's not the case. They're two very different things. So when you have an animal moving  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:13:58):**  across a grassland, it's especially if it's moving in such a way that it would perhaps  in a more natural grazing system, then it's it's not overgrazing the plant, it's dunging,  it's moving on, it's trampling that dung and pee in. And that's very different to a sort  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:14:14):**  of static sward where you're just spreading farmyard manure that might not have degraded  into that sward. So they're two very different things. And what you're doing with an animal  in that system is actually it's part of that system. So it's a more of a systems thinking  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:14:27):**  animal working with grasslands, working with soil all cycling together.  Do you know, do you know, both of you were concerned that, you know, we wouldn't have  a chance to get into the detail and two or three minutes answers just weren't going to  
**[0:14:38-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:14:38):**  be good enough. But we're, you know, we're quarter of an hour in and we've done three  questions. And I think we're doing pretty well here. So thank you both very much. Let's  whip on to question four. Caroline, I think you're going to lead on this. This is a question  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:14:50):**  that we've culled from a much bigger question that was emailed in. And we sort of split  it into two sections. But the first section is I'm locked into contracts for milk production  and I'm worried about a fall in production if I go to regenerative. So can I dip my toe  
**[0:15:05-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:15:05):**  in? Is there something that I can do on some land without having to commit everywhere?  And if so, how should I get started? What should I plant? And how should my management  change? Yeah, it's a great question. And this is one of the ones I was concerned about in  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:15:19):**  terms of being able to answer it in a concise way. But I think I think about breaking this  into two starting with the end of that question first, which is, how do I get started? And  is there a way that I can kind of play around with this? And initially, I would sort of  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:15:31):**  say, well, it's a kind of all in thing, Jen, because it's a whole systems thinking approach,  which means that if you're thinking of just taking one field and sort of using a particular  grazing regime on that one field, you may get some observations related to that grazing,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:15:44):**  but you're certainly not going to be able to see the bigger benefits, which are things  like dealing with the root cause of parasites so that you don't need to use worms anymore,  or as Alex has just explained, feed, you know, encouraging your plants to communicate with  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:15:57):**  the soil food web so that they don't need that soluble fertility anymore. And, you know,  making sure that you've got ultimate biodiversity in the whole system so that you don't have  things like face fly problems, or whatever it is that is a problem tends to come out  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:16:11):**  of the fact that you're not having that whole system approach. So I guess you've got to  be careful not to sort of throw the baby out with the bathwater if you do a little experiment,  and it's not, you know, it's not giving you these great results that you could achieve  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:16:22):**  on a whole farm approach. But that said, one of the things that I do if I do say a short  training course a couple of hours or something is I kind of teach the principles of how the  ecosystems work and then say go and have a look around your farm, look at the things  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:16:34):**  like the verges or where river banks have been fenced out. And then you can just learn  so much yourself by just saying, okay, well, that's had no grazing or that's had two pulses  of grazing a year. And that's done that and just start to dig in the soils and really  
**[0:16:47-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:16:47):**  look at you know, how healthy are the soils on one side of the fence to the other same  underlying geology, same climatic conditions, but completely different soils under two different  types of management. And as I said, in the kind of first couple of questions, we've got  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:16:59):**  a, and as you said, it's a paradigm shift, this is a completely different way of thinking.  And that's the biggest barrier to people being successful and regenerative is their mindset.  And this is a really good, great way to go and start to start to evolve your mindset  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:17:11):**  is looking at nature. And I think my background was in ecological kind of restoration. So  that's where I came at this from and then went into farming and then tried to sort of  blend the two and it's really about observing ecosystems, you can learn so much. And as  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:17:24):**  Alex said, we haven't got that many really healthy ecosystems. So that's a challenge  too. But just seeing what happens under different management is just so useful. Play around  with little paddocks, play around with fencing areas out in a, you know, if you've got a  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:17:34):**  field that you're grazing under one type of regime, put a cage on top of a little patch  so that you can leave it for an extra recovery period, see what happens and just start to  observe and that'll really help to shift that mindset forward. So back to the first part  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:17:48):**  of the question, which is I'm locked into a contract with milk production. A huge part  of our holistic management work is about this big picture, sort of triple bottom line, holistic,  whatever you want to call it, but thinking beyond just production. So I always try and  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:18:00):**  encourage farmers that I'm working with to sort of start to look at their profit and  loss accounts, really have some detailed information in front of them and then sort of say, okay,  profitability comes in two forms. One is an increase in production, which is where most  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:18:12):**  farmers tend to move, you know, that's where they're aiming at. But actually what I feel  is the biggest opportunity is to actually look at your costs and if you can get rid  of your costs or you can reduce them right now, then you could probably afford to be  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:18:22):**  less productive and you'd be more profitable. So we've got to kind of reframe that a little  bit and I would sort of encourage that farmer to say, is it serving me to be locked into  that contract with milk production? Is it, if you're in a situation where somebody's  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:18:35):**  forcing you to maintain production and you're not able to manoeuvre your management in any  way, is that helpful? Or do you want for your own life? You know, this is the sort of questions  we get into in the training, you know, okay, the economics are one thing, productivity  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:18:46):**  is one thing, but then, you know, is that a sustainable way forward long term for your  farm? Is that what you want to be doing with your life? You know, is that, yeah, is that  serving you? So really we go back, I would be going back drawing kind of back from thinking,  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:18:58):**  yeah, is this the right thing for me being in this contract? And could we be much more  profitable if actually we just cut our cross by using regenerative practices and then maybe  we'd drop our production for a while or for a long term, but still be in a better, more  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:19:11):**  resilient position moving forward.  But that would mean presumably, you know, if people were sort of turning their back  on a contract that they've been farming for the last 10, 20 years, then again, that's  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:19:21):**  part of that big mindset shift, isn't it? Is thinking, you know, where else, how else  can I sell what I'm producing? Is milk the best thing to be producing? Can I produce  other things as well as milk on this farm?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:19:31):**  Absolutely. And again, the principles of managing an ecosystem come into our business too, you  know, it's, is it sensible to have all your eggs in one basket means you're very vulnerable,  you know, so we should be looking at how can we, and again, you've got to be careful with  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:19:44):**  diversification. I've been in a situation where I diversified far too much and then  ended up being a busy fool. So, you know, there's always a balance, but I think being  vulnerable and locked into one thing is possibly a little bit like the principles of monoculture  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:19:57):**  versus ecosystem. So that's a bit dangerous. But, and again, just trying to get to a system  that's powered by sunlight rather than relying on fossil fuels and payments is, you know,  in holistic management, we call that paper money when you're relying on, you know, subsidies  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:20:11):**  or whatever contracts, that sort of thing. And really what we were aiming to do in general  to just get to the point where our incomes comes from converting sunlight without the  need for any inputs that are expensive. So that's the truth, a resilient situation to  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:20:24):**  be in. And I know Alex, you've got some thoughts on sort of, you know, how do we create these  food systems, haven't you, in terms of they're not there at the moment, then the kind of  the purchasing options are not there for these farmers, are they?  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:20:34):**  Thanks, Caroline. That's, that's a really good lead in. That's something I was going  to pick up from this question. From the other side of the fence in a way really is the whole  system that underpins these, these contracts and with various different hats and various  
**[0:20:47-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:20:47):**  different people in organisations, we're very interested in looking at that end of the supply  chain and seeing how we can assist with the shift and the transition to regeneration to  create those markets, to create the route to market really. And that's a huge part of  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:21:03):**  it. And it's very important, particularly in the dairy sector, I think.  Thank you very much, both. I think that's a really good start. And actually, that's  maybe a question time podcast in the future is to, you know, look at these, these sort  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:21:14):**  of transitional opportunities and the farmers who, you know, have been doing something for  2030 years and are really interested in changing and it's sort of going into a bit more detail  in those kind of, you know, what do we do first? How do we start thinking about that?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:21:27):**  You already have a lot of training that's part of your Roots of Nature website, and  you're working on new training, I think at the moment as well, to help individual farmers  to get a real handle on some of these questions and to think about them in terms of their  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:21:41):**  own farm without in this COVID environment necessarily needing to have a farm visit themselves.  Yeah, absolutely. We're sort of evolving all the time, really, because every time we work  with a new farmer, you get new insights and just like what we teach, you know, we're constantly  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:21:55):**  having to evolve our own sort of business ecosystem, if you like. So we've got a range  of different things to do. And Alex is involved in certain projects, and I'm involved in others,  and then we cross over on quite a few. So my husband, I and Alex have an organisation  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:22:07):**  called World of Culture. And that's where we're looking at how do we do regenerative  in the Netherlands, which I think we're covering in a question later. So we've got a kind of  three day training that we offer through that. And then Roots of Nature consultancy, we're  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:22:17):**  really starting to understand now, the need for sort of transitioning is huge. And actually  what I think we're getting better at is kind of poaching people. So it's more than it's  actually not so much being a consultant and going in and saying, this is what you need  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:22:31):**  to do. It's quite the opposite. You sort of teach the principles which have to happen  on a kind of foundation course that you have to give that enough time to really let those  in bed. And then it's about creating a support network of expertise that gets this sort of  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:22:44):**  way of working.  And sort of a buddying approach almost.  Yeah, I'd say so. And actually, what my kind of recent thinking is that we need some sort  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:22:52):**  of coaching programme for people transitioning. And I think that's what we're hoping to work  on next. How do we do that in a way that's affordable and easily accessible to farmers  so they don't have to necessarily leave the farm? So that's kind of the next big step.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:23:05):**  And then again, Primal Web is trying to create that community. So one of the things that  people that are transitioning, farmers that are transitioning find the most difficult  is the pressure from the neighbours. It's a huge thing in farming. I remember it well  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:23:16):**  when I was an incomer to the area and, you know, do things a little bit differently.  There's an enormous amount of pressure from people looking over the fence and what they  may or may not be saying about you. So creating a network where people can just go and really  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:23:29):**  encourage people to share their what's gone wrong. I started with burn to sort of fail  forward farming that we need to be taking this kind of learner mindset of it's an experimental  mindset of actually you need to test something, see what you get as a feedback and then mend  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:23:43):**  your management is a constant process of failing learning and replanning. And I think when  you get to that point where we're willing to do that and then willing to talk about  that, then we're really making some progress. And so Primal Web is set up to people to share  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:23:56):**  any of their successes, but really importantly share what they've learnt through their failures  and again, reframing what is a failure because it's not, it's just learning. So yeah, we  need to create a community. We need to create a support network of people that can sort  
**[0:24:10-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:24:10):**  of say, look, it's all right. You know, this is going to take you years. You don't get  there. There is no there. It's just a constant evolution of one learning process after another.  So yeah. And Primal Web is of course fantastic for that because while this question time  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:24:23):**  on the podcast, you know, we're trying to answer things every six weeks or so. The forum  is of course much more immediate and if people have got questions then you know, there are  responses that come in very, very rapidly. And of course part of that mindset change  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:24:35):**  is about thinking of failure differently. Actually, you use the term, was it failure  forward? And for me, everything that you do, you're learning something from. And so each  failure if you like, it's just a building block to better knowledge. Question number  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:24:49):**  five, what are the best breeds of cattle and sheep to use in a regenerative system?  Okay, so I love this question. Short answer is, well, no, there isn't really a short answer.  Breeds is an interesting... Go on, you've got 30 seconds. No, I'm joking.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:25:05):**  I might have to start that one again. Matching the, yeah, the short answer is match the breed  to the system. So I think one thing I am not too hung up on is pedigree status. Probably  you get lots of negative comments about that. You don't want to pay £350,000 for your taxel.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:25:24):**  I saw that, yeah. I'm more interested in the functionality of an individual animal for  its own benefit, for the benefit of the land and the benefit of the product, either be  that the meat or the milk or the wool that comes from that animal, whether it's got brownies  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:25:41):**  or green legs or three tails, I'm not too fussed. But I also recognise that from a human  and societal and cultural perspective, there is great history and great context to some  of these breeds. And I'm not knocking that at all. I want to marry the two, I guess,  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:25:57):**  because certainly within Great Britain, there's a wealth of fantastic breeding, which was  underpinned by breeding for the system, actually. So breeds that were developed for the geographical  regions in which they were growing. So there is an enormous wealth and value in that. I  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:26:16):**  just don't want it to seem to go to the extreme, I suppose, where we're selecting for the things  that those breeds weren't originally selected for. If you want to have a truly regenerative  system, you really want an animal that matches the diversity of the swole that you have in  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:26:31):**  that particular system, be that lowland or upland or mountainous or whatever. And then  then not only are you getting the greatest benefit from that animal in terms of its ability  to complement the system and enhance the health of the soil and the diversity of the sward  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:26:46):**  and so on, but you're enhancing the life of that animal also, because it's going to much  more likely have everything it needs within your system. And you shouldn't have to be  providing it with perhaps extra feed or supplements and that kind of thing. And also building  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:27:03):**  into that, not just the genetics, but the epigenetics that go alongside and the immune  systems and immune resilience that go alongside good breeding for the right reasons that make  animals more resilient to infections and diseases and so on. But that's a huge kind of words  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:27:18):**  which we can maybe get into at another time. But the short answer is match breeds to systems.  Thank you. Number six, here's a question that's come in from Twitter. Is there a line to draw  between regenerative, almost organic pasture management and so-called sustainable intensification  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:27:35):**  of pasture and grazing ruminants? And if so, where is that line?  Yeah, I don't like drawing lines between things because it's always a continuum with these  things. But what I think the key thing for me about regenerative systems are they take  
**[0:27:50-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:27:50):**  care of humans, animals and land and sea. And by land, I mean the natural system underpinning  the animals and the humans. And so one thing that does sometimes drive potentially, not  necessarily the wrong direction, but a direction that I don't consider particularly regenerative  
**[0:28:07-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:28:07):**  is when we get too hung up on single metrics. And one metric that is often used is the greenhouse  gases per kilogram of meat or milk produced, something like that, some kind of carbon equivalence  metric, which has its absolutely has its place. We've clearly got an environmental crisis  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:28:27):**  looming current. But I think the purpose of the regenerative approach is to take all of  these things into consideration, not just the carbon equivalence, because that can send  you down the rabbit hole of being what I call slave to the carbon, really. And we must incorporate  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:28:42):**  animals and people and social elements and the whole, not just the carbon equivalence,  but the whole biodiversity issues of soil health and biodiversity up the trophic levels.  It makes it more difficult, I understand that. But I do think it's absolutely critical that  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:28:59):**  we don't become single metric focused.  I guess, you know, partly behind that is that the whole drive towards sustainable intensification,  which to me is an oxymoron in itself anyway, but it is, as you say, it's putting on a pedestal  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:29:11):**  the climate crisis without recognising that there is a parallel crisis in the collapse  in biodiversity. And what we're trying to do with regenerative agriculture is exactly  as you said, there is to broaden the objectives. So the objectives aren't just food and climate  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:29:27):**  resilience, the objectives are food and climate resilience and biodiversity restoration and  better working lives for the people involved, better animal welfare, a whole range of different  outcomes, which all need to be considered together.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:29:41):**  Absolutely. And they are intrinsically linked. I mean, it is one big system of which we are  a part and you cannot focus on one single metric because you do that at the perils of  ignoring the rest. And if you ignore the rest, you won't achieve that one single metric anyway.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:29:56):**  Fantastic. We're on the homeward straight. Number seven, how can I use regenerative agriculture  when I'm in an upland area?  Ooh, this is a good question and it leads into our wilde culture work. So there's lots  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:30:08):**  of great work and examples of people using regenerative systems. I always encourage people  not to think of it as a kind of set of principles that they can just adopt. You've got to, as  we keep saying, going back to this, you know, you're in a relationship with that landscape  
**[0:30:20-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:30:20):**  yourself. You've got to kind of, you know, have your own system. But there is examples  in lowland areas of how can that be achieved, you know, paddocking down into smaller areas,  et cetera. But of course, when you start to get into the upland context, that is much  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:30:33):**  more challenging. And, you know, I live in the Lake District, Alex lives in the Peak  District and we work in Scotland and the Highlands quite a bit. And there's many different elements  that just couldn't work in that system. You know, you've just got the practicalities of  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:30:46):**  fencing huge areas. You've got different soil building processes. You're working with organic  soils and peatlands often. You're often working with kind of hefted common land systems where  there's shared farming over with no fences over huge areas of upland, you know, whether  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:31:01):**  it's a fell or a moorland or then you've got other types of land use such as grouse management  and deer management and all of those things kind of in with it. And it's it basically  means it's just a completely different animal. So wilde culture, we set up to start to explore  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:31:18):**  trying to have some running examples of how we could make this work. And each kind of  region will have a different approach and each farm will have a different approach.  Everything has to be completely unique and bespoke. But some of the ways that we're achieving  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:31:29):**  that is we're starting to call it a kind of hybrid between rewilding and regenerative  grazing. So on a couple of the projects that we're running at reasonable scale, we have  kind of broken the farm into two blocks. One is the what we might call the upland block,  
**[0:31:45-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:31:45):**  which is higher, rougher, less productive. Then we've got the kind of more productive  lower block or in by whatever the regional term would be for that and where you've got  sort of grassland state. And what it's looking like on those couple of projects is that we've  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:31:59):**  sort of got this, we're trying to get to, if you want carbon neutral, but you know,  basically where we're not, we're sequestering more carbon and we're constantly advancing  ecosystem processes. And ideally getting to the point where it's just, we're getting rid  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:32:11):**  of all of the input costs. So we're trying to get a profitable system that's still productive,  probably not going to be as productive as some of the lowland systems, but still what  it does produce is extremely nutrient dense foods. So in order to do that, what we're  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:32:23):**  saying, we've divided it into blocks. We would be resting the upland block all summer potentially.  And again, there's no sort of set way of doing this. It's just how it's working on these  particular farms so that you can let that area regenerate towards woodland. So we want  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:32:36):**  a wood pasture type environment, which is going to invite, sort of have really nice  diverse swards mixed in with spaced out trees. And there is a scrub and some maximum biodiversity,  not lots of shade and shelter through the winter. And you know, lots of different species  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:32:52):**  coming back in their own way. So sort of, you know, it's leading itself to some degree,  but we're just priming the system through improved ecosystem processes. So that would  rest all summer while we graze the in-buy areas in a more classically regenerative kind  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:33:05):**  of paddock grazing type system. So the herd of cattle, for instance, and it could include  sheep in the in-buy areas. We won't go into the details about why sheep may or may not  work on the upland areas. And we can have that for another topic maybe. But you'd paddock  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:33:20):**  graze the in-buy so that you don't make hay. So traditionally on these fell farms, these  upland farms, you would be sort of growing the hay crop while the animals were up the  hill, then you would be cutting the hay crop, which is cutting off that photosynthesis,  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:33:31):**  which is so critical for soil building and all of the good stuff that we want to happen,  so that you could provide the feed for the winter while the animals are in a shed, or  while the nutrition has gone out of the sort of upland area. So we're kind of turning that  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:33:45):**  on its head a little bit. And we're saying, well, we're not going to cut for hay because  we want to maximise photosynthesis, we're going to graze instead of cut, which means  there's always photosynthesising throughout the season, we can maximise our productivity  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:33:56):**  and sort of make a profitable enterprise from that sort of element of the management. And  then in winter, we're going for like a deferred grazing system where the animals go up the  hill and they eat what's been rested all summer. So it's kind of banked grass all summer. And  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:34:11):**  it's a transitional process. It'll take a few years to get there. But we were aiming  to the point where we don't have to feed at all up there. We're already sort of making  great progress there. But there's still a bit of hay being fed to the latter end of  
**[0:34:22-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:34:22):**  the winter. But the animals are able to move around the whole area, they don't get paddocked  up there. And that will allow for succession to woodland. And the animals are just healthier  and as I say, we were aiming to get to a point where there's virtually no cost, but still  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:34:35):**  an output in a sort of production engine, if you like.  Brilliant. So the simple answer is yes, you can use regenerative agriculture in an upland  area, but it's different. And again, you know, it's all about the individual farm. And clearly  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:34:46):**  your experience there is one to be shared. And people can get in touch with you for more  information, I guess, through the Primal Web Forum, which is superb. I'm going to skip  on. And I guess the sort of central to this next question is probably, you know, something  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:35:00):**  that a lot of farmers who are interested in regen, a thought process they kind of go through,  I can see mob grazing, I can see it working on other farms, I've watched maybe some of  the carbon cowboys films, and it's amazing what can happen. But I'm really not confident  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:35:15):**  that it can happen on my farm. So number eight, can I do mob grazing with dairy cows considering  they normally turn their noses up at anything more than six inches tall, with a stem and  tramplet and just stand there blaring?  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:35:27):**  Yeah, good question. It's not my area of expertise, dairy, I have to say, but you know, there's  lots of people doing it, and not necessarily in this country yet. But I think there's some  good examples. What I would say is, again, this is a whole system sort of thinking approach.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:35:40):**  So if you have just got a fairly, if you just got a rye grass dominated sward, and you just  let that go to seed, and then you try and get your existing dairy herd to eat it, then  you're probably going to get a lot of blaring. So you need to look at, you know, how do we  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:35:51):**  adapt the system? And how do we get the right animals, as Alex was explaining, to fit that  system. So, again, diversity would be key. So you've not got everything going to seed  at the same time, trying to introduce your animals, go through the dry cows first, so  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:36:04):**  that you're not sort of compromising the nutritional needs of the main dairy herd, trying to select  for the animals that do best on that slightly different systems, the whole range of things  to kind of address all at once. But I'd say that there is people doing it. I think diversity  
**[0:36:18-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:36:18):**  is absolutely essential.  I think the diversity thing for me is is central to this, because within a diverse sward, all  of those different plants are going to be at different vegetative stages at different  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:36:28):**  times. So that, yes, it might be tall grass, but there might still be some very young early  stage growth in there, which is tasty. So it's that blend, it's that lots of different  things at different stages, which helps. And I think, yeah, dairy cows is one of the biggest  
**[0:36:42-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:36:42):**  areas of potential growth for regenerative systems. And also one of the areas for the  biggest challenges, one of which is the current, you know, route to market system that we have.  So I think those that are doing more regenerative dairy systems may or may not be I don't again,  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:36:59):**  it's not my area of expertise, but they they may have different routes to market. So it  comes back to that question we talked about earlier is tackling this from the other side  as well from the not just the consumer, but also the guys in the middle.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:37:11):**  Exactly. And wouldn't it be nice if we got to a point where dairy farmers are getting  paid a high premium for high nutritional quality rather than just production. And then then  we could afford to sort of maybe drop the production to allow us to transition to get  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:37:23):**  healthier soils and increase the diversity and all sort of works together. So yeah, again,  it's part of this whole system. Let's move on to number nine.  Oh, Finlow, can I just chip in there? Please do.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:37:34):**  Yeah. So just to add to that, Finlow, I think the importance or the potential importance  of greater nutrient density in the milk. One thing that we haven't really talked about  actually today is human health and the importance or the value of regenerative systems in creating,  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:37:48):**  you know, maybe, you know, animal based products, be it milk or meat that have a greater nutrient  density for our own human health benefits. Fantastic. Let's move on. Number nine, Alex,  when we're talking about moving animals around a lot more potentially confined in smaller  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:38:03):**  spaces away from trees and hedgerows where there's less shade and shelter, is farm animal  welfare a consideration? That's an easy one to answer. Yes. Farm animal  welfare is always a key consideration within all of this. For me, it harks back to the  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:38:22):**  systems thinking approach so that for number one, you have the right animals in the right  system. So if you're in hot parts of the world, you have heat tolerant animals and so on and  so forth. And if you're in cold and wet parts of the world, you have animals with, you know,  
**[0:38:37-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:38:37):**  appropriately thick coats in the winter and that kind of thing. So right animal in the  right environment. But also in terms of the regenerative system, I think yes, shelter  and shade are absolutely essential. It's a great opportunity to integrate trees into  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:38:55):**  grazing systems, but also in terms of the grazing system itself, if you have a more  diverse sward and you have tall grass grazing, then you know, the sort of environment, if  you imagine yourself as an individual standing in a field that's just been cut for silage  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:39:12):**  in contrast to a field that has lots of tall grasses and broad leaves, and it's a hot day,  they are two very different environments. And so it's not a straightforward, easy question  to answer that in that sense, because I think we have to think about all the elements that  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:39:27):**  go towards ensuring good animal welfare is taken into consideration.  And it's one of those things that often seems to be kind of left out of some of the definitions  around regen agriculture, isn't it? I think a lot of people feel that it's implicit, but  
**[0:39:39-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:39:39):**  actually it's important, certainly in a UK context where we're working on this and we're  building our own definition to make it explicit. Absolutely. Yeah. And if you, you know, the  definition of a truly regenerative system is that the animals within that system genuinely  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:39:55):**  have all their needs and wants met. We're running out of time. We've got one more question  and it's a big question. And I know that you're going to want to talk about it for ages. And  I think actually let's just touch into it. And then we can do another podcast, which  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:40:09):**  looks at it in more detail. Number 10, can regenerative agriculture help with endemic  animal health issues like liver fluke and lameness in sheep?  I absolutely 100% think so. Yes. For me that again, I keep sound like a stuck record talking  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:40:25):**  about systems thinking, but these endemic health issues, which we have found ourselves  in a place where we sort of, I wouldn't say we accept them, we don't accept them, we treat  for them, but we sort of accept that they occur. And I think we, Regen gives us an opportunity  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:40:40):**  to question why these health issues have become such a sort of, oh, of course they get this.  Of course they get that. And I think we have to think about the relationship between the  animals, the land, the plants, the nutrition that they're consuming, the resilience of  
**[0:40:55-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:40:55):**  those animals in the systems, the way they're grazing in the systems. All of those things  are intrinsically linked and underpin health. So for me, these endemic health issues are  about underlying ecosystem health. And when I say ecosystem, I mean, right from the microbes  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:41:13):**  in the soil up to the, you know, the mammals, the livestock across all the things in between,  you know all the plants and the birds and the small mammals and invertebrates, everything.  In a regenerative system, health is optimised because it is resilient and functioning optimally.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:41:31):**  I know that's a big cop out because it doesn't address any of the detail.  That's great. And we'll do the detail, you know, we will, we'll come back and we'll look  at the detail, you know, on some of this because, you know, we've got some good examples I know  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:41:43):**  that we can talk through. Anything, any sort of final thoughts, anything to add in Caroline?  I just completely agree. And as I say, it's a huge subject, but I think, as Alex said,  we need to be thinking about the whole health of the system. And I often say that, you know,  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:41:55):**  actually, I deal with conservation organisations as well, and they are missing the trick too,  because the wildlife populations are not healthy. So it is everything in the system gets healthier,  including our animals. And, and actually, just to highlight that we're doing some work  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:42:07):**  Alex is leading on, we're calling sort of red data species work, which is a lot of the  times management is falling down on the back of maybe one or two problems. We again, we  don't even like calling them problem species, but species that are causing us problems,  
**[0:42:19-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:42:19):**  as we say, whether that be liver fluke or whatever, but we're doing is like a deep dive  into that organism. So what you do in holistic management, and the way that we kind of think  about this is you you explore the organisms life cycle, you look at its weak link, then  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:42:31):**  you look at how can you tweak the management to kind of suppress that, you know, organism  thriving and get things back into balance, you don't want to get rid of that organism,  but it's got to be more in balance. So a big part of our kind of work at the moment is  
**[0:42:43-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:42:43):**  looking at some examples of things like ticks and fluke and you know, certain tapeworms.  And again, that's kind of a process that we're getting better and better at. So that's something  to watch for the future.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-ekk722#t=0:42:53):**  Fantastic. You've both been amazing. You've you've managed to whiz through these questions  and there's so much knowledge that you know, we've scraped off you today. So that really  is all we have time for.

### Farm Gate  (Mon, 13 Dec 2021 17:17:48)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:09):**  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. It had been hoped that COP26 would be the  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:15):**  COP where food systems, soil and agriculture would finally make it to the top negotiating  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:20):**  table. From this perspective at least, Glasgow's Conference of the Parties on Climate Change  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:25):**  was not a success. But as discussed in the last programme, food systems, soil and agriculture  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:30):**  did at last emerge as key themes at side events inside the COP Conference Village, a prelude  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:36):**  one can hope to serious discussion at COP27 and 28. And the Glasgow Food and Climate Declaration,  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:42):**  initiated by Nourish Scotland and IPES Food, was a key factor in pushing this focus on  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:48):**  food systems up the policy agenda. The declaration is a commitment for sub-national governments  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:54):**  to tackle the climate emergency through integrated food policies, as well as a call on national  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:59):**  governments to act. It's supported by the FAO, the Food and Agricultural Organization  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:03):**  of the UN, and by international non-governmental organisations such as WWF and the Carbon Neutral  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:09):**  Cities Alliance. The declaration has been signed by the Scottish government and by local  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:14):**  authorities from around the world, from Bristol to Milan, from Equisigo to Lyon, from Valencia  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:19):**  to Istanbul and Vancouver. Today, I'm joined by Pete Ritchie, the Executive Director of  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:25):**  Nourish Scotland, and by Chantelle Clement, Deputy Director of IPES Food. Welcome both.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:31):**  Chantelle, can I come to you first and start with the background to the Glasgow Food and  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:35):**  Climate Declaration. Where did it come from and what is it that sub-national governments  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:40):**  are signing up to do?  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:42):**  Firstly, thanks so much for having us and for the introduction on what the Glasgow Declaration  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:46):**  is all about. As you said, the climate cop is really the formal moment when governments  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:50):**  have the opportunity to develop ambitious national commitments to tackle climate change.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:54):**  For years now, there's been this growing momentum to link food systems to those discussions,  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:59):**  given their role, of course, in being either part of the solution or a huge part of the  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:02):**  problem.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:03):**  The Glasgow Food and Climate Declaration was in part a response to that, really just to  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:08):**  make food a bigger part of the global climate agenda. The specific entry point that IPES  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:12):**  Food, Nourish Scotland, and our many partners identified was that while national governments  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:17):**  may be dragging their feet to actually implement ambitious climate plans, sub-national and  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:21):**  local authorities are definitely not. It's really often at the local and the regional  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:25):**  levels that we're seeing some of the most exciting work being done to transform our  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:29):**  food systems, not just to make them more climate resilient and climate mitigating, but to bring  
**[0:02:33-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:33):**  about a whole host of other benefits as well that I'm sure we'll talk about.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:36):**  Really, I think the problem is when national governments are making commitments around  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:40):**  food, which are really few and far between, they're focusing primarily on agricultural  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:45):**  production and land use specifically. But we are seeing at the sub-national level that  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:49):**  they're taking a much more systemic approach to the problem by developing integrated food  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:53):**  policies that not only aim to tackle those areas, but other aspects of the system as  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:58):**  well. So things like food waste, land use, access, diets, environmental justice, and  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:03):**  really a whole host of other issues as part of this comprehensive strategy. And again,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:07):**  it's really just at the local level that we're seeing the most recognition for all of these  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:11):**  issues, the interconnection between them, and this acknowledgement that we have to address  
**[0:03:15-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:15):**  them together if we really want to solve the climate emergency.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:18):**  So concretely, the Glasgow Food and Climate Declaration was a call to action. It was also  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:23):**  a statement really just to recognize local action in tackling climate change because  
**[0:03:27-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:27):**  they just haven't been getting the support and the recognition they deserve in these  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:30):**  global spaces. And of course, the declaration also called on national governments to really  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:34):**  just step up and to take the role of food and farming as seriously as local authorities  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:39):**  are. And of course, in signing on, local authorities committed to renew their commitments by following  
**[0:03:43-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:43):**  through on their own integrated food policies. And I think the hundred or so cities that  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:46):**  actually joined us at COP was really a testament to that.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:49):**  World Finance and Peter, I wonder if you could build on what Chantal's just said there. The  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:52):**  declaration itself notes that cities and regions are leading the way in pioneering these integrated  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:58):**  food policies at local level, to drive the food system change that you want to see. And  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:03):**  I just wonder if you could give us some examples of what's already happening.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:07):**  Yeah, no, absolutely, Finlow. And Chantal's right, this is about implementation. Some  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:11):**  of the practical things that local authorities are doing are actually to deliver on a more  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:14):**  sustainable food system. And that will vary depending on the local authority, its powers,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:19):**  and what's the most important thing for its citizens and its politicians. So in Quito,  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:24):**  for example, there's a big effort to make the food system more resilient, and to be  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:27):**  able to source more of the food for the city from within the region. That's been a key  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:33):**  issue in Covid, as we've seen a lot of cities turn around and say, where does our food come  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:36):**  from anyway? And realising that there's no local supply chains to feed the city. Then  
**[0:04:41-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:41):**  you've got Malmo being at this for a long time. You know, the last 10 years they've  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:44):**  reduced their greenhouse gas emissions to their food system by 30%. They've increased  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:48):**  their organic procurement to 70%. You know, clear practical action. And then we've got  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:53):**  really small cities like Morinot-sur-Tout in France, gone 100% organic in their canteens  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:57):**  just by taking action locally and saying, we can fix this. Catalonia has got a new food  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:01):**  strategy where it's linking the urban and rural dimensions and saying, we have to connect  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:06):**  these things because we've got a strong demand from urban consumers for agro-cological products.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:11):**  But we need to make that real in terms of how we transform our land use system. São  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:15):**  Paulo is joining the dots between organic healthy farmers, convert to organic within  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:20):**  the city boundaries, preserving the rainforest as part of their city, and increasing livelihoods  
**[0:05:25-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:25):**  for those farmers and getting their produce to market. And then much closer to home, we've  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:28):**  got Fife is already linking farmers into local procurement. We've got Bristol tackling food  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:33):**  waste. We've got London banning junk food adverts, and all of these different practical  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:38):**  actions where local authorities are using the powers they do have to push integrated  
**[0:05:42-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:42):**  food systems along.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:43):**  World Finance, you talk there about the power of local authority procurement in the same  
**[0:05:48-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:48):**  way that we think about government procurement, and the way in which they can say, well, in  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:51):**  our canteens, or perhaps in our schools, we can try and source food locally. But I'm wondering  
**[0:05:57-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:57):**  how cities contribute to bringing food in that's grown around the region of that authority  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:04):**  area. How they change the market dynamics, if indeed they can, to bring more food in  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:10):**  to local markets, and to get that food distributed within areas of the city that aren't directly  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:16):**  related to the local authority itself – the buildings that they own.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:21):**  Sure. And I mean, Leon's a very good example of that, where they're supporting farmers  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:24):**  in the region to bring their produce into – not into schools, but into community centres  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:30):**  and markets, in the less affluent parts of the city, and actually subsidising those farmers'  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:35):**  markets and that produce to make that more available to people. So cities can do more,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:39):**  but it's really important to recognise that public procurement, public food, does two  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:43):**  really important things. One, it normalises, if you like, a more sustainable diet. It says  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:48):**  this is something that everybody can eat. We can all shift a little bit towards more  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:52):**  plant-based diets. We can all shift a bit towards less processed food, more local products.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:56):**  And the other thing is, it does send a market signal. It's really important to recognise  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:00):**  the market signal that government and local authorities send when they change public procurement.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:04):**  And we saw that most notably, obviously, in Copenhagen, where their decision to go organic  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:09):**  in their public food, you know, actually underpinned the whole organic revolution in Denmark.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:13):**  And does this generally depend on one or two really motivated people at local government  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:19):**  level? Or is there a more strategic approach that you're starting to sort of witness around  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:24):**  the world where this issue is just on the agenda and it's as talked about as bin collection  
**[0:07:29-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:29):**  or street lighting?  
**[0:07:30-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:30):**  Ian Mayne I think it varies from city to city. I mean,  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:33):**  there's absolutely no doubt that in the South Park, this is at the very top level of the  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:37):**  city's priorities and the most senior people were represented in the discussions around  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:41):**  the Glasgow Declaration. Similarly in Bristol, at the launch, we had the deputy mayor come  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:46):**  and talk. And it's absolutely clear in Bristol that food policy is high up the council's  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:50):**  agenda. It's a core part of their circular economy, their climate change, they're making  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:54):**  Bristol a green city, you know, it's not shoved away in a back pocket somewhere. In other  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:58):**  cities, it's a second order issue. But I think what's happening is that we're seeing it more  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:03):**  and more become a first order issue. And things like the Glasgow Declaration can help cities  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:07):**  see that putting food up the agenda gives them that sort of wider voice on the international  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:12):**  stage. Also, as they see other cities doing things, they start to make the connections  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:16):**  to their own climate change plans, their own attempts to improve children's health, reduce  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:21):**  inequities and the need for food banks, they start to see food policy, integrated food  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:25):**  policy as a first order issue.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:27):**  David Pembroke Chantelle, do you have thoughts on that as  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:29):**  well?  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:30):**  Chantelle Mancuso Yeah, I was going to pick up on your idea  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:31):**  that you know, there's always one or two key people who really set the motion for things  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:34):**  to happen. And I would say that despite I think all of the very relevant things that  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:38):**  Pete just said, champions are definitely a key enabler that we've seen across the board.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:42):**  Only to get things started. So when cities are sort of more at the beginning of their  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:45):**  food systems journey and developing a strategy, having those key people within the municipal  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:50):**  authorities is crucial. But I would also add that another key enabler is not just the champions  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:54):**  who are within the government, but the residents and the organizations who have sometimes been  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:58):**  working on these issues for years, if not decades. I'm thinking of some of the cities,  
**[0:09:02-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:02):**  Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, were talking to us about some of these volunteer food policy  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:06):**  councils that have been operating for again, a couple decades that eventually become sort  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:10):**  of more officially recognized and then work very closely with municipal authorities to  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:14):**  really get things going. So I think we really shouldn't underestimate not just the power  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:18):**  of residents themselves in making things happen, but especially in the collaborations between  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:23):**  municipal authorities and some of these organizations working on the ground. And as Pete was mentioning,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:28):**  certainly during COVID, we saw that significantly. Sao Paulo is another great example for that  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:32):**  New Haven as well. These citizen groups working with the municipal council just to allow for  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:36):**  redistribution of food, especially to get to more marginalized groups during the pandemic.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:40):**  That was a huge advantage when they work together.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:43):**  It's interesting you mentioned marginalized groups there, because I was just wondering  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:46):**  about whether there is a distinction between the ability to change and reform poorer communities  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:53):**  that are more dependent on those sort of relationships with local authorities to supply food that's  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:59):**  coming into those communities. You know, local authorities are working with food banks, they're  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:03):**  working with people who are in poorer communities, and they're not necessarily working directly  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:08):**  with people in more affluent communities who just go to Waitrose and buy what they always  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:13):**  buy.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:14):**  When you look at the pattern of all the family food survey stuff, all the data, what you'll  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:18):**  find there is that if you try distinguishing those dietary intakes, people will tend to  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:24):**  eat about the same amount of the stuff that we think is bad for you. And what's different  
**[0:10:28-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:28):**  is that more affluent people are able to eat more of the stuff that's good for you, you  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:31):**  know, so more fruit and vegetables, more nuts, a little bit more protein, but not meat protein.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:36):**  So you know, it's not as if people have hugely different diets here. But I think what local  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:41):**  authorities can do, we were just hearing an example of that yesterday from Lancaster,  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:44):**  quite a small town in the UK, where the council is just going out to ordinary restaurants  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:50):**  and saying, look, could you be a bit more plant based here, and councils can do that  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:54):**  in a way, particularly if they're relatively small, they can create a sort of city feel,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:59):**  which is look, why don't we all eat a bit more plant based food and Bruges and Ghent,  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:04):**  I think in Belgium, both are good examples of that. There's other councils which have  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:08):**  tried a meat free Monday or veggie Thursday that goes beyond just what they do in the  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:12):**  schools and says, look, why don't we all take a day off meat? Why do we all really eat our  
**[0:11:17-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:17):**  veggies this day?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:18):**  And that's not necessarily about telling people that meat in its in and of itself is a bad  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:22):**  thing to eat, but it's about trying to provoke greater diversity in the diet overall.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:27):**  Absolutely, yeah. And just saying, eating a wider range of things being a bit more imaginative  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:32):**  and what we what we put on our plates, you know, it's good for health, and it's also  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:36):**  good for the planet, and it's good for nature. And I think cities and local government can  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:40):**  get away with setting that sort of tone, which certainly in the UK sometimes feels bringing  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:45):**  that simply from national government can actually create a little bit of sense of resistance.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:49):**  Chantelle, that kind of brings us on to the next subject that I wanted to discuss and  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:53):**  that the declaration centred on the need to support action on global warming. But the  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:57):**  text acknowledges some of the complexity of the challenge, which we were, you know, we  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:02):**  were starting to get into then, whether it's discussions about, you know, meat or not meat,  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:07):**  the amount of diversity that's in people's diets. And the declaration talks about food  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:11):**  systems contributing between 21 and 37% of total greenhouse gases. Now, that's an enormous  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:17):**  level of variance. And not only that, but in the same sentence, it's talking about the  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:22):**  impact that food systems have on biodiversity loss, hunger and malnutrition, and the escalating  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:27):**  public health crisis. And I wonder if you think that this complexity that's inherent  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:32):**  in the food system is why national governments and international processes are so reluctant  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:37):**  to bring food systems to places like the cop top table?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:41):**  I think for starters, nobody likes complexity, to be honest, at least of all policymakers.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:46):**  And to be fair, that's really a practical issue, because it seems, you know, just much  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:50):**  easier to tackle singular issues with simple targeted solutions than it is to change, you  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:55):**  know, the very foundations of what we've been doing for decades. You know, we said this  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:58):**  already, food systems are inherently complex. And if we just start talking about that percentage  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:03):**  that you were mentioning of how food systems contribute to climate change, there's this  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:06):**  huge variance, because there are these major discrepancies in what people choose to include  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:10):**  in their calculations. I mean, looking perhaps just at that calculation alone, you have to  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:14):**  look at greenhouse gases coming from all the different points in the value chain, you know,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:17):**  from production, which also includes all the energy to produce all the inputs that go into  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:21):**  conventional systems, land use, processing, packaging, distribution, retail, consumption,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:26):**  post consumption, you know, how do you calculate the energy use behind all of those things,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:31):**  and actually properly acquire the data on a global scale to do that it's a huge undertaking,  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:36):**  you know, that's when we're only talking about greenhouse gas emissions. And then you said,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:40):**  you know, we need to think of all the spillover effects, each of those nodes in the food systems  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:43):**  also have beyond greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, biodiversity, communities,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:48):**  food and farm workers, you know, etc, etc. So, again, I think the reason we focus the  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:52):**  declaration on developing integrated food policies is for us to recognize that policies  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:56):**  need to be coherent, they need to be aligned across all these different policy areas to  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:01):**  affect food if we really want to develop real solutions, if you know, if we're only tackling  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:05):**  one aspect of the food system, say, you know, solely reducing carbon emissions related to  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:10):**  production, specifically, we're not looking at issues of packaging or distribution, we're  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:13):**  not even thinking about whether foods we're producing are even healthy, nutritionally,  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:18):**  or contributing to soil and water health. Again, there's going to be a lot of policies  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:21):**  we develop in total contradiction to each other, if we don't look at things coherently,  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:25):**  I think one great example that some of our partners were looking at was that they were  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:29):**  showing that by just looking at diets and food waste as part of national climate plans,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:33):**  we could reduce food systems emissions by a quarter. But again, we're missing out on  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:37):**  all these benefits that we could be leveraging, because we're not looking at issues together.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:41):**  You mentioned, you know, the way in which food systems are complex, and the government's  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:46):**  naturally run scared of them. And when we think about the transport transition, or we  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:49):**  think about the renewables transition, the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables,  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:55):**  there's a degree to which if governments can be successful in inspiring a relatively small  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:00):**  number of people in a relatively small number of boardrooms in a relatively small number  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:04):**  of companies, we can make that transition and we can make it relatively rapidly. Whereas,  
**[0:15:09-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:09):**  you know, when it comes to food systems, I mean, just from the farmer end, we're talking  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:12):**  about hundreds of millions of farmers around the world before we even sort of get to, you  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:17):**  know, the people who are working in processing and retailing and PR and all that sort of  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:21):**  stuff. So, I guess it's not surprising that governments do run scared of this, but we're  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:26):**  at the point now where the low hanging fruit, there are processes in place there, and they've  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:31):**  really got to tackle this, but they've got to tackle it in the right way and not just  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:35):**  decide, right, we're going to go on with food systems. We're going to approach this from  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:38):**  a land sparing perspective. We're going to have more forests. We're going to squeeze  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:42):**  agriculture into ever smaller spaces. They've got to take hold of that complexity.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:47):**  Yeah, they absolutely do. And a lot of the mechanisms for doing that will be through  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:52):**  national food plans. But we think that these local food plans, local integrated food policies  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:57):**  should co-create the national food plans. And that's because some of these, you know,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:03):**  the most complex thing is about changing patterns of habits and behaviours that we have. And  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:07):**  that involves trust. You know, you don't have to change anything to change from a diesel  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:11):**  car to an electric car. If you're going to change what you eat, how much food you waste,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:17):**  you have to change pretty much ingrained habits and patterns of behaviour, which suit you  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:21):**  very well at the moment. That's why you do them. So, you're asking citizens to actually  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:26):**  make personal changes, whereas switching your house from hydrogen gas to hydrogen doesn't  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:33):**  make any difference in how often you put the heating on. You just feel a bit more virtuous  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:36):**  about it. So, I think these are complicated. And that's why the trust that people have  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:39):**  in local government is really important in this process. But I think Chantal is absolutely  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:44):**  right. People do shy away from complexity. And what's interesting in the last five or  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:48):**  ten years is that we've now seen some of those bigger food businesses that you talk about,  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:53):**  some of the multinational corporations, as well as some of the UK retailers in particular,  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:57):**  say this is a big issue. We do have to tackle it systemically. Tesco very recently came  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:01):**  out and said food is 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, 60% biodiversity loss. We have  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:07):**  to step up to the plate on this. So, I think there is a genuine realisation among food  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:11):**  businesses that the business is usually not an option in the food system. I do think national  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:15):**  governments are slower to come to that table. And it's partly because trade policies are  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:19):**  driven by agricultural exports and there's a sort of focus on that. And equally, Chantal  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:24):**  says, if you just focus on carbon, then absolutely it makes sense to have intensive chicken operations  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:30):**  rather than extensive ruminant operations.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:32):**  I want to come back to Chantal on metrics in just a moment, if I may, Pete. But before  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:37):**  we move on to the metrics, I wonder if you have any thoughts about the National Food  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:41):**  Strategy in Britain that was published last year. Because it strikes me that the interface  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:46):**  that you talk about there between local authorities who are already taking action and national  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:51):**  governments. In the UK, there's been a great big national government discussion for the  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:57):**  last five years about food systems, primarily agricultural systems, how food production  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:02):**  impacts the environment. And I wonder how the National Food Strategy handled that relationship  
**[0:18:08-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:08):**  between local authorities and national governments and if you have a view on it.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:11):**  My sense is that we completely missed an opportunity or rather England completely missed an opportunity  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:17):**  to engage local authorities in this conversation. We have a very strong network of food policy  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:21):**  councils, sustainable food cities in the UK. And yet it was absent really from the national  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:26):**  food plan. And I think it would be very helpful for local authorities collectively in England  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:31):**  to make a much stronger case when the white paper comes out for co-producing a national  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:35):**  food plan. And it is because local authorities can sell some of these things to their own  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:40):**  populations and get citizen support for them in a different way from national governments.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:44):**  A lot of the pressure behind the sugar tax, the soda tax in the UK could only happen because  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:49):**  of a lot of citizen pressure on that, trying to push for that to happen. And similarly,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:54):**  proposals in the national food plan for a broader sugar tax will only come about, I  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:58):**  think, if there's bottom up pressure from local authorities and health boards saying  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:03):**  this would be such a huge benefit to public health. We want really to see it happen.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:07):**  Yeah, I just wanted to add to that because I think Pete said something really relevant  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:10):**  is that we want to support local authorities and really being able to co-develop any national  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:15):**  food strategies and commitments that will be developed, not just to tackle climate change,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:19):**  but just anything. Because I think something Pete said really eloquently recently was that  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:23):**  we don't just want local authorities to be implementers of these top down strategies  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:26):**  determined at the federal level. We really want them to be included in the process. And  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:30):**  that's certainly part of the reforms that need to take place. But we know that local  
**[0:19:34-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:34):**  authorities are closer to their citizens. They're more responsive. They listen more.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:38):**  Going back to this issue of marginalized groups, I mean, we have tons of signatories from the  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:41):**  declaration, again, New Haven, Philadelphia, et cetera, who've been having these really  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:45):**  extensive consultations and collaborations with some of these groups in multiple languages,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:50):**  listening to their concerns, just to make sure that they are part of the decision making.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:54):**  And that's something that we don't necessarily find as easily or as readily available at  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:59):**  the national level. And it's really something that they could learn from when discussing  
**[0:20:03-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:03):**  with local authorities.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:04):**  The New Haven. So you looking at the potential for working with local authorities, for example,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:08):**  as case studies in particular countries to help develop a national food plan or an international  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:14):**  approach to localized food delivery?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:17):**  I think it's probably at two levels that we see these things working. Three levels, possibly.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:22):**  At the city local authority level, as we mentioned earlier, there's lots of really practical  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:26):**  things that governments can do, local governments can do to influence the food system and to  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:30):**  reduce emissions and to make people healthier. I think then at the national level, we would  
**[0:20:35-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:35):**  certainly encourage a situation where local authorities of all shapes and sizes are involved  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:39):**  in developing those national food plans. And indeed, the plans at the supranational level  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:43):**  at the EU, for example, it's really important that cities and regions play a part in developing  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:47):**  that too.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:48):**  But then I think at the global level, you know, we've been working with the local government  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:51):**  constituency to make sure that the voices of cities and regions are heard at future  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:57):**  international events, because they need to be at the table on that because otherwise  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:01):**  there's a real danger that the conversation about food systems, you know, is simply dominated  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:06):**  by national governments, and to some extent by the commercial interests that also, you  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:10):**  know, play into those discussions, but that we continue to have a focus primarily on production  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:16):**  and exports, rather than a whole food systems approach. And I think what local governments  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:21):**  can bring to that is a much more rounded, you know, what will benefit our people approach.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:26):**  It strikes me that actually this is not entirely dissimilar to the conversation that we were  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:30):**  having around indigenous populations around the world, that they were feeling that they  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:35):**  were excluded from the COP processes, looking at food systems in the same way that they  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:39):**  need to be brought in. We need local authorities, a whole range of different sort of smaller  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:44):**  stakeholders from around the world to inform that process. It's really interesting. I'm  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:48):**  going to move on thinking further around that variance between assessments of global warming  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:53):**  impact on food systems. Isn't it the case that emissions aren't always the best metric  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:58):**  anyway, particularly when we're looking at food production from agroecological farms,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:03):**  and that we need to move away from this single issue sort of approach to the food system  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:07):**  and food system reform, acknowledge that complexity and assess impacts locally rather than globally?  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:12):**  Yes, absolutely. And I think that was one of the places I was hoping the conversation  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:16):**  would go next. Because, you know, as we said before, it's quite overwhelming to tackle  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:20):**  things holistically from a policy perspective, because, you know, again, it's just not the  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:24):**  way we've ever designed our governance institutions to handle these issues. And I think on top  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:28):**  of that, you then add this COP environment in which we've built commitments around, you  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:32):**  know, focusing on singular metrics to demonstrate results, you know, be they carbon emissions  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:36):**  or otherwise. But I think what's really important to take note of is that the solutions to actually  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:40):**  take this more integrated assessment approach are out there, including at the local level.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:44):**  You know, we're seeing authorities working with whether it's researchers or groups working  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:48):**  on the ground, to develop these very sophisticated metrics and indicators to measure the breadth  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:53):**  of impacts of food systems, you know, not just on climate and emissions, but on natural  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:58):**  resource use on biodiversity, on nutrition on access, and all of these other areas that  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:03):**  we've already mentioned. So again, we actually already have the tools to develop comprehensive  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:07):**  strategies and the methods or the metrics, sorry, to back up their implementation. If  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:12):**  for me, again, it just takes the willingness to tackle these complexities head on, and  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:15):**  to stop working in these silos where we each have our own limited set of metrics working  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:20):**  on our little piece of the problem.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:21):**  Jason Vale, PhD Or indeed limited sets of knowledge.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:23):**  Anna Tsing, PhD Sure. Yes, exactly. And I think, as you said,  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:26):**  agro-ecological systems just really do this beautifully and break away all of these different  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:31):**  silos we just mentioned, including the knowledge one, you know, because again, these are systems  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:34):**  that are based on a holistic paradigm that considers the entirety of the food systems  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:40):**  and their effects not just on the environment, but as we said, on people, on communities,  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:43):**  and even honestly, on the very economic systems that are underpinning how we distribute and  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:48):**  consume our food. And I think in these systems, too, communities have developed impact assessment  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:52):**  tools to show both not just the quantitative but also the qualitative benefits that these  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:57):**  systems have, because we often forget about those the qualitative benefits. And what's  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:00):**  great to see is that these these assessment tools are really being picked up by international  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:04):**  institutions like the FAO, like IFAD, who are starting to recognize these, I don't like  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:09):**  the word, but these co-benefits of agro-ecological systems. And again, these more comprehensive  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:13):**  tools that we need to assess them. So I really hope that, you know, we're starting to recognize  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:17):**  this and we'll see progress on that front in the coming years.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:19):**  Mason It does seem like there is progress around  
**[0:24:21-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:21):**  that recognition of the importance of agro-ecological systems. And I wonder, Chantal, you asked  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:25):**  me to chair the session that I chaired at COP26 for IPES Food and the World Economic  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:31):**  Forum, various other different stakeholders there. And when we were talking before the  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:35):**  event with policy officers within those organizations, I asked the question, you know, is there a  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:39):**  consensus around things like agro-ecology? And the answer was, no, don't think so. A  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:45):**  consensus even between things like land sharing and land sparing. And actually, there did  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:48):**  seem to be amongst the senior people on the panel there, I mean, as Vice President for  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:54):**  Sustainability for the World Bank, for example, you know, talking about agro-ecology in a  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:58):**  way that was perhaps unexpected. And I wonder, were you surprised by the level of consensus  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:03):**  that there actually was around agro-ecology? Chantal Both surprised by the consensus and  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:07):**  surprised by the lack of consensus all at the same time. And I think the main question  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:11):**  there is to ask consensus amongst whom, right? Because for me, there's millions of voices  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:16):**  on the ground, farmers, indigenous communities, local authorities, etc., etc., you know, groups,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:22):**  civil society groups, that do agree that agro-ecology is the way forward. But where I was seeing  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:27):**  consensus amongst perhaps higher level decision makers was that agro-ecology, if you boil  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:32):**  it down to what it really is, can really serve as this umbrella term that, you know, I think  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:37):**  hosts a whole set of practices that we are actually using right now that we don't call  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:42):**  agro-ecology, organic agriculture, permaculture, you know, even some aspects of regenerative  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:46):**  agriculture, all of these things are inherently agro-ecological. The thing that agro-ecology  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:51):**  does is really just to broaden the umbrella of what you know, of what these things mean.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:55):**  And of course, not just to look at agricultural production issues, but to look at, as I said,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:59):**  the social benefits, the economic complexities of the problem, and all of these other different  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:03):**  areas that we often try to sideline because they're more complicated to look at.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:07):**  We've talked a lot about the environment. We've talked a bit about, you know, where  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:11):**  change needs to come from. Pete, COVID-19 is also a key theme in the Glasgow Food and  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:16):**  Climate Declaration, which says that Coronavirus has exposed the fragility of our food systems  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:21):**  and the vulnerabilities of large parts of our urban and rural populations. How do we  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:27):**  go about delivering preparedness and resilience to future pandemics for our communities?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:33):**  Well, I think a starting point is nutrition equity. You know, it's in the Global Nutrition  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:38):**  Report, this idea that we need to reduce inequity in the levels of nutrition in our population  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:43):**  is as important, it seems to me, in Scotland as it is in many parts of the world. We have  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:47):**  a two-tier food system. And that goes back, you know, centuries, certainly decades, you  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:52):**  know, where people who have more ability to spend money on food are actually able to nourish  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:57):**  themselves much better. And that's fundamentally unfair, you know, because it impacts on people's  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:01):**  quality of life, but also on their life expectancy, where we've just taken for granted that we  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:06):**  have a universal NHS provision, universal education provision in the UK and most, you  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:11):**  know, most countries in Europe that we somehow seem to tolerate massive inequities in access  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:16):**  to food as being just something we can't really do anything much about. And I think that one  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:21):**  of the things about getting very prepared for a future pandemic is having a healthier  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:26):**  population. You know, if we invested anything like the amount that we've had to invest in  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:31):**  response to pandemic in reducing, for example, you know, the chronic epidemic of diabetes  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:37):**  and other food, diet-related diseases by creating a healthier population through food, if we  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:43):**  got food to do the heavy lifting in health, as John Boydwell recommended 80 years ago,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:48):**  then actually that would be the one most important thing we could do to be prepared. I do think  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:53):**  there's another thing which we learned from COVID-19, which was that local food systems  
**[0:27:57-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:57):**  sprang into action, not just in Scotland, but all over the world. You know, a friend  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:01):**  of ours who mills wheat, you know, was working 24-hour shifts to mill enough wheat so people  
**[0:28:06-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:06):**  could go and make their own bread. And then of course, once COVID ends or the lockdown  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:10):**  ends, you know, he's back to normal shifts and he's got a bit of money in the bank, but  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:13):**  he's still back to where he was. But if we seriously want to have something like an 80-20  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:18):**  system where at least 20% of the food can be sourced locally so that, you know, we're  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:24):**  not dependent on one supply chain for that, it does give us a little bit of resilience  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:28):**  in the system. It doesn't mean we have to sort of shut all the doors and go to 100%.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:32):**  We don't want any import system, which would be crazy, but we can go to a system which  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:35):**  is better balanced, I think, between a resilient local food economy and the global supply chains,  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:41):**  which we've all come to depend on.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:42):**  I wonder the extent to which communities, particularly poorer communities, were more  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:47):**  resilient in the past. And I'm thinking back to my time living outside Glasgow, talking  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:53):**  to people inside Glasgow about the way that poorer areas, perhaps the slums in Glasgow,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:58):**  as they would have been in the 50s and the 60s, the way in which those communities had  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:04):**  much greater access to immediate fruit and veg because they were on barrows, they were  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:10):**  on stalls that were in the streets there. And that actually the nutritional availability  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:15):**  was better in those days in some ways than it is now where people, you know, are going  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:19):**  into supermarkets, going for the buy one, get one freeze, which are often on more processed  
**[0:29:25-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:25):**  products. Do you have a sense of the history around that, Pete?  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:27):**  Well, certainly, I mean, you go back to 19th century, fruit and veg were highly unavailable  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:31):**  in Glasgow and Dundee, and that contributed to some of the sort of dietary patterns, the  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:35):**  health patterns that we've seen because people were so weaved out of their rural existences  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:39):**  and plonked in the cities at huge densities. And actually there was real access problems  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:44):**  to fruit and veg. I think you're right, probably in the post-war period, some of that improved  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:48):**  and that people could get access to those things. But there's always that question of  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:51):**  income and what income people can spend on fruit and veg. But these are the stuff of,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:57):**  if you like, local food policies. Glasgow's actively looking at how do we increase the  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:02):**  availability of fruit and veg to people in low income communities, but also how do we  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:06):**  increase the production of that within the city walls? Glasgow's blessed with a huge  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:10):**  amount of green space and is now actively looking at converting not just the odd street  
**[0:30:15-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:15):**  corner but significant chunks of the real estate into food growing enterprises that  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:21):**  have a commercial activity. Dundee recently recognised they could produce at least a third  
**[0:30:26-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:26):**  of all the fruit and veg requirements for the city on land within the city walls. And  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:30):**  that's something which has gone out of fashion in the UK, but is seen as completely part  
**[0:30:35-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:35):**  of how we do business in other cities that are signed the Glasgow Declaration.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:38):**  Again, it's exciting to hear what you're talking about there with local authorities and city-wide  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:44):**  strategies and the way that they're focusing on nutrition for poorer populations, for the  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:49):**  population at large. But I'm still sort of going back to the coronavirus response and  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:55):**  what we've learned from coronavirus. And it seems to me that many national governments,  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:59):**  certainly our own in London, seem to have seen the response to the COVID crisis as evidence  
**[0:31:05-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:05):**  that the current model of transnational commodity trading, with big retailers using their logistical  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:11):**  and financial strength to get affordable food to people in times of need, is a sign that  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:16):**  actually the global food system is working.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:18):**  I think we were incredibly lucky. You know, we were very lucky that countries kept their  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:22):**  borders open. They didn't in 2008. And that's why we had the food price spike and a massive  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:27):**  increase in global hunger following the food price spike. You know, to that extent, international  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:31):**  deployment and international relations held and people kept the borders open. And the  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:35):**  supply chain is free. The supply chain is frayed significantly. They didn't break this  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:39):**  time. That doesn't mean that they're never going to break. And it doesn't mean that,  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:43):**  you know, you're not going to get, if you've got similar situation plus, you know, greater  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:48):**  international tensions, you could have, you know, a crisis. And as everybody said, in  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:52):**  the UK, that's within nine meals. You know, that's, we've had these very just in time  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:56):**  supply chains. And so it doesn't take a huge amount. And to go from, you know, to go from  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:01):**  being okay to panic is just a few hours. And I think that's the really scary thing we have  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:06):**  to understand. I don't expect we're likely to move in the short term to massive intervention  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:12):**  stocks, you know, go back to those days. But I do think this question that for every country  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:16):**  has to ask itself is, how can it meet the nutritional needs of its own population within  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:21):**  its own land and sea resources? And what we do know is that the UK as a whole doesn't  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:26):**  do a very good job of that, you know, and if part of that means farming differently,  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:30):**  shifting diets, reducing waste, using our seas better, whatever it is, but I think it,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:36):**  you know, for every country, you know, we have to think, what is our impact on climate  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:40):**  and nature through our food system, the food we consume, and how could we do more to reduce  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:45):**  that? And part of that is producing more of what we eat and eating more of what we produce.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:49):**  And I think there's a good argument to say, if we get into a world which is less cooperative,  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:53):**  then being able to rely on food imports from from other places in the world is something  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:57):**  we should be, you know, more prepared in the eventuality that we can't. But I think on  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:02):**  top of that, you're right, that we'll continue to see an escalation in climate related natural  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:08):**  events that impact on food production. The biggest thing in many ways is, you know, that  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:13):**  the way that we're eating into nature, the way that the food system is eating its own  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:18):**  means of production could precipitate, you know, quite dramatic shifts in in a system  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:23):**  that we don't actually understand very well, you know, the collapse of insect populations  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:27):**  is something which keeps me awake at night, because it could be it could ripple out from  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:32):**  individual areas much more widely.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:34):**  We're absolutely going to see that I think we've all said it at this point, but you know,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:38):**  these extreme weather events mixed with political instability in some areas, mixed with I think  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:43):**  just climate change, generally speaking, is going to lead to a whole host of new vulnerabilities.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:47):**  We have documented that there will be more migration, more displacement. So everything  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:51):**  is I think, going to the term that I have in my head right now is not appropriate. But  
**[0:33:56-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:56):**  when things will get difficult, it's  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:58):**  You're gonna say when the shit hits the fan.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:00):**  I was I was exactly.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:02):**  You can say that.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:03):**  But I think, you know, we've already seen just with a singular pandemic, we saw the  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:08):**  shelves empty out in a lot of, you know, places around the world, we saw what happens, people  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:12):**  start panicking when one singular ship gets stuck in a canal. So you know, we know that  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:16):**  these things are on the horizon. And when those things multiply, things will certainly  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:19):**  get worse. And if I can just go back to the COVID measures for one moment, I heard a really  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:24):**  important story in terms of the practical applications of how things get difficult during  
**[0:34:28-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:28):**  the pandemic. I think a lot of us are a bit removed from that. But I was speaking to a  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:31):**  partner in West Africa who was saying that during the pandemic, trucks weren't allowed  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:35):**  to drive at night. So that meant that for food to be distributed, they had to drive  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:39):**  during the day. So there was a backlog of trucks on the highways overnight food was  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:43):**  rotting from the field because it couldn't be distributed because it's usually transported  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:46):**  at night. Farmers couldn't supply their markets. There's all these things that we just don't  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:50):**  see when we purchase food at a supermarket that we don't know that they're happening.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:54):**  And that, you know, when you put measures in place to deal with a pandemic or other  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:58):**  issues, again, the multiplier effect is huge in terms of how that impacts the food system,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:02):**  farmers, food suppliers, and again, the whole chain. It's massive.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:06):**  The Declaration talks also about inequalities and talks about the way in which the food  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:13):**  system as it stands today is an accelerant of greater inequality for people already living  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:18):**  in poverty or experiencing racism or who are displaced already due to conflict and climate  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:23):**  change. And in what way are these vulnerable communities impacted by the current food system?  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:29):**  Sure. And that's a great question that no one likes the answer to. And it's because  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:33):**  the dominant food systems that we have right now are essentially based on a history of  
**[0:35:36-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:36):**  exploitation. Exploitation of people, particularly food and farm workers, of women, of indigenous  
**[0:35:42-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:42):**  communities, of communities of colour. And it's not just people, you know, exploitation  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:45):**  of natural resources, of rural spaces, again, all with the aim to produce the largest quantity  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:50):**  of food at the cheapest price that has its benefits. But, you know, to what to what end?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:54):**  And I think this has affected people's access to land and natural resources, to their right  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:58):**  to diversified diets, just to the security of their livelihoods. And, you know, often  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:02):**  just their access to very basic human rights, you know, just to live a healthy and dignified  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:06):**  life. And so, again, as we've been saying, climate change is going to act as a multiplier  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:10):**  of these injustices because it just makes our systems and our society so much more vulnerable  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:15):**  and unpredictable. And as I said before, on top of that, we add political instability  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:19):**  or conflict in certain areas that will inevitably worsen existing poverty, food insecurity and  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:24):**  again access to kind of basic things. And I think we've seen studies that show that  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:28):**  the number of people who are undernourished has actually increased over the past decade.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:32):**  COVID has worsened that, of course, but that the numbers are really concentrated in regions  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:36):**  that have been facing both extreme weather events and conflicts where, you know, landscapes  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:41):**  are changing, they're unstable, there's displacement, biodiversity has plummeted. So really, again,  
**[0:36:46-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:46):**  just this multiplier effect when you mix multiple conflicts and issues at the same time. And  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:50):**  I think just to add one thing is that these aren't just problems that are happening in  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:54):**  areas of political conflict and instability. There was this great piece of research I saw  
**[0:36:58-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:58):**  in the US recently that was looking at the impacts of climate change on communities that  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:03):**  face higher instances of comorbidities. So things like obesity, diabetes, other health  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:07):**  conditions. And firstly, they showed that communities of color were facing much higher  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:11):**  risks of comorbidities due to just structural inequalities, like lack of access to health  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:15):**  care and other crucial resources just like unhealthy food environments, lack of green  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:19):**  spaces in urban areas, etc. And that climate change, especially through things like heatwaves  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:23):**  or other extreme weather events, was exacerbating these health conditions because again, when  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:28):**  communities are lacking health services, basic infrastructure, that they've been pushed historically  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:32):**  into areas with just higher air pollution during heatwaves that worsen. These are just  
**[0:37:37-0:37:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:37):**  a few examples of how all of these things just coalesce in these moments of crisis and  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:41):**  just make things worse for the people who are already the worst off.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:44):**  And when we tend to think of crisis, we tend to think of something that's emerged that  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:47):**  we weren't expecting. But what you're setting out there is an overview, a sort of a bird's  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:53):**  eye view of a whole range of different issues which are already present, which we can already  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:59):**  see. And even if they, you know, many of them might be concentrated in poorer nations or  
**[0:38:05-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:05):**  in the global south, they are already starting to impact in the richer nations in the north  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:10):**  of the globe. And these issues around security, around public security, of course, are things  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:15):**  that we were starting to bring out in the solar report that you contributed to as well  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:20):**  for the Food and Global Security Network. But the point is that we can see these things  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:25):**  happening. There are these little fires burning. And if we don't recognise and treat these  
**[0:38:30-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:30):**  little fires and look at solutions like agroecology, we're just going to see a cascading of them.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:35):**  And we're going to see a rise in the future.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:36):**  Chantelle, these issues are things that the UN Sustainable Development Goals are trying  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:40):**  to address. How do you think a food systems lens in and of itself can help deliver progress  
**[0:38:45-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:45):**  on the SDGs?  
**[0:38:46-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:46):**  Chantelle Léonard-Rice, Global Development Goals Director, Food and Global Security Network  
**[0:38:47-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:47):**  I hope this has become old news at this point because I've been hearing it for I think about  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:50):**  a decade now. But we know that food systems are crucial to meeting the SDGs because food,  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:55):**  unlike anything else, I think just touches on every single one of them. And just to give  
**[0:38:59-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:59):**  a few examples, you know, looking at the SDG on poverty, and we've talked about poverty  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:02):**  a bit already. You know, creating genuinely sustainable food system fights poverty because  
**[0:39:07-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:07):**  you're creating good jobs, you're improving access to food, you're supporting healthy  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:11):**  communities to be healthy, more self-sufficient, more resilient. If we're looking at SDG3 on  
**[0:39:16-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:16):**  good health and well-being, obviously healthy diversified food systems really help to meet  
**[0:39:21-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:21):**  that goal. Going back to agroecological systems, I think one great example I've heard recently  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:25):**  as well, is just to see that through diversified systems, communities who would traditionally  
**[0:39:30-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:30):**  experience these lean months, so months where communities go for months without food when  
**[0:39:34-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:34):**  you're in between harvests, by diversifying production of nutritious foods, you then have  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:38):**  food all year round because you've diversified, you can stagger your yields, your crops and  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:42):**  your harvests. And it just makes communities more again, self-sufficient, self-reliant,  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:46):**  and then just healthy. And then expanding because people always look at the food SDGs.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:50):**  But if you take SDG5 on gender equality, if you're again, sustainable food systems can  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:54):**  create the infrastructure for women to have access to land to credit to the resources  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:59):**  they need to support their livelihoods. And then even going more out there, SDG, I think  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:04):**  16 on peace and strong institutions. Again, we know that sustainable food systems need  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:09):**  to be supported by sound governance mechanisms through participation, through inclusivity.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:13):**  Again, at the local level, we're seeing this happen a bit better because we have these  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:17):**  collaborative schemes between residents and municipal authorities, whether it's food policy  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:21):**  councils or similar bodies. And again, sustainable food systems can be underpinned and can build  
**[0:40:26-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:26):**  just strong governance structures. So again, you know, I could keep going on, the list  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:30):**  goes on and on, but every SDG is related. But of course, we can only meet these in so  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:35):**  far as governments are willing to do this difficult structural work to tie things together,  
**[0:40:40-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:40):**  to look at food systems in an integrated way. But again, I think we've said that so many  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:43):**  times now that hopefully that message is clear.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:45):**  Pete, look, these are great big issues that many people would expect national governments  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:50):**  and international processes to take action on. But the Glasgow declarations targeted  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:55):**  sub-national governments and local authorities, as we've been discussing. Do you think that  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:00):**  smaller authorities are inherently better able to address these issues? And I wonder  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:04):**  what the balance is between the actions that should be taken at national and international  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:09):**  level and the actions should be taken at local level?  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:12):**  Well, yes, they do. I think they're better at joining up the system. And that's because  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:15):**  I think they're better at understanding what the purpose of the food system is. The implicit  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:19):**  purpose of the food system, particularly since the war, the global food system, has been  
**[0:41:23-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:23):**  produce and sell. And we've had this feed the world narrative that justifies all sorts  
**[0:41:27-0:41:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:27):**  of things in the name of we need to increase production, we need to sell more food. And  
**[0:41:31-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:31):**  you've got a food system which fundamentally underdelivers on what most people think its  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:37):**  goal should be, like nourishing everybody. You know, when we've got 10% of the world's  
**[0:41:41-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:41):**  population not having enough calories to get by and experiencing severe hunger, and 20%  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:47):**  of the world's population eating too much of the wrong stuff and dying young, you know,  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:52):**  and then all the externalities trashing nature and warming the climate, you know, it's a  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:56):**  system which at global level fails to do what ordinary people would think it was there for.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:01):**  And I think that idea about, you know, if you're in Bristol, what should our food system  
**[0:42:05-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:05):**  do? Well, it should make sure that everybody can eat well, without impacting negatively  
**[0:42:10-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:10):**  on nature and climate while restoring nature and cooling the climate. That's a common sense  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:14):**  understanding what food systems are about. And that can be understood at a local level  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:18):**  quite clearly and held on to. And I think then that different narrative, I think has  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:22):**  to, as we said, go up international governments to make a much clearer argument of what food  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:27):**  system is about and what it's trying to do. The change that we're looking for, the transformation  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:31):**  we're looking for with Next Generation is significant, it's wide ranging, but it will  
**[0:42:35-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:35):**  be experienced locally, it will be experienced by producers on the ground, by food businesses,  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:41):**  and by citizens changing their food practices, experiencing food differently. But hopefully,  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:46):**  just as with the other changes we want to see as a result of tackling climate change,  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:50):**  people come out of that with a much better relationship with food, a much more equal  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:54):**  relationship with food, with better jobs in food that are properly paid and secure, you  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:59):**  know, with a food system that works for everyone, you know, there's a much brighter possibility  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:03):**  in the food system. And I think quite often, you can get stronger glimpses of that at local  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:08):**  level, you know, the little city of Mont-Sartout in France, you know, just goes, we're going  
**[0:43:12-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:12):**  to 100% organic in our school food, let's just do it. You know, you can get glimpses  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:17):**  of change at the local level, which is sometimes harder to see at the national level.  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:21):**  — So how do we drive this? How do we make this happen? And we're coming to the end of  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:26):**  the programme, so I guess bringing us back to, you know, where we started with the Glasgow  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:31):**  Food and Climate Declaration, it had an objective, you've been getting signatories to that over  
**[0:43:37-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:37):**  the course of the last year. What's next? Is there a way that this declaration and a  
**[0:43:42-0:43:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:42):**  response to it can help to get national governments to cede some of the power that no national  
**[0:43:47-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:47):**  government likes to cede to local authorities to start building up this plan of action?  
**[0:43:53-0:43:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:53):**  — Absolutely. I think really the conversation on food at the climate COP has really only  
**[0:43:57-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:57):**  just begun. And I think if we're going to truly build sustainable food systems, again,  
**[0:44:01-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:01):**  ones that are based on justice, equity, resilience, diversity, we need to be having a completely  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:06):**  different and expanded conversation on how food systems are part of the solution. And,  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:10):**  you know, we haven't quite had a chance to talk about power. But from what I saw, you  
**[0:44:14-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:14):**  know, I really think the climate COP may be becoming the next sort of global battleground  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:19):**  to determine the future of our food systems. And I really think the Glasgow Food and Climate  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:23):**  Declaration will continue to play a role, not just in amplifying the voices of local  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:27):**  communities and global debates, but also, again, as the strong reminder to decision  
**[0:44:31-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:31):**  makers that they need to be accountable to their citizens, they need to be accountable  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:34):**  to local level actors, and those actually making our food systems function on a day  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:38):**  to day. I think local authorities have recognized that. So for me, it's really time that we  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:43):**  keep amplifying those voices and global debates. You know, as we look forward to COP 27 already,  
**[0:44:48-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:48):**  the Glasgow Declaration, we're really hoping to grow out our list of signatories, because  
**[0:44:51-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:51):**  we talked about a whole group of actors during this conversation that need to be included.  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:56):**  So more communities, more cities, more states and regions, tribal nations, indigenous communities.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:01):**  I think we've already been doing this since the start of COP 26. But we also want to share  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:05):**  just more stories of success. We talked about, you know, little fires burning everywhere.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:09):**  But I think there's also, as Pete just said, glimmers of hope also happening everywhere.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:13):**  And so through I think these case where we've been publishing short case studies on the  
**[0:45:17-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:17):**  Glasgow Declaration website, just to really give people concrete examples of the changes  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:21):**  that are happening, and not just the practical changes, but also, again, these very important  
**[0:45:25-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:25):**  governance mechanisms that have to be put in place to make these things happen. So I  
**[0:45:29-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:29):**  think moving forward, you know, there's of course, the implementation piece because cities  
**[0:45:32-0:45:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:32):**  will continue to do the good work on the ground through various means. But we absolutely have  
**[0:45:36-0:45:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:36):**  to continue carrying this political message to COP 27, that food and local level action  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:42):**  are crucial to curb the climate crisis, especially, you know, when those actions can be inclusive  
**[0:45:46-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:46):**  and participatory and comprehensive.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:48):**  Fantastic. Pete, I'm looking for a prediction just to take us to the end of the programme.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:53):**  Which COPs are it going to be when food systems finally make it to the top table? Is it going  
**[0:45:58-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:58):**  to be COP 27?  
**[0:45:59-0:46:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:59):**  I think that's undeniable it's going to be COP 27. We've already heard from the Egyptian  
**[0:46:03-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:03):**  Environment Minister that she sees COP 27 having food at its heart. But as Chantal says,  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:09):**  that's a great first start. But the question is, how do we frame that debate so that it's  
**[0:46:15-0:46:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:15):**  not about technical fixes? You know, one of the criticisms we had at the UN Food Systems  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:19):**  Summit that was too early on, it got into this idea that what we need is some more technical  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:24):**  fixes and that if we can find ways of producing more, more cheaply or whatever, that will  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:28):**  fix the problem. It's, as Chantal says, it's a question of power, it's a question of purpose,  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:34):**  it's a question of will, and it's a question of policymakers being able to embrace some  
**[0:46:38-0:46:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:38):**  of the complexity involved in helping to transform our food systems. If COP 27, the Glasgow Declaration  
**[0:46:44-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:44):**  and other initiatives can help to get the voices, local communities and cities and citizens  
**[0:46:49-0:46:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:49):**  to that table to make a clear case of the sort of food system they want, which suits  
**[0:46:54-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:54):**  their culture, their land, their sea, you know, their communities, their practices,  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:59):**  and not, you know, how do we fix this for the world from the top down? I think if we  
**[0:47:03-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:03):**  can get that sort of conversation, how can the world's rules and architecture help local  
**[0:47:09-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:09):**  food systems to flourish and to serve their people and to conserve nature? That's the  
**[0:47:14-0:47:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:14):**  question we need to be asking and to try to get away from this idea that we can simply  
**[0:47:20-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:20):**  have a top down fix based on the current patterns of exploitation, externalities and exploitation  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:28):**  of animals, as well as soils and water and nature. We need a different conversation once  
**[0:47:34-0:47:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:34):**  we get it on the agenda. You're actually right. First job, get it on the agenda. Second job,  
**[0:47:38-0:47:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:38):**  frame the conversation so we talk about the right things.  
**[0:47:41-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:41):**  Thanks, Pete. That's been such an interesting conversation, but that's all we've got time  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:47:44):**  for. I'd like to thank my guests, Chantelle Clément from iPESS Food and Pete Ritchie

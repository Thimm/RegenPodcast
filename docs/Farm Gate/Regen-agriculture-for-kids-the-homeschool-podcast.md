### Farm Gate  (Mon, 11 May 2020 11:00:17)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, I'm Finnlow Kustain and welcome to a rather different Farmgate podcast. Today  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:11):**  we're going all homeschool to try and explain a bit about regenerative agriculture for primary  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:17):**  school-aged kids. So if you're about eight years old, a bit younger, a bit older, then  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:22):**  this program's for you. If you're an adult, then I'm afraid it's time to leave. Go  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:27):**  on. That means you. Off you go.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:32):**  OK, now the oldies are out of the room, let's get on with the program. Regenerative agriculture  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:41):**  is a new way of farming. It focuses really hard on the soil, keeping it healthy, keeping  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:47):**  it covered, keeping it spongy, so it manages water really well, and making sure that it's  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:53):**  always bursting with life. Regenerative agriculture is about working with nature to harness the  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:00:59):**  power of the sunlight and the virtue of the rain, and trying to encourage loads of different  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:04):**  plants and animals into the farm system so that the land is alive and thriving, bursting  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:10):**  with life. In this program, I'll be joined by the brilliant Alex Tomlinson, an absolutely  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:15):**  amazing mine of information. She'll be answering questions about the sun, the rain, dandelions  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:21):**  and cow poo, and I'll try and pin her down on what's the most important animal in the  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:27):**  world.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:28):**  Hi Alex, thanks for joining me. What I wonder is if you could just tell us all who you are,  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:37):**  and the all-important question, are you a teacher?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:39):**  No, first of all, no, I'm not a teacher. I'm actually a vet, and I have a background  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:44):**  in studying wildlife health and disease and conservation work.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:49):**  Okay, so could you tell me, just to start us off, what in a nutshell is regenerative  
**[0:01:56-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:56):**  agriculture?  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:01:57):**  Regenerative agriculture is about rethinking the way we produce food from our land. It  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:04):**  is essentially a redesign of our food production systems, focusing on rebooting the functionality  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:10):**  of an ecosystem, which we've largely lost.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:13):**  Brilliant. Now, we've got some questions that have been sent in ahead of time by children  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:18):**  from primary school, and I wonder if you could help us to answer them. Is that okay?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:22):**  Yeah, yeah, I'll do my best.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:30):**  How does the sun make food?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:33):**  So this is a really interesting question, and it is about the ability of plants to make  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:42):**  their own food, which we don't have. We have to eat food. Plants are extraordinary. They  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:48):**  can use light from the sun, carbon dioxide from the air, and water from the ground, and  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:54):**  combine those together using the energy of the sun to make glucose and oxygen.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:02:59):**  Now, is this that process that's called photosynthesis?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:02):**  It is.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:03):**  It's a big word, and it basically means making food, making sugars from the sunlight.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:07):**  Yes, which is actually quite remarkable.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:10):**  So that's amazing. So that's kind of what you're saying, is that the plants are like  
**[0:03:14-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:14):**  farmers themselves.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:16):**  Yes, and even better is that they are using something that's free to make food. The sugar  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:23):**  is their sort of energy source, if you like, so it enables them to grow and also to put  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:29):**  energy into their defences. So it's a building block. So it enables a plant to grow more  
**[0:03:36-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:36):**  leaves and grow more roots and get taller.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:38):**  So when you say building block, do you mean like Lego? That these are different cells  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:43):**  that are building up to make that whole plant, and that plant could be an enormous oak tree,  
**[0:03:48-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:48):**  or it could be something as simple as grass?  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:50):**  Absolutely, yes. I mean, each plant will have its own DNA, which will direct how it grows  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:56):**  and what it grows into.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:03:57):**  And when you say DNA, that's kind of like a set of instructions like you get with Lego,  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:03):**  a set of instructions for building your own body structure.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:06):**  Yeah, it is. Yeah. So it's like a sort of a recipe almost that directs what gets built  
**[0:04:13-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:13):**  and how the plant grows and what it grows into.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:16):**  Do farmers have to water the fields?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:22):**  So thankfully, in this country, mostly not, because we have a climate where it rains throughout  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:27):**  the year. When rain falls on bare ground, the water can run off the surface or it can  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:33):**  evaporate very quickly. If you've got a really nice field full of lots of grasses and broad-leaved  
**[0:04:39-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:39):**  plants, then when the rain hits those, it slowly trickles down and reaches the soil  
**[0:04:45-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:45):**  surface much more slowly than if there was nothing growing. So that's the first thing  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:49):**  that's quite important. And the second thing is that if you've got that picture of lots  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:54):**  of different plants growing at lots of different heights, what you see above the ground is  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:04:59):**  sort of mirrored by what's going on under the ground. So underneath the ground, there's  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:04):**  also lots of roots going down to different depths and reaching out in different directions.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:11):**  And there's lots of biology going on under the ground as well, basically life. So that  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:16):**  would be lots of bacteria, lots of fungi, lots of things that eat those. So invertebrates,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:23):**  worms, beetles, and mites, and all sorts of living creatures and critters. And they're  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:29):**  all actually helping each other. I mean, some of them might not see it like that because  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:33):**  it might involve them being eaten. But indirectly, they're all working together to create this  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:39):**  lovely rich soil that has lots of little pockets of air in it.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:44):**  The health of the soil is one of the really key elements of regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:48):**  isn't it? And we talk about the soil carbon sponge. What does that mean?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:53):**  The soil carbon sponge is when you have a really healthy soil, it will have a lot of  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:05:58):**  what we call organic matter, this life. And within that, you've got lots of air pockets,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:04):**  and you've got lots of little clusters of material. And that all enables when the water  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:10):**  comes through, it all enables the water to literally be like what happens when you have  
**[0:06:15-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:15):**  a sponge so it can hold the water. It's really important for the plants, otherwise they can't  
**[0:06:19-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:19):**  photosynthesize, they need the water to grow.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:27):**  Are things like dandelions, dock leaves and nettles weeds?  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:31):**  Okay, great question. No, they're not. In regenerative agriculture, we start to look  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:37):**  at things in a different way. And if something is growing somewhere, it's telling us something  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:43):**  about the environment in which it's growing. So every plant has a set of conditions, a  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:49):**  set of needs, if you like. If a dandelion is growing, then that tells me that that soil  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:06:54):**  is well set up for dandelions. And that's usually quite poor soil. So if you look at  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:00):**  paths, sometimes you might see dandelions coming up out of out of nothing. They've got  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:04):**  these really long tap roots if you've ever dug one up, and they can go right down and  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:08):**  source nutrients that way.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:10):**  And the dandelions have a function, don't they? When those tap roots are going down,  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:15):**  they're actually helping to take that soil which has become poorer quality, perhaps because  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:20):**  it's been walked on too much or driven over too much. And it helps to break that soil  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:25):**  up again, so that other things can get down in there too.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:29):**  Absolutely, yes. So it is nature doing her thing. Mother Nature doesn't like bare ground,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:35):**  so she will always start to populate it with things. And very often, those are the things  
**[0:07:40-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:40):**  that we call weeds.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:41):**  So actually, what you're describing to me is that these various different plants that  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:47):**  you see in a field and these things that often a lot of people might refer to as weeds are  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:51):**  actually clues. And so you as the farmer are a detective trying to work out how to make  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:07:57):**  your land as productive as possible. And these dandelions or nettles or dock leaves are giving  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:03):**  you clues about the quality of that land. But not only that, they're helping to break  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:09):**  up the soil and restore that land. But won't they just carry on growing? Won't you just  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:14):**  end up with a field just covered in dock leaves?  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:17):**  In the short term, like in one year, that might be the case. But then what will happen  
**[0:08:22-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:22):**  is because all those tap roots have gone down and they're starting to build soil life underneath  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:28):**  the surface, then that enables other plants to grow. Those dandelions, docks or nettles  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:35):**  don't have such an advantage because other things are able to grow now. And so you start  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:39):**  to get many more species. And that's something that we call diversity and biodiversity. I'm  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:44):**  sure that's a word that you will have heard. And that's a really, really good thing. And  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:48):**  that's what we're trying to get to with regenerative agriculture. The more species you have of  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:52):**  different types, what will happen is that they will all grow at different rates. So  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:08:57):**  they'll all have their own little season, if you like. They'll all have different leaf  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:01):**  shapes and heights. And when you have that sort of thing going on, you can use the sunlight  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:07):**  much more effectively because you haven't just got a couple of blades of grass all at  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:11):**  the same height. You've got lots of different like solar panels really in the field and  
**[0:09:16-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:16):**  it makes it much more efficient at using the sun's energy.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:26):**  What happens to all the cow pats and the other poo?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:29):**  Well, this is all part of what we call cycling. So this is basically nutrient cycling. Nothing  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:36):**  is wasted in nature. And all the nutrients that the plant has gone to, all that energy  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:42):**  to make, the cow comes along and eats them and digests them. And then out comes the waste.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:48):**  But it's not waste isn't really the right word. It's the bits that the animal doesn't  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:52):**  want. And they end up sitting on the surface of the grass. And then in a really good meadow,  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:09:57):**  in a really good field, there's lots of bacteria, fungi and invertebrates, particularly dung  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:04):**  beetles that get in there and they break up that poo and they absorb all the nutrients  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:10):**  themselves and they basically start to recycle that poo.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:13):**  So what the cow's actually done, or the sheep or the other grazing animal, is to take that  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:18):**  carbon, take that grass, and it's turned it into a great big pizza, which is delicious  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:25):**  for all kinds of mini beasts and micro creatures. And they're going to eat it themselves and  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:31):**  transport it and move it down the roots of dandelions and all these other things so that  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:37):**  those nutrients are going to start getting back into the ground.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:41):**  Yes, the whole thing about regenerative agriculture is trying to work with these systems and to  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:47):**  support these cycling recycling systems. What we really want with regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:53):**  is not to have to add anything ourselves. We want to have a system that is functioning  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:10:59):**  so well and recycling all those nutrients and holding on to the water and holding on  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:04):**  to the carbon in the soil so that we don't have to add anything to the system to make  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:09):**  the plants or help the plants grow.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:11):**  What's the most important animal in the world?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:18):**  I don't really like that question because everything has its place. But there are some  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:23):**  species, some animals that are perhaps more, not necessarily important, but they have more  
**[0:11:28-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:28):**  of an effect on everything else than others. An example on the land would be wolves. So  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:35):**  wolves are a top predator. So they're right at the top of the food chain, if you like,  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:40):**  and they eat deer. And places where you don't have wolves, you might have too many deer.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:45):**  And that might cause a problem because they overgrazed everything. They eat too much of  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:49):**  the plants. So where the wolves do exist with the deer, they actually change the way the  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:11:54):**  deer behave. So they don't eat that many, but they do make the deer bunch together and  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:00):**  move around. And that means they don't hang around in the same place, eating their favourite  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:05):**  plants and overgrazing them. So that can have a really good effect.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:09):**  And when you mention that, actually that links to mob grazing, which is something that you  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:15):**  tend to associate with regenerative agriculture, where farmers are trying to recreate the role  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:21):**  of the predator. You mentioned deer, but if we think about, you know, the big grand American  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:26):**  plains where herds of thousands of buffalo used to roam, they would herd together because  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:32):**  in that way they were better protected from predators like wolves that would try and pick  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:37):**  off the young or the less healthy animals. And so in regenerative agriculture and mob  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:41):**  grazing, you're clustering, you're bringing those cattle together.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:45):**  Yeah. And it is, it's like I said earlier, it's about trying to mimic what nature does  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:50):**  because nature definitely knows better than we do. But if we do that with the cattle,  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:12:54):**  it means that they don't overgraz plants and they don't get to be so choosy about what  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:00):**  they eat so that individual plants don't get overgrazed.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:04):**  Which means they don't get sort of eaten right down to the nub, right down to the soil.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:08):**  And it's much easier and faster for that plant to regenerate itself, to carry on growing.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:14):**  So we've had an animal from the top of the food chain. What about an animal from the  
**[0:13:17-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:17):**  bottom?  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:18):**  Oh, well, I suppose we could go underground and we could look at the earthworm. So the  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:24):**  sort of slippery, wriggly earthworm, which is a really important animal in the soil because,  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:30):**  well, people call them soil engineers because they're going up and down, they're moving  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:35):**  things around, they're distributing all the nutrients and the bits of material and just  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:41):**  doing a really good job of recycling really within the soil. So yeah, earthworms are really  
**[0:13:46-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:46):**  important.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:47):**  What's the best sort of food to help make nature?  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:13:56):**  Well, I think the easiest way to think about that is try to mimic nature. So in terms of  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:03):**  kind of plant foods, if you like, I would look to trying to eat seasonally. So things  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:08):**  that grow naturally at certain times of year. So that's one thing you can do. And the other  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:14):**  thing is to particularly when you're buying meat or vegetables or grains or wheat or anything  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:20):**  really is try to find out as much about how it's been produced as you can. If it's been  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:27):**  produced from a system that is trying to be regenerative, then that's a good thing.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:31):**  And of course, that's much easier if you live in the countryside and you can go to a farm  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:35):**  shop or to a farmer's market. But even if you're in the city, you can still look on  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:41):**  the label to get quite a lot of information. So you can see whether that food is in season.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:46):**  Are there any other labels that we can look for, Alex?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:48):**  Yeah, you can look for particularly on vegetables, organic, which means that there will be far  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:14:54):**  fewer chemicals used in the production. And that would apply to meat and also for meat.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:01):**  You can look for welfare assurance on the labels. So RSPCA assured is one of them and  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:07):**  free range for your eggs. None of these are absolutely perfect. They don't tell you everything,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:13):**  but they help. And in terms of the things that we've been talking about today, the regenerative  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:17):**  agriculture, this is new. This is quite new stuff. So it hasn't really made it into any  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:22):**  labeling yet. So the only way to get to that is to try and talk to director producers if  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:28):**  you can.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:29):**  So as with everything, it's very, very difficult to buy brilliant food. What we can do is try  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:35):**  and buy better food. And so that means looking for labels, looking for seasonal food, looking  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:40):**  for food that hasn't travelled very far and trying to find food where if animals are involved,  
**[0:15:45-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:45):**  those animals have been reared to good welfare standards.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:15:59):**  That's about all we've got time for, but just before you go, we've got a couple of  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:03):**  experiments to help you understand the soil carbon sponge. The first helps to explain  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:08):**  the function of good soil in holding onto water. The second will help you test the quality  
**[0:16:13-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:13):**  of the soil in parks or in fields near you.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:21):**  If you have a sponge, it can be a bath sponge or the kind of sponge that you use for washing  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:25):**  up. And if you put that onto the kitchen surface and then pour half a glass of water onto it,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:32):**  then that sponge will hold that water, won't it? But then we can also extend that experiment  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:37):**  to show what happens when soil is compacted. Because if you press that sponge down, then  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:42):**  the water is let out. And if you pour more water on, it just it won't hold any more  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:48):**  water. That water will just run off. And so just with that one experiment, we can show  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:52):**  what happens with the soil carbon sponge when the soil is really healthy. But then when  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:16:56):**  we press it down and lose the water, we can see what happens when the soil is being compacted,  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:00):**  for example, by tractors running over and over and over the same patch of land.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:05):**  Now there's another experiment and it involves a chimney or an old bit of drain pipe. And  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:09):**  I wonder if you could tell us about that experiment and what it shows us.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:13):**  What you do with your drain pipe is you push it into the soil surface so that it's not  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:18):**  just sitting on the top. You have to sort of make sure that you're going down into the  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:22):**  soil and you're not just pressing on top of the grass. And then you can pour some water  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:27):**  onto the top and you can time how long it takes for that water to disappear.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:31):**  And if you take it to different locations and different types of ground, then you can  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:35):**  time it in these different places and see how long it takes. And in some places it might  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:40):**  take half a minute to disappear. And in other places it might take ages. And sometimes in  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:44):**  some places where the soil is really compacted, you can go off for lunch and come back again  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:48):**  and it still hasn't drained away. And so what's that telling us? Is it good when the water  
**[0:17:52-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:52):**  goes quickly or is it bad when the water goes quickly?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:55):**  Generally speaking, if it's disappearing, then it means it's going into the ground and  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:17:59):**  that's where we want it to be. We don't want it to be sitting on the surface where it can  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:04):**  evaporate or then just run off and be lost.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:07):**  CHEERS  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:12):**  Well, that's it. The end. You can let your adults back into the room now. I hope you've  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:17):**  enjoyed listening and I hope you've learned a little bit about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:22):**  That's farming by harnessing the power of nature. By farming in this way, farmers can  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:27):**  reduce their costs, improve their efficiency and produce better food. At the same time,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:32):**  they'll help absorb more carbon to fight climate change and help restore the balance  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:36):**  of nature. In other words, everyone's a winner. I'd like to thank my guest, Alex Tomlinson,  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-agriculture-for-kids---The-Homeschool-podcast-edt8qj#t=0:18:41):**  and thank you for listening. Farmgate is a partnership project for Farmwell and FAI Farms.

### Farm Gate  (Mon, 15 Feb 2021 16:01:20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. This is the first of two programmes investigating  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:10):**  the rise of vegetable and cellular meat alternatives. In the second episode, I'll discuss the ethics  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:16):**  and business implications of meat alternatives, but today I'm talking to Rachel Santo, a  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:21):**  senior research programme coordinator at the Johns Hopkins Centre for a Liveable Future,  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:26):**  where she works on sustainable diets, local food policy and urban agriculture. She was  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:31):**  recently the lead author of a review article published on the website Frontiers in Sustainable  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:36):**  Food Systems called Considering Plant-Based Meat Substitutes and Cell-Based Meats, a Public  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:41):**  Health and Food Systems Perspective. I started by asking Rachel if she'd explain why the  
**[0:00:47-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:47):**  research behind this paper was necessary.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:50):**  Sure, so thanks for inviting me to the programme and happy to be here. So our centre is based  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:55):**  at a school of public health, the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. And so we approach  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:00:58):**  most of our work with an interdisciplinary public health and food systems lens. When  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:03):**  we were looking at the existing research on meat alternatives, we noticed that the majority  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:07):**  really focuses on the technical aspects, the production processes or the consumer perceptions  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:13):**  of whether they would be willing to eat them. And there was far less on this bigger picture  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:18):**  view of what happens if we were to scale meat alternatives production up and consumption  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:22):**  up. What would that mean for the health of consumers or for the environment or for animal  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:27):**  welfare considerations? So we wanted to look critically at the claims that these products  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:31):**  are being sold under and highlight the complexity of the issues at hand and really identify  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:36):**  where more research is needed.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:37):**  You talked about the way in which Johns Hopkins always takes this sort of public health and  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:40):**  food systems lens, but why are those lenses so important?  
**[0:01:44-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:44):**  I think it's important to think systematically about issues when we're looking, when we're  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:48):**  considering introducing any new technology, but any product really is we can't focus on  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:53):**  one lens. We have to look at the whole picture. And so when you're talking about the nutrition  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:01:57):**  of a product, you also need to be considering the environmental impacts of a food and also  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:01):**  the implications for producers and for consumers who are eating those products, the economic  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:05):**  impacts, the socio-cultural impacts. So I think it's just important to look beyond one  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:09):**  field and make sure that you're really understanding how introduction of new products, especially  
**[0:02:13-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:13):**  new products that have never been on the market before, will interact with all these different  
**[0:02:16-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:16):**  features of our current food system.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:18):**  And does that link into sort of public policy in a way? You know, the way that food products  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:23):**  usually come to market is that, you know, customers want them or they don't want them.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:27):**  It's very market led. If consumers like something, then they'll buy it. Is there a degree to  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:32):**  which you're hoping to influence public policy around these products so that consumers, so  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:37):**  citizens or policymakers feel that they should be providing additional support for particular  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:43):**  products and less support for other products?  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:44):**  That's a great question. I mean, our research was really focused on the science that currently  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:49):**  exists. So we weren't looking at the bigger picture of the policy changes. That said,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:53):**  I mean, one of the big areas that we identified is that a lot of the existing research that's  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:02:57):**  been published on these products is funded or commissioned by the company selling those  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:02):**  products. And, you know, this isn't unique to meat alternatives. This happens in other  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:05):**  food industries, like throughout the food industry, throughout other industries, too,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:07):**  the pharmaceutical and medical. And I think it just poses that we need more research that's  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:11):**  independently funded and really can rigorously analyse the potential benefits and limitations  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:17):**  of different products. So, you know, whether it's food safety related or the environmental  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:21):**  impacts, we really want to make sure that our decisions are made based on science. And  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:24):**  ideally that science would be independently funded. So to the extent to which we can get  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:27):**  more government support for independent research, that would be one area in particular that  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:31):**  I think would be really beneficial to have policymakers weighing in on.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:34):**  And so to turn to the study itself, was there new research that you were undertaking here,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:38):**  or was it a review, a synthesis of research that was already out there in the public domain  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:43):**  in one way or another?  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:44):**  Yes, it was a review of existing research. We did a database search of three major academic  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:49):**  data journal databases to pull out studies related to meat alternatives. And specifically,  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:54):**  we were looking at both plant based meat substitutes and also cell based meats. And we wanted to  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:03:59):**  look at studies that had anything to do with the public health impacts, the environmental  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:03):**  impacts, animal welfare considerations, socio economic considerations for both producers  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:08):**  and consumers and also policy implications. So our policy side was focused primarily on  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:12):**  US policies. And so we looked at over 150 articles and of those about half had some  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:17):**  relation to one of those issue areas that we were looking at.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:20):**  I'm wondering what proportion related to cell based meat alternatives?  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:24):**  Surprisingly, way more than I thought, considering that cell based meats haven't actually well,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:29):**  they just recently were announced in Singapore, there's a company that got approved to sell  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:32):**  sell based meat, but there were I think probably 50 articles, 50 to 60 articles related to  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:37):**  cell based meat, but because they haven't been on the market up to the point of when  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:40):**  we were doing the research, a lot of the research is all based on hypothetical scenarios, whether  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:44):**  it's looking at the environmental impacts, they're all hypothetical scenarios of modelling  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:48):**  different potential inputs, but nobody actually knows what these companies are using, because  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:52):**  it's all proprietary right now.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:53):**  What was the reason for differentiating between these, you know, if we if we're talking about  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:04:57):**  alternative meat products, then we have meat, and then there's there's not meat. So, you  
**[0:05:01-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:01):**  know, why why why make that differentiation in the first place?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:04):**  So, depending on the consideration we were looking at, I mean, in some cases, whether  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:08):**  it's plant based or cell based, it wouldn't really make a difference if it's, you know,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:12):**  overall driving changes in conventional meat production, you know, the difference would  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:15):**  be the same, but for a lot of the other impacts we're looking at, whether it's environmental,  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:19):**  in particular, we found some notable differences, or even health impacts, it's cell based meat  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:24):**  in theory is supposed to be biologically equivalent to meat. So if you're trying to, in some cases,  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:29):**  they're planning to add or enhance the meat to have nutritional benefits. But at this  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:33):**  point, that hasn't come to market. So it hasn't been proven yet. But in theory, that could  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:37):**  have much different health implications than a product that's derived from processed plant  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:41):**  based ingredients.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:42):**  So when we're talking about plant based, just to define, you know, what that means, I'm  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:46):**  guessing that what we're talking about here is, you know, stuff that you could get in  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:49):**  a kind of a high end sort of deli type restaurant, which is relatively unprocessed, you know,  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:55):**  it's beans that have been kind of pressed together, but that's sort of almost the limit  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:05:58):**  of the processing right up to stuff that's a sort of fungus or pea based formulation,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:04):**  which is sort of created into a burger style thing. What is cell based? Just can you define  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:09):**  that for us?  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:10):**  Yeah, great question. Actually, I'll jump in before and go to the plant based. So we  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:14):**  actually only looked at plant based substitutes that are intended to mimic meat entirely.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:19):**  So that excludes other plant based products that can be used in similar ways, but aren't  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:24):**  intended to exactly taste like meat. So things like tofu, tempeh, seitan, or even just like  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:29):**  bean burgers, none of that was included as part of our plant based substitutes, because  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:33):**  they're there. Those are other types of plant forward protein foods, but they're not exactly  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:38):**  intended to mimic meat. So we're really looking at the I don't want to name names of big companies,  
**[0:06:42-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:42):**  but you've heard of Impossible Burger, the Beyond Burger, a lot of the Morningstar Farm  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:45):**  products, a lot of the different, very highly processed plant substitutes. So that's that  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:50):**  was one end. And for the cell based meat, so this is sometimes called lab grown meat,  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:54):**  or no kill meat, but meat that's grown from animal stem cells in a laboratory using techniques  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:06:59):**  similar to how we tissue engineer in human biomedical research too. So that these products,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:04):**  the cell based meat products are not intended to actually imitate meat, but they're intended  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:07):**  to be meat, just grown in a lab.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:10):**  And they come from animal cells, they are derived from animals. And actually, there  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:14):**  are some pretty key animal welfare issues associated with the harvesting of those cells.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:19):**  Correct. Yeah. So there's two potential ways that you could grow the cell based meat. But  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:23):**  right now, as far as we know, everyone is primarily using adult muscle stem cells. So  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:28):**  they take it through a biopsy from a living animal, or I guess you could take it from  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:32):**  a dead animal too, but from a from adult animal, there are hopes that they could take embryonic  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:36):**  stem cells and have a perpetual line. But right now, the industry standard is to use  
**[0:07:40-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:40):**  muscle stem cells.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:42):**  So are we seeing embryo cells being used? Or is that just something that's talked about?  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:47):**  It's talked about as a potential to, in theory, eliminate any need to have multiple inputs  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:52):**  of stem cells, because at some point, the stem cells can't perpetuate indefinitely.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:07:56):**  So they will have to do biopsies. And the frequency of those biopsies, how much is needed  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:00):**  to produce different amounts of meat, it's very unknown. We weren't able to find any  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:04):**  estimates really of how many animals are even required for the biopsies to produce the various  
**[0:08:09-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:09):**  amounts of cell based meat. It's really, there's a lot of unknowns there.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:12):**  If I could ask you maybe about the key takeaways in terms of the health impacts, and it's  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:17):**  in terms of the environmental impacts, perhaps that's the easiest way of getting into some  
**[0:08:20-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:20):**  of the detail.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:21):**  Sure. So from an individual health perspective, and I think the health, I'll break it into  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:26):**  both individual health and then like the bigger picture public health considerations. So from  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:30):**  an individual health perspective, there are still a lot of unknowns about these meat alternatives.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:34):**  I mean, yes, we've had some in the market for 10 to 15 years, but some of the newer  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:38):**  ones, especially we don't know that much about. And there are a lot of questions that even  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:41):**  though these products are derived from legumes, like soybeans and peas, which are quite nutritious,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:46):**  and which have been proven to reduce certain diseases. We don't know whether the highly  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:51):**  processed versions of those legumes will yield the same benefits for people's health. And  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:55):**  there are even more questions about cell based meats just because they're not yet on the  
**[0:08:58-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:58):**  market.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:08:59):**  I'm looking at the broader public health picture, there's even more unknowns. So we really,  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:03):**  as a public health center, wanted to kind of look into the questions around antibiotic  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:07):**  use and cell based meat production. There have been claims that you can virtually eliminate  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:12):**  antibiotic use from cell based meat production. And that's probably not true, but it's probably  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:17):**  probably would require less than the current industry standard in the field because it's  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:21):**  so large, but there really has been no research showing potential antibiotic use scenarios  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:26):**  in cell based meat production, or even just concerns with worker safety and community  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:30):**  health implications. Some of those bigger picture concerns just haven't been analyzed  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:34):**  in the data yet. But that was part of the reason we did this study was to highlight  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:37):**  where we need future research to be directed towards. And that's kind of what we're hoping  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:40):**  for. We tried to look into, you know, have there been studies modeling potential economic  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:45):**  impacts on producers of conventional meat or alternative meats, but there's really been  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:50):**  very limited research. I actually, I think some current research is being done in the  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:54):**  US, at least on this topic, but it's all it's all very new. And that's part of the reason  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:09:59):**  we wanted to highlight is, you know, you have to look at the big picture when you're talking  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:02):**  about these products, you can't just expect that they're going to be a silver bullet solution  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:06):**  to addressing one problem, but then they might actually cause unknown consequences or maybe  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:10):**  unwanted consequences in other areas of the food system if you don't consider those other  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:14):**  producers in the community.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:15):**  Jason Vale, Director,  
**[0:10:26-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:26):**  I think one of the challenges of of studies where we're taking us sort of a standard value  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:51):**  outdoor extensive and regenerative beef production.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:54):**  So that's, you know, the huge sort of variance there.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:10:58):**  And I wonder how you take account of that  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:00):**  in the work that you do.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:01):**  Yeah, it's a great question and a very valid point.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:04):**  So we decided because of the limits of the paper  
**[0:11:07-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:07):**  and the challenges of condensing all of this information  
**[0:11:10-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:10):**  into a synthesized product,  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:11):**  that we would primarily focus our comparisons  
**[0:11:15-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:15):**  to conventional meat.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:16):**  And, you know, maybe this is some of our US bias,  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:18):**  but the vast majority of meat in the US,  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:20):**  especially in a lot of industrialized countries now,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:22):**  comes from really industrialized systems  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:24):**  that do rely heavily on antibiotics  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:26):**  that require pesticides and fertilizers  
**[0:11:28-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:28):**  and the inputs into the feedlot beef and other meats too.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:31):**  We didn't just look at compared to beef,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:33):**  but that said, we did highlight throughout  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:36):**  where the comparisons would look different probably.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:38):**  So for instance, with fertilizer use or pesticide use,  
**[0:11:42-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:42):**  while our comparisons were with conventional meat,  
**[0:11:44-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:44):**  we did highlight that, you know,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:45):**  if you're looking at a system that is more regenerative  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:48):**  or that is more agroecological,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:50):**  those comparisons are likely gonna look a lot different  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:51):**  and might actually put the regenerative beef in favor,  
**[0:11:54-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:54):**  but we don't know because the data is really,  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:56):**  is actually quite limited in that area.  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:57):**  So I wonder if you can talk about  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:11:58):**  the environmental impacts more specifically.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:02):**  Big picture, I would say,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:03):**  whether you were looking at plant-based meat  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:05):**  or cell-based meat, both types of meat alternatives  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:07):**  will likely have lower environmental impacts than beef.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:09):**  And that's just because with few exceptions,  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:11):**  conventionally farmed beef  
**[0:12:13-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:13):**  has the highest environmental impacts  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:14):**  in almost every comparison you look at.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:16):**  So if that's your point of reference,  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:17):**  almost any alternative will look sustainable.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:20):**  It's when you start comparing these other meats  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:22):**  and protein foods that it gets more complicated.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:24):**  So in the case of plant-based substitutes, for instance,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:26):**  the environmental benefits are there  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:28):**  compared to a lot of other types of meats,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:29):**  whether it's pork or poultry or some types of seafood,  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:32):**  but the benefits are less pronounced than replacing beef.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:36):**  In the case of cell-based meat,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:37):**  the existing research is so speculative at this point,  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:40):**  but from the two studies that do exist,  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:41):**  the potential environmental impacts  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:43):**  are actually pretty comparable  
**[0:12:44-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:44):**  to other farmed meats and seafood.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:46):**  So there are not necessarily going to be  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:48):**  this catch-all solution to fixing problems  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:51):**  with all types of meat.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:52):**  And I will add to that,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:54):**  when you're talking about using the global values,  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:55):**  it is true that we did use a systematic review  
**[0:12:58-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:12:58):**  that included values from all over the world.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:00):**  That said, we didn't just compare  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:02):**  to the average or the median value.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:04):**  We also tried to include the range.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:06):**  So you could see that the range of production,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:08):**  because beef especially is,  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:09):**  all beef is not equal, as you know,  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:11):**  and the range can be so drastically different.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:13):**  So if you look at the lowest end of the range on beef,  
**[0:13:16-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:16):**  it's still pretty substantially higher  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:18):**  than the highest potential range  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:20):**  of the plant-based meat alternative.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:21):**  So the cell-based is tricky  
**[0:13:23-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:23):**  because the range on that is actually quite large  
**[0:13:25-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:25):**  because there are so many unknowns.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:26):**  I'm definitely not the expert  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:28):**  on all the different potential metrics you could use  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:30):**  in life cycle assessments.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:31):**  I've seen attempts at trying to quantify  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:34):**  more than just greenhouse gas impacts  
**[0:13:37-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:37):**  per kilogram of protein or a hundred grams of protein  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:39):**  or whatever metric you're using.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:41):**  I think the challenge is  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:42):**  there are so many potential variables you can look at  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:44):**  and so many potential units of comparison.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:47):**  And so when you have, especially with our study,  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:49):**  which is trying to be a review of existing studies,  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:51):**  we're basically limited to what already exists in the data.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:55):**  So to the extent to which future research  
**[0:13:57-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:13:57):**  can start incorporating other ways of looking at  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:00):**  and measuring potential environmental impacts,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:02):**  social impacts, health impacts,  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:03):**  and accounting for these different considerations,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:05):**  I think then our more comprehensive reviews,  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:07):**  comparing products to one another  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:08):**  could also be more nuanced and more complicated.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:11):**  But I guess in our case,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:13):**  we were just limited to what was already there.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:15):**  And that was, even with the environmental data we had,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:17):**  we were actually quite limited.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:18):**  There were only a few studies  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:19):**  that even looked at water footprints or land footprints,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:21):**  very few that looked at pesticides or eutrophication.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:24):**  So some of the big questions we had  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:26):**  were actually kind of hard to look at  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:27):**  because the research is still so limited in that area.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:30):**  We had a conversation recently with White Oak Pastures.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:33):**  Some of the criticism that I've seen on Twitter  
**[0:14:34-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:34):**  is centered on the fact that it takes two and a half times  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:37):**  more land to produce the food,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:39):**  which is again, going back to this efficiency point,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:41):**  but that kind of misses the point  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:43):**  that there are really sound public good benefits  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:47):**  from the farm there, 170 people employed  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:50):**  versus a feedlot farm where you'd have many fewer people  
**[0:14:54-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:54):**  managing a lot more animals,  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:56):**  at the same time as then having superb environmental  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:14:58):**  and social and community economic outcomes  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:01):**  associated with that.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:02):**  So there's so much more to bring into this  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:05):**  than simply the nutritional value of one versus another.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:08):**  Very true.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:09):**  And yeah, that's one thing that we try to highlight a lot  
**[0:15:11-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:11):**  in our research is that we don't want to hyper-focus  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:13):**  on just the climate change impacts  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:15):**  and miss this bigger picture.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:16):**  I mean, it's important to talk about,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:19):**  we have to urgently address climate change.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:21):**  We have to really consider how we can bring down  
**[0:15:23-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:23):**  our emissions in all sectors of the economy.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:26):**  We also need to talk about biodiversity,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:28):**  farmer autonomy, animal welfare,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:29):**  the community health impacts of living next to  
**[0:15:32-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:32):**  industrial animal production facilities.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:33):**  So there's really all these other considerations  
**[0:15:35-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:35):**  that you can't put down to one metric.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:38):**  Can I ask you a question,  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:39):**  which is about the role that scientists and academics have  
**[0:15:43-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:43):**  in broader communications to the public?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:45):**  Because when we have this conversation,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:47):**  we can get into the nuance.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:48):**  We can talk about the way in which, you know,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:51):**  there is a difference between the way beef is produced here,  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:53):**  the way it's produced there,  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:55):**  the differences between different types  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:56):**  of cell-based proteins, et cetera.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:15:58):**  But that message often is lost  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:00):**  in terms of the mainstream media.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:02):**  And I wonder how much responsibility you think  
**[0:16:04-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:04):**  academics have for making sure that those messages  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:07):**  aren't just simplified and reduced  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:09):**  to the lowest common denominator.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:11):**  Oh, wow.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:12):**  This is a great question.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:13):**  I'm glad you asked it.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:14):**  Because this is a debate we have a lot internally,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:17):**  both at the center with colleagues and with others,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:19):**  is, you know, a lot of the complicated mess  
**[0:16:22-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:22):**  of trying to solve these issues  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:23):**  comes down to really, really nuanced decisions around,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:26):**  you know, what metrics you choose here,  
**[0:16:28-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:28):**  how you present this in data.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:30):**  And so many people want to distill it to one sentence,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:33):**  so like a tweet or, you know, a headline.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:35):**  And you can lose all the nuance,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:37):**  all the variability in your data  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:40):**  if you try to simplify it too much.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:41):**  And I understand that for the most consumers  
**[0:16:44-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:44):**  or media readers,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:46):**  that they don't necessarily want all this nuance.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:48):**  But I do feel that if we're making decisions  
**[0:16:51-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:51):**  that are based on the science,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:52):**  we need to make sure that,  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:53):**  we need to trust that people can get more nuanced,  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:56):**  can start to learn the differences  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:57):**  in why it's important to make sure  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:16:59):**  that you're considering different variables.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:02):**  I don't know, even just comparing per serving,  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:04):**  per amount of protein, per kilogram of product,  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:06):**  you can come up with totally different interpretations  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:09):**  of data depending on which of those units  
**[0:17:11-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:11):**  you use in your comparison.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:12):**  And so you end up with these studies that say,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:14):**  lettuce is, you know, way worse than bacon or something  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:17):**  if you're looking at a per kilogram comparison.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:20):**  And if you're looking at per serving comparison,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:22):**  it looks a lot different.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:23):**  And so I do really think that,  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:24):**  I believe that people, the average person,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:27):**  could understand a lot of this data and this nuance  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:29):**  if we trust that they will  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:30):**  and that they won't just read tweets  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:32):**  or that they want to learn more.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:34):**  I believe that people can learn that  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:36):**  and can be willing to engage  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:38):**  in that type of deeper conversation.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:40):**  So how does it work?  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:41):**  Do you have a communications team  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:43):**  that every time there's a paper put out,  
**[0:17:44-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:44):**  you'll have a conversation with the comms team  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:46):**  and you'll work out what are those key lines  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:48):**  or is it just the, you know,  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:49):**  paper gets published and peer reviewed  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:51):**  and it's just kind of out there in the ether  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:52):**  and waiting for people to pick it up  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:54):**  and get in touch with you?  
**[0:17:56-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:56):**  So we do have comms team  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:57):**  and we do have those discussions  
**[0:17:58-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:17:58):**  and kind of trying to distill down  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:00):**  what are the key messages.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:01):**  And, you know, sometimes there are debates  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:02):**  even internally amongst the authors of a study  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:04):**  what the key messages are  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:05):**  and what we want people to take away from a study  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:08):**  because it's all in the framing, right?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:09):**  I mean, you can have the exact same study  
**[0:18:11-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:11):**  and two different people can describe  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:12):**  the exact same study results in completely different ways.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:15):**  And so I think that's part of the challenge  
**[0:18:16-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:16):**  of being in academia is trying to find out ways  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:19):**  to communicate and I think it's an area  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:20):**  that we could all do better at, including myself,  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:22):**  and trying to find ways to be nuanced  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:25):**  but also to get a lot of people interested in your topic  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:28):**  and make sure that they understand  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:29):**  what you're trying to say.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:30):**  It always strikes me that land use is the big opportunity  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:34):**  to solve so many of the world's crises  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:37):**  than the crises in nature that we're facing.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:39):**  We can solve climate change if we get land use right  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:42):**  at the same time as producing highly nutritious food,  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:46):**  restoring biodiversity, but it all comes down to land use.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:48):**  And so that kind of puts a lot of responsibility  
**[0:18:52-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:52):**  not just onto you, but to scientists and academics  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:54):**  working across this area to make sure  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:18:57):**  that their work isn't taken out of context  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:00):**  and allowed to be used in some sort of reductionist way,  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:03):**  but it contributes to a much broader  
**[0:19:05-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:05):**  policy development overall.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:06):**  Yeah, for sure.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:07):**  And I mean, even with just the land use debate,  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:09):**  there's just so much there because it really depends  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:11):**  on where you're located.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:13):**  And if you're in a country that's importing a lot of meat  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:15):**  because you can't produce enough of it on the current land,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:18):**  your situation is gonna look a lot different  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:20):**  and you might need to really have conversations  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:22):**  around what is the most effective or efficient way  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:25):**  to use our land if you're consuming a lot more  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:27):**  than what you're able to produce  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:29):**  in your space.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:30):**  And I think that those conversations are starting to happen  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:33):**  and I'm glad to see these debates are getting more nuanced.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:36):**  And I also think that it speaks to a broader picture  
**[0:19:39-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:39):**  that we have to be less polarized  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:42):**  in terms of our discussions.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:43):**  Like you can talk about the merits of regenerative grazing  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:45):**  and more sustainable beef production  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:48):**  while also talking about the need to reduce consumption,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:50):**  not eliminate it, but the fact that like the science  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:52):**  is clear that we need to urgently reduce,  
**[0:19:55-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:55):**  especially in highly industrialized countries  
**[0:19:57-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:57):**  where we already eat a lot of meat and dairy,  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:19:59):**  a lot more than what is recommended for health reasons  
**[0:20:02-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:02):**  and for other reasons.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:03):**  Like we can have that conversation that we need to reduce,  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:05):**  but we can also recognize the benefits for agroecology,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:08):**  for consumers, for producers  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:10):**  of having those systems still in place,  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:12):**  just maybe people are consuming less of it  
**[0:20:13-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:13):**  so they can get it from better sources.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:15):**  What do you see as the main promise and benefit  
**[0:20:18-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:18):**  of the growth in alternative meat products?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:21):**  Yeah, so I'd say one of the biggest benefits I see  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:24):**  is just that they can be a good gateway food  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:26):**  for people to begin experimenting  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:28):**  with more plant-based proteins.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:29):**  I mean, ideally from an environmental,  
**[0:20:31-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:31):**  from a nutrition perspective,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:32):**  we should all be eating less processed legumes  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:34):**  as more of our diets.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:35):**  Yeah, so there's another question.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:36):**  Yeah, do we just want to replace one processed product  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:39):**  with another or do we actually just want to eat  
**[0:20:41-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:41):**  more fruit and veg?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:42):**  Yeah, I mean, and it's not just fruit and veg either.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:44):**  I would also add in legumes.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:45):**  Cause actually if you look at the stats  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:47):**  of what we should be eating more of,  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:48):**  like we need to be eating like six times more legumes.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:50):**  And you know, so I think the emphasis should probably be  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:52):**  on like legumes, vegetables, and then fruits  
**[0:20:54-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:54):**  from like a nutrition,  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:55):**  but also from an environmental perspective.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:57):**  And yeah, ideally from like, from a health perspective,  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:20:59):**  it would be the least processed version.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:01):**  But when you get into reality, like one,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:03):**  a lot of people have never cooked  
**[0:21:04-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:04):**  with lentils or beans before.  
**[0:21:06-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:06):**  They don't know how to necessarily make them taste good.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:08):**  And so that's where one area that I see,  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:10):**  I hope that these products are introducing people  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:12):**  to the concept of like, oh,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:13):**  I like something that has peas in it, you know,  
**[0:21:15-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:15):**  and just acknowledging that these can taste different.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:18):**  I also am a little concerned that the emphasis  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:21):**  has shifted so much towards meat alternatives  
**[0:21:23-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:23):**  that we forget this bigger picture that we're not just,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:25):**  that it is not a dichotomy, that we don't have just a choice  
**[0:21:28-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:28):**  between conventional meat and meat alternatives,  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:30):**  but that you can have really healthy and tasty alternatives  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:34):**  like chickpea salad sandwiches or tempeh Reuben tacos  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:37):**  or dolls with, you know, with a whole grain.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:39):**  I think that the way that restaurants  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:42):**  and the food service industry seems to be really hyper  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:44):**  focused on these, like it makes sense  
**[0:21:45-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:45):**  from a capitalist perspective,  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:46):**  but from a health perspective,  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:48):**  from a diversity of our diets perspective,  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:50):**  I would love to see more of these less processed legumes  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:53):**  and entering menus and kind of helping us open up  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:56):**  our palates and diets to these other options.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:21:58):**  Do you have any particular concerns,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:00):**  having sort of looked at this in detail,  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:02):**  about specific sorts of plant-based alternatives  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:06):**  or cell-based alternatives as these things begin to scale up?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:10):**  The biggest concern I have, and because the data's so new,  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:14):**  it's still a challenge to really grapple with,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:17):**  but I mean, from the cell-based meat perspective,  
**[0:22:20-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:20):**  the environmental impacts don't look that much better  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:22):**  than most meats.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:23):**  These potential model scenarios,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:24):**  which again are potential model scenarios.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:26):**  So again, we really need the real data,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:28):**  but it doesn't look that much better than poultry, pork,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:31):**  like all these other alternatives.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:32):**  And so why are we spending billions of dollars  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:35):**  to shift this industry when the actual alternatives,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:37):**  less processed plant-based alternatives  
**[0:22:39-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:39):**  are really where we probably should be spending our money?  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:41):**  Why can't we put some of that money  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:43):**  into helping diversify our diets,  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:45):**  finding interesting ways to incorporate  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:46):**  these other foods into our menu?  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:48):**  So that would be one area that I see is,  
**[0:22:50-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:50):**  and maybe again, the data will turn out a lot different  
**[0:22:52-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:52):**  once cell-based meat production comes to scale,  
**[0:22:54-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:54):**  and I'll have to completely change my view.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:57):**  And just what I've seen so far is like,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:22:59):**  it does not look like a silver bullet solution  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:01):**  to solve a lot of these problems.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:03):**  These products are being sold  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:04):**  by multinational meat processing companies.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:06):**  So there are concerns,  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:07):**  or protein processing companies, I should say,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:10):**  a lot of them are invested  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:11):**  in some form of alternative meat now.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:12):**  And so some people are concerned that,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:14):**  this is just gonna continue to perpetuate  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:16):**  the consolidation of our food industry  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:18):**  and really continue to remove autonomy  
**[0:23:21-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:21):**  from the food producers and from the consumers  
**[0:23:24-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:24):**  to make decisions over the system.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:26):**  So the extent to which further research can look into that  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:28):**  to kind of, you know, to challenge it.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:30):**  I mean, there are people saying that in theory,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:32):**  you could produce cell-based meat at like a micro scale.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:35):**  I've seen some suggestions about that.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:37):**  I have questions about the extent to which  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:39):**  like proprietary information,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:40):**  like all of these things are gonna be behind closed doors.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:42):**  And some people are calling for government funding  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:44):**  to help make it so it's more accessible.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:46):**  So you could have kind of like micro breweries  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:48):**  or fermenting labs or something.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:51):**  That is one proposal being offered.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:52):**  I don't know if it's the solution either,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:54):**  but just that like we need more discussion  
**[0:23:56-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:56):**  around the inequitably distributed concentration  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/ALT-Meat---A-health--food-systems-perspective-eqek94#t=0:23:59):**  and our consolidation in our food system,

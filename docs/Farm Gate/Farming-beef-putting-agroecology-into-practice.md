### Farm Gate  (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:09:30)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:08):**  This programme is the first in a series in which I'll be talking to farmers actually  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:12):**  delivering agroecological agriculture on their farms.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:16):**  The experiences of the farmers we'll be talking to will vary.  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:19):**  Some will run large second or third generation enterprises, while others will be new entrants  
**[0:00:24-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:24):**  and tenants.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:25):**  The farmers in this series are working with the Soil Association as Agroecology Ambassadors.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:30):**  Now, that's a grand title, but what it means is that these farmers are working with the  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:34):**  Soil Association as part of their 10 years for Agroecology project.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:39):**  They're inviting people virtually, of course, onto their farms to help develop a better  
**[0:00:43-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:43):**  understanding of agroecology and to move us into a conversation about how this sort of  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:47):**  farming actually works in practice.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:49):**  Today, we're focusing on cattle, and in particular beef cattle, and I'm joined by two fantastic  
**[0:00:55-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:55):**  people putting agroecological principles into action.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:00:58):**  Nikki Yoxell farms at Howl Mill in Huntley, Aberdeenshire, where she and her husband set  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:03):**  up Grampian Graziers.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:05):**  Nikki has a small herd of native breed cattle grazing in an agroforestry system, and you  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:10):**  can find her on Twitter under the handle at Howl Mill.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:13):**  Denise Walton is an organic producer from Peelham Farm in Faulden, Berwickshire, and  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:18):**  Denise and her family farm cattle, pigs and store sheep.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:21):**  They have an on-farm butchery and they retail directly to the public.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:25):**  Denise can be found on Twitter as at Peelham Farm.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:29):**  Welcome both.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:30):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:31):**  Thanks, Vinay.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:32):**  To start us off, I'd like to understand just a bit more about what agroecology actually  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:36):**  is.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:37):**  So, Nikki, could you start us off with that?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:39):**  What is agroecology?  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:41):**  How does it work?  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:42):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:43):**  So, agroecology is basically bringing together agriculture and ecology, and the basis of  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:48):**  that is thinking about the farm as an ecosystem.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:51):**  So rather than thinking about nature and farming as two separate things, what we tend to do  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:01:56):**  is think about how the processes, the groups of individual organisms and communities actually  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:02):**  contribute to the functioning of our farm ecosystem or agroecosystem, as you might want  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:08):**  to call it.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:09):**  And so agroecology is about kind of harnessing that, mimicking nature, which is known as  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:13):**  biomimicry, and doing that in a way that promotes abundance, not only for nature, but could  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:20):**  also be considered as productivity from an agricultural point of view.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:23):**  Now, there's lots of talk at the moment about regenerative agriculture, and when you describe  
**[0:02:27-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:27):**  agroecology there, there's clearly some crossover.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:30):**  Is there a difference between what people think of as agroecological farming and regenerative  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:36):**  farming?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:37):**  From my point of view, I think that there is crossover.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:40):**  I suppose agroecological farming, as I said, very much bases the farming practice as part  
**[0:02:46-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:46):**  of an ecosystem.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:48):**  Regenerative farming tends to have a number of principles, so things like maintaining  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:52):**  year-round ground cover, maximising on disturbance, enacting and addressing limiting factors,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:02:59):**  trying to maximise on photosynthesis through that ground cover and various other principles,  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:05):**  most of which do tie in to agroecology and the way that you would harness that kind of  
**[0:03:10-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:10):**  ecosystem working.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:12):**  But I think that there is still maybe issues around wording and definitions, and I think  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:19):**  we're all still trying to work that through, really.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:21):**  But, you know, ultimately it's about how you can harness sunlight to produce energy and  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:27):**  do that in a way that supports water, nutrient, airflow cycling, all of those things.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:32):**  Okay, and Denise, I know before you were a farmer, you were an ecologist, and I wonder  
**[0:03:37-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:37):**  if you have any particular thoughts to sort of add there?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:40):**  Well, I suppose, I mean, the fact that we've got these two words, agroecology and regenerative  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:44):**  agriculture, in circulation demonstrates the shift in mindset that we all absolutely need  
**[0:03:50-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:50):**  to make the difference to the wildlife and carbon sequestration values of our farms.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:03:57):**  I mean, obviously, I mean, when I was a practising ecologist, I spent a lot of time walking thousands  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:03):**  of acres of the north-east of England and southern Scotland, and I saw then the impact  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:09):**  of intensive farming on habitats.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:12):**  That was my job.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:13):**  So, you know, I can see where agroecology and regenerative agriculture are shifting  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:18):**  that in a way that doesn't challenge the accepted norm of profitable agriculture.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:24):**  I mean, obviously, we're organic, which is certified, and that is, you know, as we've  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:29):**  discussed before, that's a rules-based system, because we are making this as a contract with  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:34):**  our customer that we are actually what we say we are.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:37):**  We are farming agroecology and going a step further, and we are being audited.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:42):**  So, organic, agroecology, regenerative agriculture, they're all very good terms, but one is much  
**[0:04:47-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:47):**  more rules-based than the others.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:49):**  But the shift in mindset that they express is very, very welcome.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:54):**  And whether it's organic, agroecological, or regenerative, it's kind of a mile apart  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:04:59):**  from what we would associate with traditional commodity agriculture.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:02):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:03):**  I think that's a really good way of getting us into this.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:06):**  Nicky, I want to come to you just in terms of, you know, getting into the farm systems  
**[0:05:09-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:09):**  a bit.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:10):**  Now, in other places, you know, when we've spoken before, you've talked about being a  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:14):**  new entrant, a first-generation farmer, and feeling that you had no choice but to farm  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:20):**  using agroecology.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:21):**  Where are the new entrants around who've made completely different choices?  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:25):**  So why do you say that you feel you had no choice but to be agroecological?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:29):**  We came onto the land, if you like, from a, I suppose, more of an ecological standpoint  
**[0:05:34-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:34):**  or viewpoint.  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:36):**  We enjoy being in the outdoors.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:38):**  Our background had very much been based in rural areas and in the countryside.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:42):**  And so we could see and appreciate the value of healthy ecosystems.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:47):**  So I think, and also when we first moved to Scotland and we took on this land, our priority  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:52):**  really was around how do we ensure that that land and that ecosystem that we were then  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:05:57):**  responsible for, that part of that ecosystem, was flourishing and was healthy.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:01):**  And then having kind of done some research and heard from some really inspirational people  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:05):**  and, you know, meeting up with farmers locally who were moving in that way, it became very  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:09):**  clear that for us cattle were absolutely going to be the way into farming that also gave  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:15):**  us that opportunity to support the land to be as healthy as it possibly could be.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:21):**  So there's that aspect of it, which is about kind of the mindset and the approach and not  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:25):**  necessarily just wanting to farm, but wanting to undertake land management that had positive  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:32):**  outcomes.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:33):**  Was it an economic decision as well, though?  
**[0:06:34-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:34):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:35):**  So yeah, I was going to say that the other option is about, you know, coming into farming  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:38):**  with very little capital.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:40):**  And so we didn't have any barns or buildings.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:44):**  And so we had to think about, right, well, how can our animals get shelter when the weather's  
**[0:06:47-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:47):**  bad or it's really hot?  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:49):**  And so immediately that pulled us into looking at agroforestry and then thinking about how  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:54):**  the cows fit into the life of those trees and that system.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:06:58):**  So yeah, definitely was combining the focus from which we were coming, which was ecological,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:04):**  but also thinking about how can we farm in a way that takes as little input as possible,  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:09):**  make sure that we were using the natural world around us to fulfil various roles like show  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:14):**  shelter and nutritional benefits from trees, et cetera.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:17):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:18):**  You talked about there starting up a farm with almost no capital.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:20):**  I mean, this is, you know, it's a huge risk for anybody that wants to get into agriculture.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:25):**  It's a huge barrier, really.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:27):**  It's very difficult when you're a new entrant.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:29):**  An awful lot of farmers, you know, they already have, you know, some family connection to  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:33):**  the land that they take on.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:34):**  So that must have been incredibly daunting.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:36):**  And I wonder if you've started yet to get to the point, I mean, how long have you been  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:39):**  going?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:40):**  And have you started to get to the point where you feel a bit more in control of the business?  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:43):**  Definitely.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:44):**  I mean, we've been going now for two years.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:47):**  So we're very, very new to this still.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:49):**  And we're looking to, well, we will be moving to a new farm this year.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:52):**  We've had a great opportunity come up.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:54):**  And that has allowed us to really think about expanding what we're doing and stacking different  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:07:59):**  enterprises on top of the beef as well.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:01):**  So we've definitely spent two years learning and then being able to have the confidence  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:06):**  to put ourselves forward for another opportunity.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:09):**  So I would definitely say that we feel far more stable than when we first came into it.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:14):**  And we were just, you know, every minute was a learning curve, I think.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:17):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:18):**  Well, talking of new entrants, Denise, you were a new entrant, but 30 years ago, you  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:23):**  started out just like Nicky, really, with 20 acres.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:26):**  And now you've got 650 as well as a butchery and an online retail business.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:31):**  That must be quite a journey over three decades.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:33):**  And I wonder if this is where you expected to be when you started out in farming in 1990?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:38):**  Well, I suppose there was always the hope that we would be here, but there was never  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:42):**  really the real expectation because I'm sure Nicky would recognise too that, you know,  
**[0:08:48-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:48):**  with hope comes a lot of naivety.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:50):**  And we were very naive when we started.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:52):**  And when we bought the small holding, which was £40,000 that way back then in 1989, it  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:08:58):**  had a shed.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:00):**  And we saw up here because the farmers between 200 and 700 is slightly marginal, that our  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:05):**  way into farming was cattle.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:06):**  So we bought cull dairy cows and multiple suckled continental cross dairy is how we  
**[0:09:12-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:12):**  started.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:13):**  But we always had this desire and vision to sell direct.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:17):**  We were lucky in that Chris was working on a farm locally at the time.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:20):**  So we were already considered part of the local farming community.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:24):**  But I think had we come in afresh to the small holding, to the area in Berwickshire where  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:29):**  we live, it would have been very, very difficult for us to have got under the skin of the farming  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:34):**  community and farming system at the time.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:37):**  Interesting you talk about sort of being part of the farming community and your husband,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:41):**  Chris, sort of working on other farms because you decided clearly that the mainstream, the  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:46):**  way that other farmers were doing things, that the mainstream commodity approach wasn't  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:50):**  for you.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:51):**  And I wonder why that was?  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:53):**  Well, I suppose really, because I spent a lot of time trampling over quite a lot of  
**[0:09:57-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:09:57):**  North of Cumberland and North East of England and Southern Scotland.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:00):**  And so as I've mentioned earlier, the effects of commodity farming, my background is as  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:06):**  a postgraduate ecologist and an absolute passion for plants.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:10):**  A lot of my work was in rare species and habitat management.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:15):**  You know, just literally filled my heart with sorrow to see the impact of conventional farming  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:21):**  on wildlife at the time.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:24):**  So we came into farming, I mean, neither of us come from farming backgrounds.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:28):**  Both of our respective parents were all medics.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:32):**  You know, we came into farming without any baggage, but with this clear vision that we  
**[0:10:36-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:36):**  would sell direct, be as independent as possible.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:38):**  The friends that we had made when Chris was working on a local farm, they all thought  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:42):**  we were crazy.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:43):**  You know, we were hairy toed hippies is what we were considered as.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:48):**  And they actually advised us against it.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:50):**  But we were very clear about what we needed to do, but we couldn't be organic initially.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:56):**  But that's another story.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:10:57):**  Yeah, and we'll come on to that because obviously there's a process of transition quite apart  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:01):**  from anything else, which takes time and takes commitment.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:05):**  But when you started farming, you said that you found that your land was pretty tired  
**[0:11:11-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:11):**  and the land around you was tired.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:12):**  I wonder what you mean by that, what you mean by tired and how you went about restoring  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:18):**  the productivity and the energy into that land.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:21):**  Well, it's the initial sense, very visually.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:25):**  The first thing that would strike me on these farms and the small holding was actually decrepit  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:30):**  infrastructure, sheds falling, fences not being maintained, walls falling, because it  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:35):**  just wasn't, you know, I don't know if farming was losing a sense of prosperity, infrastructure  
**[0:11:40-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:40):**  was not being maintained.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:41):**  I think that probably had quite a lot to do with the subsidy system.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:44):**  And then obviously with an eye into the biological, ecological health of habitats and having an  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:51):**  eye very much tuned in to indicator species, which is what I was assessing, I could see  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:11:56):**  that it was bereft of any kind of indicator species.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:00):**  And also we were very conscious of the amount of vet and med that our neighbouring farmers  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:05):**  and our farming friends were using on their livestock.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:07):**  So you kind of think, well, you know, what's going on?  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:09):**  So yeah, there was a sort of general jaded sense of, you know, of the small holding the  
**[0:12:14-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:14):**  farms around us.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:15):**  Initially we couldn't afford because we didn't have the capital, we'd kind of spent it on  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:20):**  actually buying the land to go organic.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:22):**  So we did start on a conventional footing, but I soon identified biodiversity hotspots  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:28):**  on the farm that we avoided when we were top dressing, we avoided those completely.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:32):**  And actually I might also add, Chris and I met at Y College and Chris's tutor was actually  
**[0:12:37-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:37):**  the John Nix.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:38):**  So Chris was, his initial training was very much in the conventional agricultural principle.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:45):**  So it's been a much stronger, a bigger transition for him than for me.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:50):**  But we very much had this vision of being independent and market, well, price makers,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:54):**  not price takers, which drove our vision.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:12:57):**  It's a great phrase and certainly one that I'm hearing more and more, this idea of being  
**[0:13:02-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:02):**  price makers rather than price takers.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:04):**  And I'm struck there, you know, when you're talking about this idea that, you know, kind  
**[0:13:08-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:08):**  of post-war the drive for volume production and that sort of growth of commodity agriculture,  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:16):**  which was never fully rewarded, which relied an awful lot on state support because the  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:22):**  farm gate prices themselves were being driven down and down and down.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:26):**  That just kind of leaves people feeling a bit sort of tired, even though they've put  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:30):**  their life and soul into the farm that they're working.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:32):**  Whereas agroecology and what you're trying to do and what so many other people around  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:36):**  the country now are trying to do is to find their own passion, find their own vision and  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:41):**  reconnect with customers.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:43):**  And Denise, I just wondered when you're talking about species and talking about ecology on  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:49):**  the land, I wonder if you feel that the best way to regenerate land, the best way to deliver  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:54):**  that agroecology is to target keystone species.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:13:58):**  So for example, trying to focus on the curlew and bring the curlew back, or whether it's  
**[0:14:03-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:03):**  to focus on the soil and habitat management more generally and naturally let the species  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:08):**  take care of themselves.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:10):**  I wonder if you have a view as to where the balance should lie.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:12):**  Well, the keystone species won't occur or won't reappear unless you've got the habitat  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:16):**  right.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:17):**  And it is, you know, while we all have passion and vision, there's also a lot of common sense  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:21):**  that has to be exercised.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:22):**  And very definitely we have to look at the habitats.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:25):**  And the first habitat, number one, is soil.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:28):**  So soil management comes first and then simultaneously, if it's affordable from all sorts of perspectives,  
**[0:14:36-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:36):**  it's habitat infrastructure.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:37):**  So habitat infrastructure had been degraded.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:40):**  We came onto a decrepit farm with very diminished habitat structure.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:44):**  So we started very early on, thankfully, we started very early on with grant aid to improve  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:50):**  the habitat structure and viability of our farm.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:53):**  And over the last 30 years, you know, it really is, we can see the dividends.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:14:59):**  It's quite extraordinary, much more than I would ever have expected.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:02):**  But soil too, that's an interesting one.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:04):**  And we've spent, we've pushed the boat out and we've had a very thorough soil survey  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:08):**  done of every single factor of soil analysis on every single field on the farm as a baseline  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:14):**  to work with.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:15):**  And again, that's showing, you know, really good terms and really good results in terms  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:19):**  of microbial biomass, carbon, organic matter.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:23):**  So we know what we're working with.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:24):**  You know, I suppose a lot of conventional farming and you know, this isn't, it's never  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:28):**  about blame.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:29):**  This is not about pointing the finger.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:31):**  We were all part of it.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:32):**  When Chris and I first came into farming, we're very much part of a conventional system,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:36):**  but just with a different vision, it's about rebuilding a natural asset.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:40):**  We've been degrading a natural asset and we're now seeing the consequences.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:45):**  We've now got to take a grip of that.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:47):**  Just going back to the land and land as an asset.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:51):**  You know, it's an expensive one, Nicky.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:54):**  And you know, you're starting out with 20 acres and obviously you want to be able to  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:57):**  grow your herd.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:15:58):**  And you said to me in the past that because renting is, you know, is expensive and you  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:02):**  don't have the capital there, you've managed to sort of set up a system, almost a barter  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:06):**  system for the land that you graze from other farmers by promising soil improvement from  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:12):**  the way that you manage your cattle, which is, which feels very innovative.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:16):**  And I wonder if that was something that was difficult to convince other farmers to agree  
**[0:16:20-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:20):**  to.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:21):**  We're really lucky that we've got some very open minded neighbours.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:25):**  And there are people out there who are very open minded and are willing to try things  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:30):**  at least once and see if that makes a difference.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:33):**  So, and I think also, you know, our cows probably do a bit of a good sales job themselves.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:38):**  We have native Shetlands and also white Galloways and they're particularly beautiful looking  
**[0:16:42-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:42):**  cows.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:43):**  So I think any landowner would be quite happy to have them on their ground and you know,  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:47):**  they're quite nice to look at.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:48):**  So I think that helps a little bit.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:49):**  But yeah, definitely we've approached neighbouring farmers who have got very marginal land, which  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:54):**  is perfect for our native cattle because they really do, you know, get fat and fresh air.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:16:59):**  They, they're very, very good doers in terms of, in terms of being able to eat kind of  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:03):**  quite what would be considered marginal or poor, new to value grasses and plants and  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:10):**  you know, and they do very well on them.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:13):**  So we've got neighbours who either don't have the confidence around having livestock or  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:18):**  haven't been able to, to invest the time or their own money into kind of the infrastructure  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:22):**  that you need.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:23):**  And so we've been very willing to, to welcome us onto their grounds, either at a very reduced  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:28):**  rate or for free, given the work that we're doing.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:31):**  And it is great when you then go for a walk around the land with the landowner and they,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:35):**  you know, they're very excited about what they're seeing.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:37):**  They're seeing the changes.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:38):**  And whether it's, you know...  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:39):**  And what are those changes?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:40):**  What are they actually seeing and how quickly do those changes come in?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:43):**  Well, we're seeing initially, we've only been at this for two years, so it'll be interesting  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:47):**  to see what changes happen over a longer time period.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:49):**  But what we are seeing is just an opening up of some of the sward.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:53):**  So some of the grounds that we're grazing is very much tufted grasses, which are fantastic  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:17:57):**  for voles and other small mammals, which then in turn are great feed for birds of prey.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:02):**  But quite often that means that those areas get taken over by these tufted grasses.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:07):**  So with the cattle going in and disrupting that, we're seeing these niches being created  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:11):**  that are allowing wildflowers to come through, an abundance on one particular bit of ground  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:16):**  of self-heal, orchids, birdsfoot trefoil, all coming through on land that had been very  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:21):**  heavily grazed previously.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:23):**  And the landowner absolutely delighted to see that and just couldn't believe that these  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:26):**  beautiful flowers were in their fields because they'd never seen them before.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:30):**  So why is that?  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:31):**  Is that sort of a combination of resting, but also having the heavy, heavy impact of  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:37):**  the hooves sort of getting down to seeds that were perhaps deeper down in the soil?  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:42):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:43):**  Well, the main thing is rest and rest is an incredibly powerful tool.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:47):**  We are practicing mob grazing through holistic management, so holistic planned grazing.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:54):**  And the tenets of that is exactly what you just said, which is this idea of high density,  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:18:58):**  high impact on a small area with the cattle and then moving them on.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:02):**  And they might not come back to that particular piece of ground for 30 days on the shortest  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:07):**  sort of rotation.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:08):**  And some places we only graze once a year.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:11):**  So, you know, that rest is absolutely the thing that is allowing those plants to come  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:15):**  through.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:16):**  And like you say, it's that soil disturbance.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:18):**  So we're creating optimal disturbance that is giving that space, that niche for those  
**[0:19:23-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:23):**  plants to come through into the sward and offer additional habitat.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:26):**  So that's a really good example of how the community around you has been supportive of  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:32):**  you as a new entrant.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:33):**  It's helped you out.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:35):**  It's made the finances doable because you've been able to work with that local community.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:39):**  And I wonder if there are other ways that the community supported you or other ways  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:43):**  that you've supported the community.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:45):**  Well, the community have absolutely supported us in terms of buying our beef, which has  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:50):**  been amazing and really very keen to engage with short supply chains.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:19:56):**  They see the cattle, they know that it's us and it's our cattle.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:00):**  They see the work that we're doing with them.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:01):**  And so very keen to support from that point of view.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:03):**  But the wider community are absolutely right.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:05):**  They've been really supportive.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:06):**  And we work with a number of farmers locally, good friends of ours now to share equipment,  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:11):**  whether that's trailers, livestock trailers, having to move our cattle around when we have  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:15):**  to take them to the abattoir.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:17):**  And then in return, doing things like fixing tractors or supporting them with moving animals  
**[0:20:21-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:21):**  or whatever it is that they need help with.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:23):**  And I think that kind of local community based support structures are just so important.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:29):**  And you'll find those in all farming communities.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:31):**  But for us as new entrants, it's been particularly valuable.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:34):**  It's interesting, isn't it, because I think when people think of farmers, and often I  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:37):**  think what farmers think of themselves and certainly the conversations around mental  
**[0:20:42-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:42):**  health and seclusion and loneliness in farming, there is a sense that a farmer may not see  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:48):**  somebody from one day, one month to the next.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:51):**  Whereas actually, what you're saying is that there's a really strong community, a real  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:54):**  sort of push and pull where people are chipping in and helping each other out.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:20:59):**  And as a community, you succeed.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:02):**  And that's fantastic.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:03):**  I wonder how important the community has been to you and your business.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:07):**  While there was the initial doubt about what we were doing, because what we were doing  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:11):**  was really bucking the trend, you know, going organic, setting up a butchery in Berwickshire,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:16):**  which is very precision farmed apart from our little outlier up here.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:20):**  Very definitely when it comes to very human issues of illness, grief, loss, the community  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:27):**  locally is absolutely indescribable in terms of the support.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:31):**  So these very human things are always there.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:34):**  When it comes to accidents, for example, you know, if there's a, you know, our neighbouring  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:39):**  farm had a fire, we all went in and helped him some years ago, our cattle got out, we're  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:44):**  wandering up the main road during the summertime, we had a fantastic, really fun community support,  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:50):**  including our local police force came out.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:52):**  So it was a really great community gathering in the middle of lockdown, borrowing lending  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:21:57):**  machines, we have a very good relationship with our closest neighbouring farms in terms  
**[0:22:01-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:01):**  of helping out when they're pushed to borrow machines.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:03):**  So that's really important.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:05):**  That's always been there and always been helpful.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:08):**  Now, you're just south east of Edinburgh, and Nikki talked about the way that the community,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:13):**  you know, quite a lot of the retail customers for her are from that local community.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:18):**  Do you have an understanding of where your customer base is?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:22):**  Are you selling all the way down to London and beyond or are you sort of largely within  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:27):**  a 50 mile radius?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:28):**  Well, actually, I think it's got probably quite a lot to do with when we started, because  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:32):**  when we started, there was quite a lot of doubts and scepticism about selling direct  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:36):**  as a farmer.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:37):**  So we found very early on, we had to go beyond our local community to sell.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:41):**  And you know, we have a regional farmers markets, a monthly one, but we really had to go to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:46):**  Edinburgh and Glasgow to sell our meat way back then and develop a website.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:51):**  So in a way, we had to go beyond our locality to sell because our locality wasn't ready  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:57):**  for us.  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:58):**  So yes, absolutely.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:22:59):**  Most of our stuff is Edinburgh, Glasgow, online and ethical retail all around the UK.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:05):**  I was just reflecting on what Denise was saying about having a local community that's kind  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:10):**  of ready and open to shopping locally and supporting local farmers.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:14):**  And I'm thinking that that's probably also linked to this, you know, the last year and  
**[0:23:18-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:18):**  Covid-19.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:19):**  And so, you know, in Aberdeenshire, there's very much a beef system based on barley, because  
**[0:23:25-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:25):**  you know, it's beef and barley up here.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:27):**  And I think that maybe locally people would have, you know, supported the local butcher,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:32):**  and it would have been quite conventional beef that was coming through to them and they  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:35):**  would still be supporting, you know, local farmers.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:38):**  But I think within with Covid, people are out and about more in their very local area.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:42):**  And that really helped because they were getting to see us moving our cows every day.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:45):**  And we come and have a chat and say, what are you doing?  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:47):**  And this is a bit different.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:48):**  We've not seen this electric fence before.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:50):**  Why are you doing it this way?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:51):**  And that would give us an opportunity to have that conversation that if we weren't in the  
**[0:23:55-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:55):**  middle of a pandemic and people, you know, didn't have anywhere to go, they might not  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:23:58):**  have seen us during the middle of the day doing that because they'd have been at work  
**[0:24:01-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:01):**  or school or whatever.  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:02):**  So I think that there's been a real shift in the last 12 months around how people view  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:07):**  the importance of local supply chains linked to empty shelves in the supermarket, but also  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:11):**  having the opportunity to get out and about in rural areas and talk to farmers and understand  
**[0:24:16-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:16):**  why they're doing what they're doing.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:17):**  It really makes the point, doesn't it, that it's so important for customers to be able  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:21):**  to interact as directly as possible with the producers that are making the food that they  
**[0:24:27-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:27):**  eat.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:28):**  And obviously for people being able to get out into the countryside, you know, whether  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:32):**  that's on footpaths in England or on, you know, on tracks and trails in Scotland, you  
**[0:24:37-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:37):**  know, critically important, just sort of seeing how things go, being able to ask questions  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:41):**  and hopefully chat to a farmer that's prepared to actually take the time to talk to them,  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:45):**  which is always important as well.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:48):**  Denise, Nicky is farming just the beef at the moment.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:52):**  You've got cattle, sheep and pigs in rotation.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:55):**  Was that always the case?  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:57):**  Did you start out that way?  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:24:58):**  And how does the rotation work in practice just in general terms?  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:01):**  So yes, we always were going to be, because we always had this vision of selling direct,  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:06):**  we were always going to have beef, cattle, sheep and pigs.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:09):**  So we've always had that mix.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:12):**  And we've, I mean, we had a traditional rotation, and then of course going organic, and now  
**[0:25:17-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:17):**  we're pasture for life certified.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:18):**  So we practice a more holistic rotational grazing and we're putting in the infrastructure  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:23):**  to do more mob grazing.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:25):**  So the actual rotation, the pigs, we rotate them from one 20 acre field to another 20  
**[0:25:31-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:31):**  acre field on a 12 to 18 month basis.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:34):**  And sheep have come behind cattle.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:36):**  So yes, it's been a pretty traditional rotation, but we are reviewing all of that.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:41):**  And not least, we are reviewing the impact of outdoor, I mean, our pigs are free range  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:47):**  and we've had Tamworth and Redge Rock Cross for 30 years.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:51):**  But we are looking critically at the impact of outdoor pigs on our soil quality.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:25:56):**  And we started actually working in order to spread the environmental burden of pigs and  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:01):**  we need pork for our butchery.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:03):**  And we're now discussing, we're sort of sharing the environmental burden of producing pork  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:08):**  and are in discussions and actually have started using pigs from organic farmer on sandier  
**[0:26:14-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:14):**  soils in Aberdeen.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:16):**  And you produce cereal, don't you, for your own pigs?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:18):**  I wonder, do you plough to do that or is it no till?  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:22):**  We're looking, we're going to minimum till.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:25):**  There's a slight issue.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:27):**  We've heard, we've done minimum till actually, sown grassland minimum till and that was fairly  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:31):**  effective.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:32):**  But we are in the early stages of reducing tillage and we're finding some of our min  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:37):**  till, no till, not as successful as we would hope.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:41):**  But we are moving more to, we're increasing cattle numbers significantly.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:45):**  So there's a lot more going under grass.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:48):**  It's really interesting because I think one of the sort of principles when we talk about  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:51):**  that at a sort of policy level is that you're sort of looking at the land and what the land  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:54):**  can best produce.  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:55):**  And it sounds like you're sort of going through that process at this stage with the pigs,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:26:59):**  looking at whether the land that you have is best suited, whether it's better to import  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:04):**  the pork from a more local farm and trying out lots of different ways of managing that  
**[0:27:09-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:09):**  cereal production, which sounds fascinating.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:11):**  It'd be really interesting to hear how that goes on over the next year or two.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:14):**  Yeah, it's really, it's basically learning the biological or ecological capacity of your  
**[0:27:20-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:20):**  farm.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:21):**  And we found when we were completely self-sufficient in cereals for our pigs, our farm was suffering.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:26):**  So we had to cut back on cereal.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:28):**  So we actually started buying in organic barley from local farms to buying in the acres.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:34):**  But even then there was an issue.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:35):**  So it's really looking very critically at the way we farm in terms of the agroecological  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:41):**  benefits.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:42):**  Denise, the retail side of your business was always central to your vision.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:46):**  When you set up in 1990, you said that it was very much, you know, it was big.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:50):**  You wanted to sell direct.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:51):**  Customers were very much part of your approach to farming and the way that you were going  
**[0:27:56-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:56):**  to make a living.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:27:57):**  And do you think that you'd be able to farm profitably and agroecologically if you didn't  
**[0:28:03-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:03):**  have that retail side of the operation?  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:05):**  Oh yeah, I think so.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:07):**  I mean, when we, first of all, when we first went organic and that was in 2005, immediately  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:13):**  we didn't have that 10, and that was 2010 to 15,000 pound annual cost for agrochemicals.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:18):**  So, you know, when you start farming agroecologically and start recognising and learning the sort  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:23):**  of natural capacity of your farm, you're cutting back costs.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:26):**  And I think in fact, there's been some really significant work done recently on the pathway  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:33):**  to profitability from an agroecological nature friendly farming perspective.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:37):**  And it is very much a refocus on profit margin as opposed to productivity at all costs.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:44):**  And it's showing some very interesting results.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:46):**  So the answer is, okay, it's not, it's sort of a bullet, but very definitely farming with  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:52):**  this changed mindset that it's actually, it's profit margin management, not productivity  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:28:56):**  management that matters, that you can actually start finding ways to farm financially sustainably  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:01):**  and obviously environmentally sustainable too.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:04):**  And you know, just another thing, you know, vet and med on parasite management, that's  
**[0:29:09-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:09):**  changed completely.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:10):**  So we don't have the same need for vet and med either.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:13):**  So that's interesting that you feel that even if you weren't having your own butchery and  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:17):**  selling direct, that just the fact that you're farming in an agroecological way helps to  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:23):**  reduce the costs of the inputs, including the medications, meaning that potentially,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:29):**  even if yield reduces a little bit, that there's still more profit there.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:33):**  But by the time you've built in that butchery in the retail business, part of the business  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:39):**  as well, then that's the point at which you really become price makers rather than price  
**[0:29:44-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:44):**  takers.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:45):**  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:46):**  I mean, you know, as organic pasture for life, I mean, we're producing fats, cattle, 500  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:50):**  to 600 kilo live weight within 24 months.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:53):**  And you know, we're not, you know, by no means, you know, highly productive farm, we've, you  
**[0:29:58-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:29:58):**  know, we have to manage marginality.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:01):**  It requires a different mindset, but it's very definitely possible.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:04):**  Having the butchery has increased turnover, because we're adding value on farm.  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:09):**  So we're actually shortening the food and management and financial chains to good effect.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:14):**  I want to come back to your butchery and online business in just a moment, Denise, but Nicky,  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:19):**  I wonder how you as a new entrant, you know, with a relatively small herd, how you've gone  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:25):**  about building up your customer base, because I think, you know, part of it is from your  
**[0:30:29-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:29):**  local community, but part of it isn't.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:31):**  Yeah, some of our customers live all over the UK.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:33):**  And it's been interesting seeing how many actually live in the sort of in the East Anglia.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:38):**  Interestingly because their feedback is that they're struggling to get hold of really decent  
**[0:30:43-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:43):**  grass fed or pastured beef in that area.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:46):**  So there's definitely a market there if anyone listening is considering that.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:49):**  But yeah, so Twitter for us has been a key way of raising awareness using Instagram.  
**[0:30:54-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:54):**  So that social media aspect really, really important and building that story and that  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:30:58):**  community online has been key to broadening our reach, I suppose, which has been fantastic.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:05):**  And interestingly…  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:06):**  Do you get a sense of who you're selling to?  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:09):**  Are they people, you talk about East Anglia, but are they largely rural people who know  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:13):**  a bit more about the way the countryside works already?  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:17):**  Or do you have urban customers as well?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:18):**  Yeah, we have both urban and rural customers, some who are just really interested and love  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:24):**  our cows and love what we're doing and just really engage with the story that we share  
**[0:31:29-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:29):**  and others who are aware of the ecological damage that some types of farming is causing  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:35):**  and want to still eat meat, but eat it in an intentional way where they know that they're  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:41):**  able to have a positive impact.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:42):**  And I think it's also about recognising that shorter supply chains mean that the farmer  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:47):**  is secured more of an income in terms of the percentage of the money that's going directly  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:53):**  to the farmer rather than through longer supply chains like supermarkets, etc.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:31:57):**  I think the other thing that links back to the community is that we've got some good  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:00):**  friends who are farming in a very similar way, who have really been an inspiration to  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:03):**  us when we moved up here.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:05):**  And they sell out of their beef immediately, you know, within an hour of beef being available  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:10):**  from them, it's gone. And they've been really supportive of then signposting customers whose  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:17):**  orders they can't fulfil by signposting them to us and saying, well, no, we can't provide  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:22):**  you with any beef, but you know, Nicky and James have got a couple of 10 kilo boxes left  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:26):**  that's available, why don't you contact them? And that collaboration and cooperation over  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:32):**  competition is absolutely central to the success of our way of farming for sure.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:38):**  So, Chinese, why do people come to you rather than going to the supermarket? Do they talk  
**[0:32:41-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:41):**  to you about animal welfare or environmental impacts or nutritional content of the meat?  
**[0:32:48-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:48):**  What is it that you think's most of interest to your customers?  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:51):**  Well, all of the above. I mean, we have customers contacting us direct about all those different  
**[0:32:56-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:32:56):**  aspects. My feeling is that health is quite a big driver. You know, we, funnily enough,  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:03):**  we get quite a lot of individuals perhaps who've been vegan, who have then had health  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:08):**  issues and have been advised that they really ought to improve their hemoglobin or the iron  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:13):**  levels of their blood and they need to get meat. So, yes, I mean, the longest conversations  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:17):**  are with customers who are converting to meat from being vegetarian or vegan for many years.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:22):**  And that's not a plug, that's actually how it happens, but it's still also environmental  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:27):**  and we also get quite a lot of customers asking us about the slaughter process and welfare  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:34):**  and how we handle our animals before they go to the abattoir. So, I think probably the  
**[0:33:39-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:39):**  health at the moment seems to be driving most of the conversations that people have with  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:43):**  us. And certainly at farmers markets, we do a lot of direct customer facing at farmers  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:47):**  markets. As one of Denise's customers, I'd say it's  
**[0:33:50-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:50):**  also because they make the best charcuterie in Scotland. It's phenomenal. So, that's the  
**[0:33:57-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:33:57):**  definitely one of the reasons that we buy. Fantastic. I know that we're doing other podcasts  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:04):**  around now about meat alternatives, you know, the growth in things like the Linda McCartney  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:10):**  burger and plant-based versions like that, but also cellular meat that's sort of being  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:14):**  grown in a lab. Do you think that there is a genuine nutritional difference?  
**[0:34:19-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:19):**  Oh, yes. If you're growing meat from a stem cell origin in a petri dish, without really  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:26):**  understanding exactly what the nutritional content of that stem cell is, you don't really  
**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:32):**  know what you're developing. Whereas what we do and actually published by Newcastle  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:39):**  University, which looks at four different farming systems, actually doesn't include  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:44):**  stem cell meat, but no doubt that will be looked at at some stage. And very definitely,  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:48):**  this is a peer reviewed published paper that demonstrates that all grass conservation grazing  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:34:55):**  has a higher nutritional content of omega-3 than the three other systems of supermarket  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:01):**  organic, supermarket non-organic and conventional. So, absolutely yes.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:06):**  Because we're doing this podcast to try and help other farmers to sort of see themselves  
**[0:35:10-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:10):**  in the agroecology space, I wonder if we just quickly talk about your butchery. Obviously,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:16):**  it sounds like a substantial investment and I wonder where the money came from for that,  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:19):**  whether it came from within your business because of the savings that you'd made through  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:24):**  reduction in inputs because of the additional profits you were making through the retail,  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:28):**  or whether you needed to take out additional bank loans and how big a decision that was  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:32):**  for you. It was a huge decision and it actually coincided  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:36):**  with us completing our organic conversion. So, it wasn't that we'd actually, we'd only  
**[0:35:41-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:41):**  just started reducing farm costs, but no, it was a combination of a European grant,  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:46):**  food and processing marketing grant through the Scottish government and a bank loan. It  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:49):**  was very squeaky bum initially, but we were very driven by our vision. So, it was difficult,  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:35:57):**  not least convincing people to buy our meat, chefs and restaurants. So, yeah, it was a  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:02):**  big investment. It was a big risk, but we are actually, and we would never have done  
**[0:36:06-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:06):**  it without the support from the bank or the support from grant aid. But wow, we are glad  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:12):**  that we've done it. We are really glad. Just as a final question on your system, Denise,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:18):**  obviously you are organic. You've jumped through those hoops in order to make the transition  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:24):**  in order to pass the inspections. How important is your organic certification?  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:29):**  Oh, it's crucial. With the logo on our label, it actually confirms the promise we are making  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:35):**  to our customers about the fact that every mouthful they take will have an environmental  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:40):**  benefit and not impact welfare and will also be healthier. So, it actually verifies our  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:47):**  promise to our customer and it gives us market traction for our products. So, it's absolutely  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:53):**  essential that we have both organic certification and pasture for life certification. So, it  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:36:58):**  takes us a bit further. Those two certifications are the gold standard, the gold standard in  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:04):**  terms of farming and meat production. And of course, Nikki, your pasture for life.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:09):**  No, we're not certified, but that's something that we're aiming towards and it's purely  
**[0:37:13-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:13):**  at the moment just because of the size of our herd and the costs of going through certification.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:20):**  But it's absolutely something that we're working towards. If we look at the standards, we're  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:24):**  pretty much doing all of that already. But actually going through that process isn't  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:28):**  something that we've done yet. But I agree with Denise that it is absolutely the gold  
**[0:37:32-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:32):**  standard. And at the moment, we're having to rely on people trusting us and knowing  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:38):**  us and getting to know what we do to recognise that we are 100% pasture-based. But no, having  
**[0:37:44-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:44):**  that certification will make a big difference to us.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:47):**  I'd like to because, Denise, you mentioned the importance of the health of your livestock  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:51):**  and the way that you can reduce some of those medications because when you started out,  
**[0:37:56-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:37:56):**  you were seeing an awful lot of expenditure on vet medications in surrounding farms. Agroecological  
**[0:38:02-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:02):**  systems rely on diversity and they promote abundant nature. And obviously, parasites  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:08):**  are part of nature. And I'm wondering with liver flue and other parasites specifically,  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:12):**  because I know that they can be quite a problem for farmers in wetter parts of Britain. Are  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:17):**  these things problems for you? Do you think that agroecological systems make it easier  
**[0:38:21-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:21):**  or harder to manage parasites like liver flue?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:24):**  Well, if I can relate our experience from pre-organic to post-organic. So pre-organic,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:29):**  we prophylactically treated our cattle for Rotavirus and Cryptosporidia and also thought  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:34):**  coccidiosis. When we went organic, which meant that we were no longer top dressing our grass  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:39):**  fields, coccidiosis stopped. And I mean, absolutely stopped. Okay, we've had a little bit since  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:46):**  because we increased our herd by buying another organic herd from a different part of the  
**[0:38:49-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:49):**  country. And obviously, they came with a different set of immunity credentials to ours. So we  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:38:56):**  no longer have to prophylactically treat for anything. And that is organic, agroecological.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:02):**  And I think really what we are witnessing or part of is a natural increase in the natural  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:09):**  immunity of our livestock.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:11):**  It's remarkable, isn't it? Because it clearly is a big worry and a big expenditure for a  
**[0:39:15-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:15):**  lot of farmers. And so if you're partly building up immunity and partly sort of building up,  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:20):**  you know, the rest of nature, so more insects and birds that predate on parasites, then  
**[0:39:26-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:26):**  that has to be a bit of a win. Nikki, any thoughts on this at all?  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:29):**  Just to say that I've never warmed my cattle, but we have done fecal egg counts and they've  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:33):**  come back as zero. So I think for us, the combination of mob grazing and agroforestry,  
**[0:39:40-0:39:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:40):**  where the cattle are getting access to trees, which have got natural tannins, which is offering  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:45):**  kind of a natural and fermentic, is those are the things that are making the difference.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:49):**  And the fact that we graze very tall sward, so tall grass, and sometimes the grass is  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:55):**  taller than our cattle. I mean, they are small cattle. But you know, we've got festives and  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:39:59):**  cocks that stand above five foot, so that the cattle are eating the seed heads and they're  
**[0:40:04-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:04):**  keeping their heads high and they're well out of the parasite zone down in the bottom  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:07):**  of the grass. So we absolutely believe that this approach is enabling us to not have to  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:12):**  give any medication to our cattle.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:14):**  Just bringing us to the end, then I wonder, Nikki, let's start with you. Are there mistakes  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:20):**  that you think you've made over the last couple of years, even, you know, before you actually  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:24):**  went into farming when you were just thinking about going into farming, things that you'd  
**[0:40:27-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:27):**  do differently in retrospect, if you had your time again?  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:30):**  Absolutely. So many mistakes, but so many learning opportunities. And would say that  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:35):**  the, it's a bit cheesy to say it, but the community and the people around us and the  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:40):**  people that supported us have been absolutely invaluable. And always having somebody to  
**[0:40:44-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:44):**  go to for advice or just to kind of throw ideas around with has been so, so important.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:50):**  But yeah, always making mistakes, always learning from them. And just, you know, I suppose the  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:40:55):**  benefit of that is that, you know, if you are going with this learning open mindset,  
**[0:41:00-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:00):**  then yeah, you can make those changes. And you can reflect on how you can do things differently  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:07):**  rather than putting it down to something that, oh, well, that's just the way the soil is,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:12):**  or that's just because the weather's the way it is. Actually, it's about how can I adapt?  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:16):**  How can I change what I'm doing to make sure that the outcome is as positive as possible?  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:21):**  Thank you, Nicky. And Denise, you've been in this business for 30 years and, you know,  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:25):**  you talked about being a new entrant. Now you're into succession. Your son is working  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:29):**  on the farm and his family as well. If you had your time again, are there things that  
**[0:41:33-0:41:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:33):**  you'd do differently? Were you broadly happy with where you are?  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:36):**  Well, I think definitely we would have started planting quicker, getting hedgerows, getting  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:40):**  the farm infrastructure improved much more quickly. And very definitely we wouldn't have  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:45):**  had continental cost cattle. We would have gone straight into native breeds immediately  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:49):**  and started building up immunity immediately. And of course, going organic straight away,  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:54):**  that would have been fantastic, but it just wasn't affordable at the time. So, those are  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:41:59):**  sort of three things possibly. Fantastic. You've both been wonderful. It's  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming-Beef---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-epev4d#t=0:42:04):**  been so good to talk to you about your systems and your experiences. I'd like to thank my

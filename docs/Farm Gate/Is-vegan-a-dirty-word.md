### Farm Gate  (Sat, 04 Jan 2020 16:31:59)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:00):**  Hello. On Farmgate today, prompted by a recent blog by Tara Garnett from FCRN, the Food and  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:11):**  Climate Research Network, I'm asking the question, has vegan become a dirty word?  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:16):**  It seems pretty crazy that we've reached the stage where this question is even formulated,  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:21):**  let alone asked. But with food having become central to the mission to avert the global  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:26):**  climate crisis, it seems that people's personal choices about what they eat have become a  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:31):**  central battleground. Do you think that you're a better person because you're a vegan? Or  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:36):**  because you only eat meat from grass-fed livestock? Or perhaps because you refuse to eat anything  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:41):**  that's been produced further than 20 miles away? Well, today I'm going to chew the  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:46):**  fat – or suck the soya curd, if you prefer – with two people who care passionately  
**[0:00:51-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:51):**  about the impacts of the food they eat.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:53):**  Later in the programme, I'll speak to Caroline Grindrod, a regenerative meat producer from  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:00:58):**  Cumbria. But first of all, let's hear from Dr Tara Garnett from FCRN. And following on  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:03):**  from her blog, I asked her, has vegan become a dirty word?  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:10):**  I don't think we're at a stage where vegan is a dirty word within the kind of public  
**[0:01:15-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:15):**  consciousness. But within some within the environmental community, I do sense this dis-ease  
**[0:01:22-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:22):**  with the word, because in their minds, it has become aligned with a particular worldview,  
**[0:01:30-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:30):**  which represents everything that they reject. And I think that worldview is seen as big  
**[0:01:38-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:38):**  business, alienation from the natural world, processed food, food without soul, as it were.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:48):**  And I think that was what I was trying to explore in my blog, because I think that's  
**[0:01:53-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:01:53):**  a very caricatured position of veganism, because it in itself is a much more complex concept,  
**[0:02:01-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:01):**  and people eat for lots and lots of very complex reasons. I think there is some, it has become,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:09):**  the lifestyle of veganism has become problematic for some environmentalists today.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:17):**  When you say that, and yet many eco omnivores, if you like, and green vegans, I think they  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:24):**  kind of have the same goals, really, you know, we're trying to solve environmental problems.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:30):**  So I wonder, and I think you're quite right, that there is a competition of ideas, you  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:35):**  know, that's taking place, which can be quite combative. And why do you think that is? Why  
**[0:02:40-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:40):**  is it combative?  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:42):**  So I think it's really, really complex. Now, I think one of the, what it hinges on, to  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:49):**  an extent, is how we see our relationship with the natural world. And that's the first  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:02:55):**  thing. And I think the second thing is that what is the counterfactual that people fear?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:02):**  And to explain that, what I think some of the veganism posits itself, that the kind  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:09):**  of what it sees as the opposite of veganism is perhaps a world in which everyone carries  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:16):**  on eating meat much as we do today, much as trends suggest we're doing more of, which  
**[0:03:22-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:22):**  is rising consumption of large quantities of industrially produced, intensively produced  
**[0:03:32-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:32):**  food.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:33):**  I don't think anybody would disagree within the environmental movement, at least that  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:38):**  model simply isn't viable. Business as usual isn't an option.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:44):**  Their view is, I think, that this is the future that they fear, and therefore veganism represents  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:03:53):**  a better way forward. I think there's another view. I think there are also people, perhaps  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:00):**  not within the very close-knit environmental community, but who see this rising animal  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:08):**  consumption, this rising demand for animal consumption, and say, well, look, we can't  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:13):**  actually do anything about this demand because, like, the laws of supply and demand are fixed  
**[0:04:18-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:18):**  by God, and therefore we need to give people what they want in the least damaging way possible.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:26):**  And for them, actually, intensive production looks like the least bad way forward. So there  
**[0:04:32-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:32):**  is that environmental position, and I would call that quite the kind of mainstream green  
**[0:04:38-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:38):**  light position. Then you go back to the sort of eco-omnivores who perhaps are more optimistic  
**[0:04:47-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:47):**  about humanity, who perhaps feel that actually we can make it work, we can integrate ourselves  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:04:55):**  with the natural world, that we are not vermin on the face of this earth, and that actually  
**[0:05:00-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:00):**  we can – and they have a very strong sense of history, and that this is what humans have  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:08):**  done, and therefore the past is an indication of the future. Plus, probably quite a strong  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:14):**  emphasis on ideas about working with nature and nature being a guide.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:20):**  And I think that's interesting, to sort of get into that, because I think you've  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:24):**  brought up nature a couple of times, and it's this idea of the natural world that seems  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:30):**  to me to be quite important. If we think about Britain, obviously at a global level it's  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:35):**  slightly different because there are still wildernesses that are relatively untouched  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:39):**  by human beings. But in Britain, is there such a thing as a natural environment?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:44):**  No. I mean, so just a couple of things here, because I think what we'll come back to  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:51):**  is also perhaps there's a difference in the view to which we are connected with the  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:05:56):**  rest of the world, as opposed to the extent to which we are, as Britain, an island and  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:02):**  therefore responsible for our own food production and consumption. But I'll leave that for  
**[0:06:07-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:07):**  a moment. So is there any nature in Britain? No, but there are greater natures and lesser  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:14):**  natures. So, you know, at one level you could say everything is cultural now, because even  
**[0:06:20-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:20):**  in the most remote corners of the Amazon rainforest you can see traces of human kind of modification.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:29):**  But that's, you know, you can take that argument so far, too far. I mean, there is  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:33):**  a difference between a car park and the Amazon rainforest. So, you know, there's culture  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:38):**  and culture. When it comes to Britain, yes, of course we have shaped the landscape, but  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:45):**  there are wilder and less wild parts of it. So I think it is a question, what kind of  
**[0:06:51-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:51):**  landscape do we want, do we value? But I think this is where it links also with the fact  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:06:58):**  that we are part of a global community. It's a very, very simplistic notion to suggest  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:06):**  that we adopt this push model, that we in the UK have to feed the world, the starving  
**[0:07:11-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:11):**  gases, et cetera, because we know very well that hunger arises from lack of access and  
**[0:07:19-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:19):**  affordability and lack of agency rather than a lack of food per se. But at the same time,  
**[0:07:27-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:27):**  I think we do have to bear the global context in mind. And this is why I personally come  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:34):**  back to the point of view that I cannot see a world where we meet some of the environmental  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:41):**  challenges that we face, biodiversity loss and climate change, without reducing our consumption  
**[0:07:48-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:48):**  of animal products, even in a country like the UK, which is good at grass.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:07:55):**  So going back to the idea of vegan and again, why this becomes combative and why people  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:01):**  feel threatened by it. I suppose that it's perhaps part of it's because you've got sort  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:06):**  of polar opposites, people who just carry on eating meat in the same way that they have  
**[0:08:11-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:11):**  always eaten it and don't challenge themselves and their consumption behaviours. And then  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:15):**  people at the other extreme who have taken a very, very different set of life and dietary  
**[0:08:20-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:20):**  choices. And so I wonder how we can take heat out of this debate and if there's a way of  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:28):**  creating a conversation which isn't just set at those polar opposite points.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:33):**  Absolutely. And I think one of the other things that might be worth bringing into the discussion  
**[0:08:38-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:38):**  is the idea of motive. And I think people were sort of more sympathetic towards veganism  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:45):**  in the past. They might have sort of laughed at it or thought it was eccentric or a bit  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:51):**  extreme or whatever. But back when it was really quite hard to be vegan, there was a  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:08:57):**  kind of well credit due or power to your elbows sort of respect because it might not have  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:04):**  been much fun. But now that it's easier, I think there is a strong strand of sort of  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:10):**  hair, shirt and morality within the environmental movement that they don't really like the fact  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:15):**  that it's easy and they don't like the fact that industry is catering to this increased  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:20):**  demand and therefore making it even easier. So I think that's an important element to  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:26):**  bear in mind because I think it also links to the whole lifestyles, life ways approach  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:32):**  of some of the kind of eco omnivores who are working hard on the land and struggling and  
**[0:09:40-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:40):**  trying very hard to do and be something different.  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:48):**  That was Dr Tara Garnett from the Food and Climate Research Network. Caroline Grindrod  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:54):**  is a regenerative hill farmer and world a culture consultant who lives in an area of  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:09:58):**  Cumbria perhaps best known for producing Beatrix Potter. She also runs a meat business called  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:04):**  Primal Meats. Perhaps surprisingly, Caroline believes the vegetarian and vegan movements  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:10):**  have been hugely important in terms of raising the environmental challenges associated with  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:14):**  meat production higher up the public agenda. As a regenerative producer, Caroline advocates  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:20):**  systems that seek to mimic the functions of nature, keeping soils covered, promoting photosynthesis,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:27):**  managing water, integrating trees and other flora, working with nature to oxidise methane  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:33):**  and sequester carbon. But I put it to her that this type of farming is far from normal  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:40):**  in the United Kingdom.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:42):**  That's quite right and I think that's where veganism and vegetarianism is highlighting  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:45):**  that issue is we've got some very dysfunctional in terms of natural processes, dysfunctional  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:51):**  food systems. So we've decoupled the system. We've taken what was a beautifully functioning  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:10:57):**  ecosystem of all those climate cooling mechanisms built within it and we've taken the animals  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:02):**  away and put them in sheds and then we ploughed up the land and created bare soil and we're  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:07):**  using fossil fuels to produce our food. So we've got a very broken system. But the answer  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:11):**  isn't simply just not eating meat. We can produce meat in a very nature friendly way  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:18):**  that is encouraging all of those hydrological functions that are helping keep the planet  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:23):**  cool. And we can also produce plants in that way. But you can also buy plants that are  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:28):**  produced from ploughed land that's using energy intensive fertilisers, uses pesticides to  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:34):**  kill all the insects, uses herbicides to kill all the wildflowers and poisons the seas.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:39):**  And that can be a plant diet. So it's really just not as simple as saying eating plants  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:43):**  is better. We need to start to broaden out the conversation into how does that influence  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:48):**  and impact land use.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:50):**  So you mentioned land use there and that seems to me that it's the crux of what we're talking  
**[0:11:54-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:11:54):**  about. And you're a regenerative farmer. So if you were going to a new piece of land,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:02):**  a new farm that you didn't know, what's the first thing you do? What's that first building  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:08):**  block of creating a regenerative farm?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:12):**  So I use holistic management as my main kind of framework for managing landscapes. And  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:17):**  I think actually what's the important point is you can't just manage land and we're trying  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:20):**  to do that. We have to manage the people and make it profitable. So what we always do is  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:26):**  create a context. We talk about what do you want to do here? You know, it's all very well  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:30):**  trying to pay farmers just to be environmental guardians, but that's not why they went into  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:34):**  farming. So we've got to try and fit their food producers and we can do it so much better.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:38):**  We have to do it so much better. But ultimately, we've got to design a system that fits around  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:42):**  the landscape that they're on, what they actually want to do and make sure it's producing food  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:48):**  that's very healthy, sustainable food that's appropriate for the culture. So we design  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:53):**  a system based on all of those things. And then really it's about looking at those ecological  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:12:59):**  principles. So we say, OK, how can we improve this farming system so it's supporting the  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:03):**  hydrological function, the water cycle? How can we build soil so that it's improving the  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:08):**  mineral cycle and making sure that we are cycling those minerals so that we've got potentially  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:13):**  maybe animals in that system or just ways of making sure that the minerals have been  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:17):**  passed through and up into our food, which is a huge issue. And then we'll be looking  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:21):**  at energy flow. How do we make sure that we've got plants in the ground growing all year  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:25):**  round, whether we're growing plants or we're growing animals, we need to be increasing  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:29):**  photosynthesis, which is driving carbon sequestration. And community dynamics, we need a complex  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:36):**  and resilient food web, which includes livestock or whatever we're trying to grow. But it also  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:42):**  has to include lots of other animals and species too, if it's going to be resilient and complex.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:47):**  When you say other species, you mean nature? Nature and wildlife. In order to create a  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:13:54):**  system which has no plagues, as soon as you simplify a system down to one or two species,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:01):**  you then have to really work hard to control everything. And that costs money. We have  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:05):**  to spray every weed, we have to use pesticides, herbicides, and then we've taken out the natural  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:11):**  pathways of fertility, which happens through the microbial interactions with photosynthesis.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:17):**  So we've then got to bring in energy intensive fertilisers to feed the plants. The whole  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:20):**  thing then becomes extremely expensive, which is why a lot of farmers are not making any  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:26):**  money anymore. We're dealing with the symptoms all the time in very costly ways, not just  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:30):**  to our pocket, but usually those costly ways are very environmentally costly too.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:36):**  And those interventions, those interventions that you mentioned, the spraying of pesticides,  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:40):**  etc. An awful lot of that technology, those sort of paid for interventions, when they're  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:46):**  invented, when they're patented, owned by a company, of course, they're promoted out  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:50):**  into farming media and that sort of thing. But what you're talking about, it strikes  
**[0:14:56-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:14:56):**  me, is more about technique than it is about technology per se. And in that regard, these  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:04):**  techniques, if they were better shared amongst the farming community, could be available  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:08):**  for everybody and reduce costs potentially quite significantly.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:12):**  Absolutely. So the first things we look at with the farmers is, you know, where's your  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:16):**  main cost centre? So we look at separating out all of the different businesses. They  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:20):**  usually got sheep operations and cattle operations. And often farmers are focused on how much  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:25):**  money can we bring in? You know, their sales. And very rarely actually look at how much  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:29):**  they're spending to achieve those sales. So what we look at is, you know, how much is,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:33):**  you know, if you actually get a farmer to sit down and say, how much does it cost to  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:36):**  me and vet med and feed costs, mineral blocks, for, you know, machinery costs, fossil fuels,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:42):**  you know, petrol, you know, all your contracts costs. What could we actually get rid of if  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:46):**  we created a truly natural ecosystem, you know, an agro-ecological system that essentially  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:54):**  has building its own nutrients and we are getting rid of those pests and diseases that  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:15:59):**  are coming out from, you know, because we've been balanced the system, you can get rid  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:02):**  of a huge number of your costs and therefore you're just naturally more profitable. And  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:06):**  then added to that, there's, you know, a lot of evidence and we're certainly finding it  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:11):**  on the farms we're working with, you can often actually increase your production. In the  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:16):**  UK, we maybe don't have such scope to increase production as some of the people in the dry  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:21):**  lands of the world are experiencing, but there's still great scope to actually, you know, with  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:26):**  the conversation so far has been very much around land sparing and the whole argument  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:31):**  around sort of separating ourselves from nature and saying, okay, let's become more efficient  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:35):**  on this agricultural land so we can give more back to nature. The problem is that that's  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:39):**  based on models of farming that are, you know, often very good and conservation farming comes  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:44):**  from that kind of movement and, you know, some of the organic farming, you know, often  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:49):**  it reduces your productivity, but when you actually start to mimic ecosystems and use  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:55):**  these regenerative practices, which is what we teach, we find you can actually increase  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:16:59):**  productivity because you, you know, ecosystems, not truly pristine natural ecosystems that  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:04):**  are functioning at the most high level, are the most, you know, they produce the most  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:09):**  food in terms of biomass in the whole world. It's way beyond what we can produce from our  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:15):**  intensive agricultural systems. So what we need to get a lot better at is understanding  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:19):**  how to make that work in each region with different, you know, contexts.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:24):**  I'm struck by this idea that you can actually increase the productivity. Actually, I guess  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:30):**  we need to take a step back and just understand and define what we mean by productivity. So  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:35):**  are you talking about an increase in overall yield or are you talking about an increase  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:40):**  in yield relative to input cost?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:44):**  Overall yield and reducing of input costs.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:48):**  This is staggering because, I mean, you know, this is the criticism, isn't it, of nature  
**[0:17:53-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:53):**  farming, of organic farming overall, that it's great in patches. And isn't it wonderful  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:17:59):**  because we're, you know, we're helping to restore nature in these pockets of land, but  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:04):**  we can never feed a growing global population if we farm that way everywhere. But what you're  
**[0:18:10-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:10):**  suggesting is that we can do that.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:13):**  Yeah, and I believe we can. And I'm not, you know, this isn't big false promises. I'm very  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:19):**  careful about this. But if, and if you just suddenly said, right, well, if you, you need  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:24):**  to change the whole system. So often farmers used to ask me to come in and say, you know,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:29):**  how can we be more productive or more sustainable? But they're not willing to look at, you know,  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:32):**  they're dairy farmers or they're a beef farmer. So, and they really just wanted to tweak what  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:38):**  they're already doing. Well, we don't do that. We look at changing the whole system to mimic  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:41):**  an ecosystem. And when you do that, you definitely can be more productive. It won't look the  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:47):**  same because you're not, you cannot compare it directly with a soy crop, you know, or  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:51):**  a wheat crop and say, this is what we're doing is we're creating, you know, potentially would  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:18:55):**  be having a diversified range of outputs. So it's more difficult to measure, but overall  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:00):**  your livestock numbers are likely to be able to increase. And if you're an arable farmer,  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:05):**  and that's not my specialism, so, but there are arable farmers, people like Gabe Brown  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:10):**  who are using these principles and practices to the highest degree are significantly producing  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:15):**  more, you know, but they're producing a range of different foods. And then if you get into  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:19):**  the conversation around, okay, well, nutrient density, should we just be comparing calories?  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:23):**  I mean, you could easily say, okay, well, if you have this intensive production system,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:28):**  then maybe we could produce more calories, although I don't agree that's possible either.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:33):**  But calories are meaningless. Really what humans need is really good nutrition. So you  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:37):**  need to be focused on what's the quality of that. And is it sustainable, you know, to  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:41):**  that landscape? You know, we use it, we're giving a false choice really by saying intensive  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:45):**  agriculture can produce more because it's producing more this year, but over a series  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:50):**  of 10 years where you're building in crop failures and bad years, you know, is it truly  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:55):**  sustainable and is it going to go beyond that? Are we going to be able to keep producing  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:19:58):**  food for 50 years on that intensive system? And in my experience, that's an absolute no,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:03):**  because our soil carbon levels are being depleted. You know, the problems with insect pests are  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:08):**  getting worse. Worms are no longer working in farming. We've got huge issues that are  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:12):**  just not going to allow us to continue in that same way. So it's a false choice.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:16):**  What you're trying to do is to go back to looking at what the root cause is rather than  
**[0:20:21-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:21):**  simply treating symptom after symptom after symptom.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:24):**  Yeah, completely. So in modern farming, we're doing nothing but treating symptoms. And as  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:28):**  you quite rightly say, and that costs a huge amount of money. So if you go back to the  
**[0:20:31-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:31):**  root cause of nearly every problem, it's in soil health. So if you have gradually depleted  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:37):**  your carbon and all of the biology, all the microorganisms in your soil, then you've broken  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:42):**  down the nutritional pathway that feeds the plant. And as soon as you do that, you have  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:45):**  to feed the plant with fossil fuel, fossil fuel derived nutrients, which are hugely problematic  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:51):**  for lots of reasons. And I'm very, very costly to the farmer. But that plant becomes quite  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:20:56):**  sick because you are not providing the massive range of nutrients that needs to be healthy  
**[0:21:00-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:00):**  and disease resistant. And we've got so used to that. We think it's normal for things to  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:03):**  get diseases all the time. And then that plant is sick. So it needs pesticides and herbicides.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:08):**  We need to kind of control everything and treat that. And then whatever is eating that  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:12):**  plant, whether it be us or an animal, is not getting the range of nutrients it needs. So  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:17):**  we then have to treat our animals with worms and all sorts of applications to try and prevent  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:22):**  them getting sick and give them minerals that they could have got from the soil, but that's  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:26):**  broken down. So, you know, you're then treating all of these symptoms and that's where we  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:30):**  get to. And we've become really good at trying to manage those symptoms. But ultimately,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:34):**  what we need to do is go back, right back and strip the whole system down and say, how  
**[0:21:37-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:37):**  do we rebuild a truly balanced, ecologically, you know, sound system that's going to continue  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:45):**  to produce food long term and that food is going to be incredibly healthy for everybody.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:50):**  OK, so my kids love playing with Lego, and it seems to me that many modern farm systems  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:21:58):**  are like vast Lego castles where new wings and turrets have been built, requiring new  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:02):**  props and stilts to be added. And the whole thing has just become astonishingly unwieldy.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:08):**  So what Caroline is talking about is stripping the Lego model back to basics and rebuilding  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:13):**  the foundations from the roots up. But can you do this while the Lego castle continues  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:18):**  to function? And if we strip away my laboured Lego metaphor, can you shift to regenerative  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:24):**  food production while continuing to farm throughout the transition?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:29):**  You can, and some people are extremely good at that. I think there's a period we've got  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:33):**  a window of opportunity where it's easier to transition into one of these models if  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:39):**  you give yourself a bit of breathing space. And how I like to work with farmers is to  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:43):**  say, OK, you've got to if you actually look at where your profitability is, it's very rarely  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:47):**  in the actual production. Most farmers in this country are making very little money  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:50):**  out of their sheep operation or their cattle operation alone when you're looking at considering  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:22:55):**  those input costs. So with that in mind and the fact that a lot of the percentage of an  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:00):**  income comes from subsidy, and we've got a few years left where we know that's going  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:03):**  to be the case, I think this is the time to say, right, let's strip back some of the numbers,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:10):**  strip back some of the complexity in your system. So often we have to create big areas  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:13):**  of rest ahead of us. So we've got areas of grass to go into. And in order to do that,  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:19):**  if you've got lots of different enterprises and lots of different animal operations, it's  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:24):**  really hard to create that big gap. So what we often do is trying and help them simplify  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:29):**  the operation. So, you know, how do we get down to sort of one beef operation, one sheep  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:33):**  operation and not be crossing them and separating them all into little groups all the time.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:39):**  And at the same time, we need to be, you know, looking at getting rid of all those input  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:44):**  costs and resetting the system so that we can actually go into this brand new world,  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:50):**  essentially, of managing your farm like an ecosystem.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:53):**  You mentioned when you were talking about cattle and sheep, can you have regenerative  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:23:58):**  systems that don't include livestock?  
**[0:24:00-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:00):**  I think the principle is that all ecosystems would, you wouldn't be separating out animals  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:08):**  from plants. That just doesn't happen in a natural system. So with that in mind, it doesn't  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:14):**  really make sense to try. So if you want to have natural mineral cycling and you want  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:18):**  the soil to be healthy and minerals to be turned from sort of, you know, vegetation  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:24):**  into back into nutrients that can feed plants again, and you want all of the complexity,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:29):**  you need to be able to not have big booms of pests and issues with insects and all those  
**[0:24:34-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:34):**  problems. I think you need a truly integrated system.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:41):**  Well the cock rule says that that's all we've got time for. Has vegan become a dirty  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:46):**  word? No, or at least it shouldn't have. But there's no doubt that society needs  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:51):**  to rediscover a little respect for the choices people make about what they eat. We won't  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:24:56):**  get very far if we start judging people for eating either a nut cutlet or a beef burger.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:25:01):**  And more than that, fixating on people's diets is coming at this from entirely the  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:25:06):**  wrong direction. Instead we need to look at the land. What can each parcel of land, and  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:25:11):**  the landscape around it more broadly, best produce in balance with nature? Of course,  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:25:17):**  that raises more questions and more challenges, but those are subjects for other programmes.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:25:23):**  No one ever said that averting environmental catastrophe was going to be easy.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-vegan-a-dirty-word-e9vtat#t=0:25:27):**  Well that's it. Thank you for listening. And if you've enjoyed the programme, then

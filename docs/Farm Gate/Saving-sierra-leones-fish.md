### Farm Gate  (Mon, 31 May 2021 15:49:14)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. Our current mini-series about ocean  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:10):**  food is responding to sea-spiracy. The Netflix film concluded that there's no such thing  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:15):**  as sustainable fishing. Well, that's a pretty blunt statement and one that fails to recognise  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:21):**  the enormous efforts that are being made by so many people. In previous programmes we've  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:25):**  discussed the challenges of overfishing, taken a critical look at aquaculture, spoken to  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:29):**  the Marine Stewardship Council about their blue eco-label supply chain, and learned about  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:34):**  how the Isle of Man brought its shellfish fisheries back from the brink of collapse.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:39):**  In this programme we visit Sierra Leone and look at how this West African country has  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:44):**  worked with international stakeholders to address overfishing and to assert its marine  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:49):**  authority, particularly in the waters inside its six-mile wide inshore exclusion zone.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:00:55):**  Salu Sanko is the coordinator of the World Bank-funded West African Regional Fisheries  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:00):**  Programme in Sierra Leone. Phil Gorn is an advisor to the fisheries programme and a former  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:05):**  fisheries minister for Isle of Man Government, which has made substantial contributions through  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:10):**  its international aid budget. Hello both. Hi Finnlow. Hi Finnlow. Salu, what's the purpose  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:17):**  of the West African Regional Fisheries Programme? What's the problem that it's seeking to address?  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:22):**  Thank you Finnlow. The West African Regional Fisheries Programme was not a project like  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:28):**  the traditional project that the ministry used to benefit from. This was a programme  
**[0:01:32-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:32):**  of support that was structured to be delivered in three phases. Phase one was to look at  
**[0:01:39-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:39):**  governance structures and reform these governance structures towards achieving sustainable fisheries.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:46):**  Once that is achieved, then the next step was looking at investments through private  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:52):**  sector involvement to see how the fisheries can better benefit Sierra Leone and the West  
**[0:01:59-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:01:59):**  Africa region as a whole. So the first consideration was to look at what are the existing governance  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:06):**  structures, how can this be made more efficient? And then the next thing was we had a challenge  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:12):**  of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, both from within the country and from outsiders  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:18):**  who were dominating the industrial fisheries sector. And at the time, we were estimating  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:25):**  that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is causing the country to lose about $29 million  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:32):**  annually. And so this was a big challenge for the fisheries sector. So the project had  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:37):**  set up to actually address illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, to look at the governance  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:44):**  structures and bring about reforms that would ensure efficiency in the management of the  
**[0:02:50-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:50):**  fisheries.  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:51):**  Thank you, Sally. That's a fantastic overview. Phil, if I could just come to you. The Isle  
**[0:02:54-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:54):**  of Man, how and why did you and the Isle of Man get involved?  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:02:57):**  Well, it was a very lucky series of circumstances, really. I was fisheries minister at the time.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:04):**  My fisheries director was getting itchy feet and he noticed a secondment that had been  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:09):**  suggested with the World Bank in Sierra Leone for this very project, the fisheries project.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:16):**  So he asked me, would I be willing to let him go for a few months? And I said, yes.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:21):**  And of course, he returned very enthusiastic and said, there's so much more that we could  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:26):**  do here. The Isle of Man could help quite significantly. And really, from that point  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:32):**  on, I was hooked. We had a redundant patrol vessel and we thought, well, we can certainly  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:39):**  help with that. So it was arranged for the redundant patrol vessel to be shipped out  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:45):**  to Freetown. I made a visit and during that visit, I was able to assist with the World  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:52):**  Bank team and Sally with a few ideas. Came back to the Isle of Man and said, look, we  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:03:58):**  could fund a vessel monitoring system. We could provide some support by way of capacity  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:03):**  building. And really, for the next four or five years, we put a load of support in.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:09):**  Thanks, Phil. We're going to get more into the detail of that as we go forward. Sally,  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:14):**  coming back to you, when you started in 2010, that's over a decade ago now, how were you  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:19):**  able to assess the state that the fishery was in? And not just the state of the fishery  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:25):**  in terms of the economics, but also the state of the marine environment itself?  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:29):**  It was a difficult thing to do to assess the fishes as a whole at the time because there  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:36):**  were very few studies that had been conducted before and there were very few information  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:42):**  in terms of the data available to us. Data that was collected had not been analysed at  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:48):**  the time and we really had to start from a very uncertain situation. So this was where  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:04:55):**  we actually had to hire a lot of expertise. For instance, we hired the then director of  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:01):**  fishes in the Isle of Man to develop for us a sustainable fishes MCS system, monitoring  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:08):**  control and surveillance system. And then we hired the marine resource MRAG, marine  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:15):**  resource assessment group in the UK to do a stock assessment for us so that we see exactly  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:21):**  how much are we currently taking from our waters and how much can we take on a sustainable  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:27):**  basis. So we do fish stock assessment with the sustainable fishes management. We also  
**[0:05:33-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:33):**  hired another German guy to do for us a strategy for community fishes management system. So  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:42):**  we had relied mostly on international experts to actually do some studies for us.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:48):**  Just thinking for a moment about that stock assessment, in broad terms, what did it discover?  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:05:54):**  Well, the stock assessment had indicated that already there were some species that are now  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:00):**  currently fully exploited. There are a few other species that are already being over  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:06):**  exploited and there were a few species, particularly the pelagic stocks that are still very healthy  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:12):**  at the time. So we were then now going to look at the options of what to manage, where  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:19):**  to manage and things like that. And so the idea of the marine protected areas, the idea  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:25):**  of community surveillance, the idea of strengthening the surveillance capacity of the ministry  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:32):**  and the monitoring capacity of the ministry came on very strongly. And this is where we  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:37):**  were very happy when the Isle of Man came in to help us with the patrol boat. At the  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:42):**  time we were still developing technical specs to procure our own boats. We didn't have any  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:49):**  boats. So the Isle of Man came in handy and gave us a boat. They also came in and gifted  
**[0:06:54-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:06:54):**  us 60 units of transponders that we were now using to monitor vessels and be able to tell  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:01):**  where they are at any particular time.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:03):**  It's interesting to hear that, you know, that there were some species that were underexploited  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:08):**  as well as species that were overexploited. Now, if I look down from Google Earth onto  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:13):**  Sierra Leone and its coastline, I see blue. I don't get any sense of what the underwater  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:18):**  landscape is like. And I wonder if you could just sort of help to draw us a picture in  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:22):**  terms of how varied that marine landscape is.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:25):**  Interestingly, in the northern flank of the coastal waters of Sierra Leone are very shallow  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:31):**  we have a region in the oceans we call the continental shelf, which is an area that is  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:36):**  below 200 metres deep. And in the northern part of Sierra Leone, that is from Freetown  
**[0:07:41-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:41):**  going towards Guinea, the continental shelf is very wide, about 80 kilometres. And that  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:48):**  is a very rich area for fisheries because a lot of the nutrients that are washed on  
**[0:07:54-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:07:54):**  land from rivers are brought into this area. And because of that rich nutrients, you have  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:01):**  a lot of productivity, primary productivity, photosynthesis is taking place. And so phytoplankton,  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:07):**  zooplankton are in abundance. Therefore, the fish are drifted towards that for feeding.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:12):**  In the southern end of the country towards the border with Liberia, the continental shelf  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:18):**  is very narrow. It's only about 13 kilometres compared to 80 kilometres in the north. And  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:24):**  so there the species composition is different because although there are rivers bringing  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:30):**  a lot of nutrients as well, the sea gets very deep very quickly. And therefore, artisanal  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:37):**  fishers for instance, are not able to venture too far out at sea because of the danger of  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:42):**  drowning and things like that. So this is the kind of bathymetry.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:47):**  That's so interesting. And Phil, Sierra Leone's fishing industry is essentially an artisanal  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:52):**  industry as Sally just commented. So that's, you know, it's a lot of wooden boats from  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:08:57):**  Sierra Leone's own fishers. If it wasn't for the really big boats and the industrial scale  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:02):**  approach to fishing that's coming in towards Sierra Leone from China, Russia, Korea, France  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:08):**  and Spain, etc. Do you think there would ever have been a sustainability problem for Sierra  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:14):**  Leone's fishery? Well, obviously, I mean, you rightly identified  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:17):**  the industrial fishery is a significant problem for Sierra Leone in that inevitably it takes  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:24):**  a lot more fish. But there is I mean, there's some good elements the industrial fishery  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:28):**  you know, the further out off the continental shelf out to the 200 mile limit, there's some  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:34):**  fishing taking place out there which the artisanal fishery couldn't actually engage with. But  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:40):**  there has been a significant problem with the industrial fishery fishing too close to  
**[0:09:45-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:45):**  the shore. And that has caused problems. It's arguable that actually because of the significant  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:52):**  growth in population in Sierra Leone that there would have been an increasing pressure  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:09:58):**  anyway in relation to the artisanal fishery because the more people there are to feed,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:03):**  the more fishermen will want to go out to catch fish added to which of course, there's  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:08):**  considerable poverty in the country. And if fishing, the artisanal fishery is seen as  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:13):**  a successful industry actually get a reasonable living, then people are going to want to get  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:18):**  into that industry. So, I think there was an inevitability to that. But when you add  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:23):**  onto that the fact that external markets are buying fish from the artisanal fishery, which  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:30):**  means that the people of Sierra Leone is not the only market, but there's also this external  
**[0:10:36-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:36):**  and lucrative markets as well that has led to significant pressures on the artisanal  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:42):**  fishery as well.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:43):**  So, let's split that into two, I suppose. Let's look at the industrial aspect first,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:48):**  how to deal with those boats coming into Sierra Leone's waters. And then perhaps a bit later,  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:53):**  we can come back to the population growth and the success of the artisanal fishing industry  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:10:59):**  sector and look at the potential impacts of that. So, for now, Salut, clearly one of the  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:04):**  biggest challenges that Phil mentioned there was that taking back control of the inshore  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:09):**  exclusion zone. I mean, you talked about this a little bit before, but I wonder if you could  
**[0:11:14-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:14):**  go into a bit more detail about how you went about doing this.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:17):**  Firstly, the control of the industrial sector was largely managed by the introduction of  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:25):**  the vessel monitoring system. Because as you already pointed out earlier that if we had  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:30):**  left the artisanal fishery to fish within the continental shelf area and all the industrial  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:36):**  vessels going far out at sea, probably would not be too worried about sustainability in  
**[0:11:42-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:42):**  the sector. But then these artisanal industrial fleets started coming inshore, particularly  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:49):**  towards the south to actually fish for themselves fish species, which are very expensive, high  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:11:56):**  value species. And so, there was this conflict between the industrial and the artisanal.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:01):**  And this was illegal, the big ships coming in at that point, that was illegal, was it?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:05):**  It was illegal because our law says they cannot fish within six miles offshore. And so, they  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:11):**  should have stayed out of the inshore exclusion zone where they were exploiting at the time  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:17):**  our incapacity to monitor and the incapacity to actually arrest them if they do come there.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:25):**  But with the introduction of the vessel monitoring system, we were not able to actually see them  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:31):**  live in real time if they move into the IPZ with a monitoring system sitting in front  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:37):**  of a computer screen. And then of course, we had the Isle of Man vessel that we can  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:42):**  use actually to launch a quick patrol and arrest them.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:46):**  How big is this vessel?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:48):**  Around 16 metres long.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:51):**  Okay, so it's a sizeable boat.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:53):**  Yes, it's fairly big boat relative to all the other craft that we had at the time. It  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:12:58):**  was a very successful operation. We had also intelligence reports, people telling us that  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:04):**  boats are within the IEZ and so we can launch quick surveillance patrol and actually apprehend  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:11):**  them within the act.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:13):**  So tell me what happens when you go out with the fisheries vessel and you arrest them in  
**[0:13:18-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:18):**  the act, what happens to them then?  
**[0:13:20-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:20):**  We had to find a lot of them. Within 2010 to 2012, we were able to raise more than $3  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:28):**  million in fines from these operations. And this sent a very clear message to a lot of  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:34):**  industrial operators that Sierra Leone is no longer the place to go and take fish freely.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:40):**  So when we started arresting and fining some of them, we had a rush for acquiring a fishing  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:45):**  licence in Sierra Leone at the time. And then revenue from the fisheries sector started  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:51):**  climbing up, jumping up. Before this programme, for instance, the revenue from the fisheries  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:13:57):**  was around $600,000 a year, which was around 4 billion lunes. And then later on, it started  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:04):**  growing until we went up to over 100 billion.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:08):**  Can you give us that as a percentage of GDP, Salil?  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:11):**  It's about 12% now.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:13):**  And that's climbed from where?  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:14):**  From 9% to 12% now.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:18):**  So very successful. And I'm just, I don't want to obsess about this, but I'm very interested  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:22):**  in what happens to these boats that get arrested out there. So what I'm imagining is that  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:27):**  you're somehow managing to persuade or pull a Chinese or a Russian boat back to shore  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:33):**  in Freetown and that they're then stranded there. They're not allowed to leave until  
**[0:14:37-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:37):**  the fine's been paid. Is that right?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:39):**  Yes, correct. That was what we used to do. And interestingly, at the time, they were  
**[0:14:43-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:43):**  so caught on the axe that they didn't argue at all. So we had what we call administrative  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:49):**  fines. We were caught doing this. Is that correct? Yes, I did that. Can you pay this  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:54):**  fine and then they pay? And at the time, of course, the fines were really very reasonable.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:14:58):**  So they didn't have much trouble paying the fines.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:02):**  So Salil, the programme's been running for 10 years now. You've talked about some of  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:06):**  the successes there, but in general terms, do you think that it's been worth the investment,  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:11):**  it's been worth the time that's been put into it, it's been successful?  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:14):**  Very much so. Firstly, this programme has introduced a lot of transparency into the  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:19):**  sector. It has improved the lives of the additional fishermen in some respects. And it has thrown  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:25):**  light into the fact that there is money in fishing. Before now, we didn't know that there  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:30):**  is money in fishing. But now the government and people of Syria are benefiting much more  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:35):**  from this sector.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:36):**  Phil, I'm curious because Salil's already talked about, you know, the way that the Isle  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:40):**  of Man helped with fisheries vessel, with transponders and that sort of thing. I'm wondering  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:45):**  in terms of the governance of the fishery, what your experience was going over to Freetown,  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:51):**  to Sierra Leone, what you thought about the governance there and how, whether you were  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:15:55):**  able to make suggestions about how to streamline the way that Sierra Leone and its government  
**[0:16:02-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:02):**  were approaching these challenges?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:03):**  Yes, certainly, obviously, the technology was really very important. But we were also  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:08):**  able to give advice on how we do things in the Isle of Man. I mean, the Isle of Man is  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:14):**  not that similar to Sierra Leone in that some of the bigger models of how to control fisheries  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:20):**  don't work because Isle of Man is relatively small. Sierra Leone's administration is relatively  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:25):**  small and very sort of threadbare. I think it's fair to say, you know, the officers are  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:31):**  not paid a very significant amount of money. They struggle with equipment and the technology.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:36):**  So the fact that we were able to help them with that, and also perhaps to advise a little  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:40):**  bit on how you would go about administering your fishery with a much more constrained  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:45):**  budget and constrained resource, I think that was, well, I hope it was helpful anyway.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:51):**  You were suggesting when we spoke before the podcast that there were some mechanisms that  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:16:55):**  had been set up in Sierra Leone which actually compounded the problems that existed.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:00):**  Well, certainly, in my view, the World Bank approach had been very much based on the,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:08):**  in an ideal world where resource was no object, how would you go about managing this fishery?  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:15):**  And there didn't seem to be an awful lot of experience or understanding of the intense  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:20):**  pressures that come on both in terms of the general administration and in terms of the  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:25):**  politics. You know, the minister may have signed up entirely to everything the World  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:30):**  Bank was saying, but the minister then had to translate the policies into something that  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:36):**  would be understandable to the people of Sierra Leone. And that in itself is quite a difficult  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:41):**  thing to do, but added to which, you know, the demands that for separation of powers  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:47):**  in a number of different areas, whilst in theory works exceptionally well, in practice  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:53):**  in a relatively small jurisdiction with very limited resource, you have to be a little  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:17:58):**  bit pragmatic about how you go about managing these things. I think I was able to give a  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:03):**  little bit of advice on that from our practical experience in the Isle of Man.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:07):**  I think one of the examples you were using was about license holders.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:11):**  So each vessel in Sierra Leone has to, by law, have an agent if they aren't Sierra  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:18):**  Leone National owned. And I don't think any of the industrial fisheries, or at least  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:22):**  if there are any, there are very few in number, are actually any of the vessels owned by Sierra  
**[0:18:27-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:27):**  Leone National. So they all have agents. Also, there's an observer on each vessel as well.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:33):**  The idea of the agent is so that the vessel owner can deal through the agent with the  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:37):**  Sierra Leone authorities, which is really very important for the people in Sierra Leone.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:44):**  Unfortunately, what that does, though, is create another layer of bureaucracy and cost  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:51):**  to the whole system, which means that perhaps the money that could be going to ensure good  
**[0:18:57-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:18:57):**  government can be afforded ends up going into to fund the expenses of the agents.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:04):**  And presumably this agent, it could be the same agent for every vessel?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:08):**  Potentially, yes.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:09):**  And what about the observers that you were talking about on board?  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:12):**  Well, I think the people in Sierra Leone aren't paid a huge amount of money. The catches that  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:18):**  they were monitoring are very significant. So you can see if you are several miles out  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:24):**  to sea and you note discrepancies in the way things are being reported, it's very difficult  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:31):**  for you as the only person on that vessel who isn't part of the crew, but you're there  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:36):**  as a separate agent to monitor things. It must be very difficult, indeed, I know it  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:41):**  is very difficult for some of these people to be able to provide accurate reports when  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:48):**  effectively the vessel owner is putting, or the captain is putting pressure on you to  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:52):**  perhaps give a lower tally than what's actually been caught.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:19:58):**  And presumably with the sort of money that's involved in some of these bigger catches,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:03):**  that could have been quite a dangerous position for an observer to be in.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:05):**  Yes, it is potentially dangerous. It was always something that we were concerned about in  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:12):**  any of the discussions we were having. And I think indeed the ministry officials recognised  
**[0:20:17-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:17):**  that this could be a problem.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:19):**  Sallio, do you think that over the last few years, some of these challenges, some of these  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:23):**  problems that have arisen that you've been able to deal with or recommend that the government  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:28):**  deal with in different ways?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:30):**  Yes, to some level. For instance, the filaments on the problems or challenges of the observers  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:36):**  on board the vessel. In the past, there are instances when observers are thrown out of  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:42):**  boats and they would have to swim to safety for themselves. We've had reports of beatings  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:47):**  of observers on board vessels. But what made it worse, in fact, was that these observers  
**[0:20:52-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:20:52):**  were actually paid by the companies through the agents. And so they really had some kind  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:00):**  of obligation towards the companies rather than the government that they were representing  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:05):**  on board the vessels. That has now changed. The government still requires the companies  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:12):**  or the operators to pay for the observer services or they are not paying the observers directly.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:18):**  They are paying each aspect of the licence fee and then the government pays the observers.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:24):**  And of course, their pay package has now improved to an extent that, in fact, some of the observers  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:30):**  are now earning more than the fisheries officer, which is another challenge that we're trying  
**[0:21:34-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:34):**  to look at. We tried several times to convince the bank, as Phil actually mentioned earlier,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:42):**  the bank was looking at their own policies. You cannot pay extra amount of money to fisheries  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:49):**  officers because they already have a contract with government. And of course, this contract  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:21:55):**  with government is not really paying them an awful lot. And many of them are really  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:00):**  basically surviving. And so if you are asking somebody to manage a resource that is worth  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:05):**  millions of dollars and you are paying that individual maybe 100 or 200 dollars at most  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:11):**  a month, certainly you have a challenge there that everybody would know is a very big one.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:17):**  And this may be naive, but I mean, is it possible for observers to, you know, wear body cams  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:23):**  or something like that so that they themselves are monitored and their safety is checked?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:28):**  Yes, it is possible. Of course, when you have laws that are enforced and the operators know  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:35):**  that if they do anything to the observers, they would face the full force of the law.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:40):**  They would never do that. They would never try it. That's one important thing. And in  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:44):**  the past, they used to do that and they go scotfully. Nothing happened to them. These  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:48):**  days, it's different, completely different. If you mistakenly touch any observer on body  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:54):**  or vessel, you will be grounded for life. You will never have a deficiency of unity.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:22:58):**  I just wonder, Salih, if you could talk to me about your experience of working with the  
**[0:23:02-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:02):**  World Bank, how you found that.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:04):**  Well, I think the World Bank's conditionalities or policies seem to be applied as if the whole  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:11):**  world or all the nations of the world are like the same. Different countries have different  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:17):**  cultures, traditions and different economic developments in terms of levels of development.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:23):**  And so if you try to implement policies that are one size fits all, we would really struggle  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:30):**  to succeed in some countries where other countries are making progress. For instance, some countries  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:36):**  are already, the governments are paying people very well. Therefore, if you bring your projects  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:42):**  there, the project officers and the government officials will not have any problems because  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:47):**  they are almost at the same level. Their take home pay is almost at the same level. When  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:51):**  Sierra Leone, for instance, where a project officer is paid very well, maybe 20 times  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:23:57):**  what the officials officer is getting. I mean, for those two people to work amicably and  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:04):**  try to bring progress following the rules equally is a big challenge. And sometimes  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:10):**  you find it very difficult as a project officer paid by World Bank to really get the full  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:15):**  support of the ministry staff that are paid by governments because they would think, oh,  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:22):**  he's behaving that way because he's well paid compared to us.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:26):**  World Bank would actually be looking at which country they're dealing with and which policies  
**[0:24:31-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:31):**  would help successfully implement their programme.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:34):**  It's really interesting to hear about it from Sierra Leone's perspective. And Phil,  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:39):**  you've said that you felt that there was a tendency for international institutions not  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:45):**  always to value local knowledge and experience as much as perhaps they should have done.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:50):**  I wonder, looking at it from the outside, what was your experience of the whole thing?  
**[0:24:54-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:24:54):**  It was absolutely clear to me that the World Bank team didn't really appreciate the difficulties  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:02):**  of the people they were trying to work with. There didn't seem to be anywhere near the  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:07):**  amount of empathy that I would have expected. The expectation was that if World Bank sent  
**[0:25:13-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:13):**  out an email with documents in on the Friday, that the officers would spend their weekend  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:19):**  working on this and have a response ready for Monday morning, assuming, of course, that  
**[0:25:23-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:23):**  these officers were well paid and were prepared to do overtime and prepared to give up a lot  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:29):**  of their time. The reality was that the officers were not getting paid anywhere near the amount  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:34):**  of money they should be getting paid. Now, some of that is an issue, an internal issue  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:39):**  with the government, because as Salut mentioned, the return to government from the fisheries  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:44):**  is now significant and it could afford to pay its staff a reasonable salary. But when  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:51):**  you have all the other commitments of government or issues to try and deal with, healthcare  
**[0:25:56-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:25:56):**  systems, education systems, what have you, when a large amount of revenue starts coming  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:01):**  in, you're probably not going to be inclined to spend it on fisheries enforcement officers.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:08):**  And you're probably more inclined to want to spend it on new schools and hospitals.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:12):**  So I get the politics of it. And I think sometimes this was absent from the World Bank thinking  
**[0:26:18-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:18):**  that in some way, because the revenue was coming in, well, that's obvious then, you  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:24):**  just need to pay your officers properly. Well, that works if the fisheries ministry existed  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:29):**  on its own without any of the other competing pressures of government. But quite clearly  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:34):**  that's not the case. The obvious reason why the World Bank didn't make as much progress  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:39):**  perhaps as it should have done was the issue that Salut has raised there. As the World  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:45):**  Bank paid officer, he was getting paid substantially more than the people he needed to work with  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:50):**  him in the ministry. Now, even with the most understanding people in the world, they're  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:26:56):**  going to have a difficulty with that. And indeed, the officers working in the ministry  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:01):**  in very senior positions were working with very old and outdated equipment. They weren't  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:06):**  getting paid a reasonable salary. So it's not going to motivate them. However, the World  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:12):**  Bank rule says you can't provide the support to those officers that they need.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:17):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:19):**  and perhaps you're in a better position because you're not in Sierra Leone, to sort  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:23):**  of be quite straight about this. You'd expect that the World Bank would be used to handling  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:28):**  these kinds of relationships. And the fact that it isn't doing it in Sierra Leone implies  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:33):**  that it possibly isn't doing that elsewhere as well. And I wonder, is it a sort of a white  
**[0:27:38-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:38):**  saviour mentality that's there that says we know better than this country that's relatively  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:45):**  poor in comparison with other bigger countries that are funding the work that we do? Is it  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:51):**  that? Or is it that there is just institutional pressure within the World Bank itself that  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:27:56):**  leads to a kind of institutional ignorance when people in the UK or the USA, for example,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:03):**  that are based there are dealing with people in poorer countries in smaller administrations?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:07):**  Well, I think there's two elements. I think there is a certain amount of where from the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:12):**  West, where the whites faces and we know best. There's a certain amount of that. I don't  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:16):**  think it's quite as overt as that, but it is there. I think the bigger issue, though,  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:22):**  for me, and you know, I think we've picked a bit on the World Bank here, because obviously  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:26):**  it's a World Bank programme. But in my experience, the same could be said of any of the major  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:31):**  international donors. The issue is more about they have rules that they have to apply, because  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:37):**  they have donors themselves, you know, various nations of the world fund these projects,  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:43):**  so they have to be accountable to their donors. So they create a one size fits all approach  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:49):**  to how they manage the money. They have to, to a certain extent, because, you know, Sierra  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:28:53):**  Leone, there's no secret, is quite high up on the lead table of corrupt countries, as  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:00):**  indeed are most of the countries I think that international donors are trying to help. So  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:05):**  there has to be some control over the finance. I totally get that. But there doesn't seem  
**[0:29:10-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:10):**  to be any flexibility to allow for the obvious situation on the ground in the case of this  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:17):**  project, which was the Ministry can't pay its officers enough, and you're not able to  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:22):**  pay them anything. And as a result of that, most of the rest of the objectives of the  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:26):**  project struggled. So I think I can understand where the pressures come from. I can understand  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:32):**  that the whole need for transparency and integrity of the financial process needs to be properly  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:38):**  done. But the total lack of flexibility meant that this project was almost doomed not to  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:45):**  succeed.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:46):**  And yet, despite all that, Salu, it clearly has succeeded. I mean, you gave me the statistic  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:50):**  earlier on of the fishery and the amount that it's making in terms of GDP has gone up from  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:29:56):**  nine percent to 12 percent. So that's obviously an economic boon in terms of Sierra Leone's  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:01):**  fishery. What about the fish themselves? What's the impact on sustainability of the fishery?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:07):**  Have those stocks that were over-exploited been able to bounce back over the last 10  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:11):**  years?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:12):**  Well, I tell people that when you manage the fisheries, you're looking at sustainability.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:18):**  You're not really managing the fish in the water because they will not even listen to  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:23):**  you. You're actually managing the people that depend on the fish, that are harvesting the  
**[0:30:28-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:28):**  fish, that are exploiting the resource. And so if you are able to put the people that  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:35):**  depend on the fisheries under control, including the managers themselves, then you would go  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:41):**  a long way to succeed. And what we have done over the years is to, first of all, improve  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:47):**  the capacity of the managers in terms of knowledge, the tools that they're using. For instance,  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:54):**  now they can sit in an air-conditioned room and monitor the vessels 24-7. That's never  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:30:59):**  happened before. And so that's a huge success. So without going to sea, you would actually  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:05):**  be able to see. Even if you decide that I cannot monitor for 24-7, you go and sleep.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:10):**  In the morning, you are able to track back all the vessels overnight or one week or one  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:15):**  month earlier to see where they have been before. So that's a very huge success. We  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:20):**  also now have fairly accurate data of what the industrial fishing fleet are taking and  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:27):**  what the artisanal fishermen are taking. Without that information, you will not be able to  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:32):**  tell whether they are taking within the sustainable maximum yield or not. And so these are the  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:39):**  first few steps that we have succeeded in establishing. And therefore, we hope with  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:43):**  additional support and continued sustained support, we'll be able to achieve others.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:49):**  For instance, there was a plan to actually look at increasing the contribution of fisheries  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:31:54):**  into the local economy by actually adding value to the fish that is caught instead of  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:00):**  just catching the fish like they're doing now out at sea, tranship it and it goes. And  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:05):**  sometimes we don't even know how much has been transhipped accurately. We now are thinking  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:10):**  of actually getting a fish harbor where all vessels will be required to come and actually  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:15):**  declare their catch and decide what to land in the local market, what to go out as export  
**[0:32:22-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:22):**  and what can be processed into some other value added products.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:26):**  Let me come back on to that in just a second, because there's a whole big issue in itself  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:31):**  that I want to talk to you about. But just before we do, I want to talk about the way  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:34):**  that your fishery is managed on the ground. And my understanding is that the Sierra Leone  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:40):**  fishery isn't just one big management association, that it's actually broken up into 37 community  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:45):**  management associations. Why so many and how does that work?  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:49):**  We have noted as a ministry that managing the fisheries or managing the people, as I  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:54):**  said, it is not the fish in the water that we are managing. Rather, we are managing the  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:32:58):**  people that depend on the fisheries and managing people at Sulima or at Yolimu where we are  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:03):**  from, Freetown, would be very difficult. So what we have done is to set up small, small  
**[0:33:07-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:07):**  management committees that would manage the people in their local communities. So how  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:13):**  to access the resource and how to manage the fishes access in those local communities.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:20):**  And then we'll coordinate with all the other communities to see how to move forward and  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:26):**  we'll share experiences from the different communities. This is what we decided to do  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:31):**  so that you are managed by your own people in your own local area. We are moving towards  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:37):**  what we call territorial use right fishery. So you manage what is within your territory,  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:42):**  your adjacent water body or water space and the people that are dependent on that. We  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:47):**  have a very complex fisheries, which is a multi-species fisheries and all the people  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:53):**  in a particular community are targeting different species based on the gear they are using.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:33:58):**  And so management of our role objective is to ensure that we don't deplete the stocks.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:06):**  You may have situations where some of the stocks are actually over-pressured, whilst  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:12):**  others are less so because of the preferences of the fishermen in those local communities.  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:18):**  But the important thing here is that within those communities, we have what you call MCS  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:24):**  committees. We have the environment committees. We have the bylaws development and enforcement  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:30):**  committees. These small, small committees are actually responsible for some aspects  
**[0:34:36-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:36):**  of management. And of course, you have a structure they call an executive of the CMA that will  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:43):**  look at other issues and they will be representing their community in management trainings and  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:49):**  meetings that are conducted either in Freetown or at the district level.  
**[0:34:53-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:34:53):**  Now, Salu, you mentioned a moment ago your kind of priorities for the future of Sierra  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:00):**  Leone's fishery. And you were talking there about wanting to increase the value of the  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:05):**  contribution of the fisheries to the Sierra Leone economy rather than Sierra Leone contributing  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:11):**  to the Chinese economy or the Russian economy or the French economy by having the fish taken  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:16):**  away. And the need to add value. And you talked about the need for a new harbour. Now, you'll  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:22):**  know that recent press reports have expressed some concern about a new harbour project that's  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:28):**  being funded by the Chinese. I wonder if you could just briefly tell me what the project  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:33):**  is and why you think it's important to Sierra Leone.  
**[0:35:36-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:35:36):**  The project is not a new initiative of government, as you may have seen in the press recently.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:06):**  How  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:19):**  support Sierra Leone for a harbour construction at Kiseido  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:23):**  here. Just by the time this program was going to take off,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:27):**  we had a rebel war which lasted for like 10 or 11 years.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:31):**  So that one never came back.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:33):**  And then we had the World Bank coming in to help for a fish  
**[0:36:36-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:36):**  harbour again in 2010.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:39):**  And we tried a level that we identified more return for this  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:44):**  harbour.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:45):**  We are going to do some land reclamation and the like.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:47):**  For some reason, again, we lost that opportunity because of  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:51):**  some mis-procurement issues.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:52):**  And we lost that opportunity.  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:54):**  Again, we started preparing a phase two of the World Bank  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:36:57):**  program where we wanted to include a fish harbour,  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:02):**  a landing site at Tumbu, which is a very important fishing  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:05):**  community, a landing site at Konark 3D,  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:08):**  and fixing the road from Konark 3D to the airport to facilitate  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:12):**  fish export through Europe, through air and things like that.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:15):**  And so, again, something happened which we cannot  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:19):**  clearly say what happened, but I think it may be connected  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:23):**  with Donald Trump having a different foreign policy  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:26):**  during his administration.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:28):**  And now we have another opportunity of the Chinese giving  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:32):**  us a grant for the construction of a platform.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:36):**  $55 million is seen as a lot of money,  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:39):**  but the work involved in that will tell you that that money  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:43):**  is only to do a platform where a private sector can then come in  
**[0:37:47-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:47):**  and actually participate in building factories,  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:51):**  maybe a dock side where they can be building better boats  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:55):**  instead of cutting all our trees to construct local boats.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:37:59):**  Maybe we would have a place there to do fibreglass boats  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:02):**  for fishing.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:03):**  We can have a place to repair trawlers for fishing.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:06):**  We can have probably a canning factory and other fish  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:10):**  processing facilities within that.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:12):**  But these would all come from private sector involvement,  
**[0:38:16-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:16):**  not by the grants that is given to the government  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:19):**  by the Chinese.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:20):**  And the Chinese involvement isn't new.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:22):**  I think that it's been funding in part the data collection  
**[0:38:25-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:25):**  that's been used to monitor the fisheries.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:28):**  Is that correct?  
**[0:38:28-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:28):**  Yeah, correct.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:29):**  They have also signed an agreement  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:32):**  with the government of Sierra Leone,  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:34):**  and they are conducting fish stock assessment  
**[0:38:36-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:36):**  at the moment.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:37):**  We are yet to see the report of that activity.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:40):**  But that's also a very good support.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:43):**  They have brought their vessels, they've brought their scientists,  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:46):**  and they are working with our own scientists  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:48):**  to actually assess the stocks level,  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:50):**  so which is another very good support that we appreciate.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:53):**  So the reporting in the UK, at least of, well,  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:57):**  from The Guardian, which is, I guess,  
**[0:38:58-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:38:58):**  an international newspaper, has been very much focused  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:01):**  on the felling of 100 hectares of rainforest  
**[0:39:04-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:04):**  and the environmental impact there.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:06):**  You've been talking about both the economic impact  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:09):**  and the impact on the fishery overall.  
**[0:39:11-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:11):**  It sounds to me as if you think that the felling  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:14):**  of this rainforest is justified in this instance.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:18):**  Well, my surprise, I visited Black Johnson recently,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:22):**  and I noted that the place identified  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:25):**  as a site for the harbour has already  
**[0:39:28-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:28):**  been plundered by private investors  
**[0:39:30-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:30):**  with massive development going on there.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:32):**  And nobody ever talked about environmental concerns.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:36):**  They are already doing a massive construction work there,  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:39):**  building walls and cutting down trees and things like that.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:43):**  Nobody ever talked about environmental concerns.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:46):**  The government says, we want to do a harbour there.  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:49):**  Everybody shouts.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:50):**  I think that shouting of environmental concerns  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:53):**  is mostly coming to seek sympathy by landowners  
**[0:39:57-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:57):**  who have already bought land there  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:39:58):**  and are seeing the potential that they are going to use  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:01):**  their property to government for the harbour.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:03):**  So they wanted sympathy.  
**[0:40:05-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:05):**  But actually, it is not much of the environmental concern  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:08):**  because I've seen people having massive floss of land  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:12):**  up to the size of 35, 32 acres, 19 acres,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:16):**  and they've not done environmental impact assessment.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:18):**  If government is going to do the environmental impact  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:21):**  assessment and they discover that it's not feasible  
**[0:40:25-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:25):**  to do a harbour there, then they're going to look  
**[0:40:27-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:27):**  for another alternative site.  
**[0:40:29-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:29):**  These are the people who are developing the place now,  
**[0:40:31-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:31):**  calling themselves landowners, who are shouting  
**[0:40:34-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:34):**  about environmental impact.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:35):**  Have they told us what they intend to do  
**[0:40:37-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:37):**  in that plot of land?  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:38):**  No, they have not.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:39):**  And when we see the reporting in the UK and elsewhere  
**[0:40:43-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:43):**  around the world about the environmental impact,  
**[0:40:45-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:45):**  it feels to me, Phil, like there's a bit of double standards  
**[0:40:48-0:40:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:48):**  going on.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:49):**  If we think about the UK specifically, HS2,  
**[0:40:51-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:51):**  which is a big train infrastructure project,  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:54):**  is potentially damaging thousands of hectares  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:57):**  of UK landscape and wildlife habitat,  
**[0:40:59-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:40:59):**  just so that people can get from London to Manchester  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:02):**  a little bit faster.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:03):**  So it seems a bit rich for us to get too excited.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:06):**  About 100 hectares of rainforest, which as Salut says,  
**[0:41:09-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:09):**  is already semi-developed anyway,  
**[0:41:11-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:11):**  which is going to allow Sierra Leone to reap  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:13):**  more of the benefits of its own fishing industry, add value,  
**[0:41:17-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:17):**  and it's clearly such a key component  
**[0:41:18-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:18):**  of Sierra Leone's economy.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:20):**  I think what it demonstrates is that unfortunately  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:24):**  for headline writers, things are rarely as simple  
**[0:41:27-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:27):**  as the headline.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:28):**  There is a significant problem of deforestation  
**[0:41:31-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:31):**  in Sierra Leone, a significant environmental problem.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:35):**  Of course, that significant environmental problem  
**[0:41:37-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:37):**  is being caused by a significant increase in population.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:41):**  And that is something again, which the government  
**[0:41:45-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:45):**  of Sierra Leone probably should be doing something about.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:48):**  But as we've already discovered, the resources available  
**[0:41:51-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:51):**  to the government of Sierra Leone are not significant.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:54):**  So being able to control some of these issues  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:41:59):**  is not necessarily within the gifts of the government.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:01):**  It can pass laws, but if it can't afford to pay  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:04):**  for people to go out and enforce laws,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:06):**  or indeed if the people who are to go out  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:09):**  and enforce the laws can be paid more by the landowners  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:12):**  to turn a blind eye, then quite frankly, you have a problem.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:16):**  So there are problems, yes.  
**[0:42:17-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:17):**  And I think it would be really useful perhaps  
**[0:42:20-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:20):**  for the international community to look at  
**[0:42:23-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:23):**  how it can help Sierra Leone in terms of mitigating  
**[0:42:26-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:26):**  against some of the worst impact of deforestation,  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:29):**  but to highlight it just over this one specific issue  
**[0:42:32-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:32):**  is possibly being a little unfair.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:35):**  Sal, just coming back to you, do you have any concerns  
**[0:42:38-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:38):**  that the Sierra Leone fishery may get too big  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:41):**  and that its sustainability will then come under threat again,  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:44):**  but this time from Sierra Leone's own fishermen?  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:47):**  Fine. This is what I think is the concentration  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:51):**  that we should actually look at.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:53):**  All along past or recent history in fishing in Sierra Leone,  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:42:58):**  we have been concentrating on exploiting the resource,  
**[0:43:01-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:01):**  harvesting, harvesting, harvesting.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:03):**  And I think the more the population  
**[0:43:05-0:43:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:05):**  or fishing population increase,  
**[0:43:07-0:43:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:07):**  the greater the danger of our fishing.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:09):**  But if we try to diversify a bit and say,  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:12):**  okay, let's have some people actually doing  
**[0:43:15-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:15):**  the value addition component.  
**[0:43:17-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:17):**  I mean, we break down the value chain on fishing  
**[0:43:20-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:20):**  and see how we can distribute the pressure  
**[0:43:23-0:43:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:23):**  along this value chain so that we can still have  
**[0:43:27-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:27):**  a few people fishing and employing more people processing  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:30):**  and adding value to the products that is caught  
**[0:43:33-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:33):**  and still be gainfully employed  
**[0:43:35-0:43:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:35):**  than having everybody going into fishing.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:38):**  If you go to a fishing village in the country now,  
**[0:43:41-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:41):**  you'll find out some villages,  
**[0:43:42-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:42):**  a fisherman having 10, 15 children.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:45):**  None of them are going to school.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:47):**  They are all learning how to fish.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:50):**  So it means when they grow up,  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:52):**  they would also try to acquire their own small fishing books  
**[0:43:55-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:55):**  and they would all go into fishing.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:56):**  And that is dangerous.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:43:58):**  But if we can get a diversified fisheries  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:02):**  where some people are catching the fish,  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:05):**  some people are processing it,  
**[0:44:06-0:44:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:06):**  some people are selling it,  
**[0:44:08-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:08):**  then you can still have a whole lot of people  
**[0:44:11-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:11):**  being absorbed into the sector  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:12):**  without a danger to overfishing.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:14):**  And this is where I think at this point in time,  
**[0:44:17-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:17):**  it's very important to really try  
**[0:44:19-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:19):**  and see how we can diversify.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Saving-Sierra-Leones-fish-e11tope#t=0:44:21):**  Saliou, your insights have just been fascinating

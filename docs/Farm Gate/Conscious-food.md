### Farm Gate  (2022-12-14)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  of the Food and Global Security Network. One of the greatest challenges for global transformation  is mindset shift in terms of how we interact with and value people, ecology, productivity  
**[0:00:21-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:00:21):**  and profit. And because in terms of food systems, this transformation needs to happen in so  many places at once, from individual farms to large food businesses, from investors to  customers, it can be very difficult for individuals to feel that they're actually making a difference.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:00:36):**  To support transition and the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals, a new framework  has been developed called the Inner Development Goals. Alongside this, the United Nations  Development Programme, UNDP, has established the Conscious Food Systems Alliance. I'm joined  
**[0:00:50-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:00:50):**  by Thomas Legrand, author of Politics of Being and lead technical advisor to the Conscious  Food Systems Alliance and Claudio Chevaloc, a sustainability consultant and communications  manager for the Inner Development Goals. Welcome both. Thomas, let's set the scene. What do  
**[0:01:06-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:01:06):**  we mean by conscious food systems?  Thank you, Finlow. What we are working on with this Conscious Food Systems Alliance  is the role of what we call inner capacities. It's a very new concept that is developed,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:01:19):**  including in the academia. It's about mindsets, values and the inner development skills such  as the ones mentioned by the Inner Development Goals. We don't define conscious food systems.  We are rather focusing on the means to achieve regenerative food systems. So by growing these  
**[0:01:39-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:01:39):**  capacities, we think they can help food systems transition to become more regenerative. The  Conscious Food Systems Alliance is a movement of food practitioners, but also consciousness  experts who want to explore together the role of consciousness and inner capacities to transform  
**[0:01:59-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:01:59):**  food systems. So we are just launching, we have been working on that initiative with  a core group of partners and more than 100 people that we have been in touch with. And  we are just launching a digital collaborative platform to really connect together, collaborate,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:02:20):**  learn from each other, support each other on this new agenda.  Thanks so much. I'm going to try again around that conscious food systems and do push back  because I understand that you're not trying to tie it down, but I'm just trying to understand  
**[0:02:33-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:02:33):**  the difference between a conscious and an unconscious food system. And so perhaps my  own guess or my own understanding would be that an unconscious food system is one that  works relatively without ethics or morality. It buys and sells and doesn't really think  
**[0:02:48-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:02:48):**  about the impacts that it's having. Where a conscious food system is aware of those  impacts perhaps at different stages of the process from farm to fork, whether it's customers  or processors. Is that fair? Yes. Indeed. I think what we talk a lot about  
**[0:03:04-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:03:04):**  is the need to reconnect with ourselves, each other and nature and that the current food  systems are really much embodies this kind of disconnection. We are, and are growing,  cultivating consciousness cannot bridge these gaps. So for example, you know, we know that  
**[0:03:22-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:03:22):**  a lot of an LC diets will have to do with this kind of disconnect with ourselves. We  know that the way we buy food, sometimes we don't know where it's coming from, who, how  we will impact by our decisions as consumers, the farmers. So really reflect that kind of  
**[0:03:42-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:03:42):**  disconnection. And it goes on and on throughout the value chain.  Fantastic. And Claudia, the inner development goals were established to aid delivery of  the sustainable development goals. So I wonder what's the problem with delivering the SDGs  
**[0:03:57-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:03:57):**  that the inner development goals are trying to solve?  Thank you for this question. When the inner development goals initiative was established  more than two years ago, we received a request from businesses and organisations that acknowledge  
**[0:04:10-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:04:10):**  that they had sustainability policy strategies, but what they lacked is the progress. And  here, what we are trying to do, we are trying to discover a scientific approach and to collect  and communicate science-based skills and qualities that help to live a meaningful, more sustainable  
**[0:04:32-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:04:32):**  and productive life. So basically what we are doing, we are doing scientific research.  The first phase was led by Professor Thomas Jordaan from Gothenburg University. And it  helped us to establish the framework, which you already know, called inner development  
**[0:04:50-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:04:50):**  goals with five dimensions, being, thinking, relating, collaborating and acting. Under  these five dimensions were established 23 skills and capacities. And we believe that  if these skills and capacities will be trained, the leaders will grow and it will be easier  
**[0:05:10-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:05:10):**  for them to tackle global challenges and to achieve sustainable development goals.  So you mentioned the categories there, being, thinking, relating, collaborating and acting.  Could you just talk us through one or two of the 23 key skills and how those might help  
**[0:05:25-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:05:25):**  people to think differently?  If you use the IDG framework on a regular basis as a practice, for example, to evaluate  what skills might help you to sustain in difficult situations, or what capacities do you lack  
**[0:05:40-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:05:40):**  to embrace the complexity, or what skills do you need to develop and train your mindset,  you will grow not only as a person, but as a leader. And I can just take a couple of  them, for example, communication skills, what we are right now doing, collaborating skills,  
**[0:05:58-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:05:58):**  what we are doing with COFSA between IDGs organisations and COFSA aliens. We are doing  it for a bigger and more meaningful impact, to impact real lives of real people, to help  them flourish.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:06:13):**  And the hope is to understand that the SDGs are in many ways connected and to help sort  of reintroduce some of that connectivity so that people are able to think about these  on a more systemic basis to aid that practical delivery.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:06:26):**  Yes, you are absolutely right. And there are already certain researchers, not only the  IDGs, so what we are doing here, but what Stockholm Resilience Centre is doing. For  example, the Stockholm Resilience Centre model called Reconnecting to the Biosphere. And  
**[0:06:44-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:06:44):**  it helps us to understand that actually all 17 SDGs are divided in three layers. First  layer is biosphere, a second layer is social, and the third layer is economic. And they  are all interconnected. And the quintessence of this model is SDG 17, partnership for the  
**[0:07:04-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:07:04):**  goals. And if we consider this model through the lenses of a regular person, we see that,  yes, all people, they come out of a biosphere. We created societies which created economies  and vice versa, economies that serve the interests of society and people who give back to the  
**[0:07:25-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:07:25):**  biosphere.  And interesting fact that in 2016, Professor Johan Roekstrom and Professor Pawan Suhdev,  they delivered first their speech in Eat Food Forum and actually acknowledged and argued  
**[0:07:39-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:07:39):**  that the sustainable development goals are directly or indirectly connected to sustainable  and healthy food. And personally, for me, it was obvious that the second SDG was quite  important for the whole agenda 2030. It is inevitable when it comes to achieving all  
**[0:08:00-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:08:00):**  the 17 SDGs. If we look at the crisis situation, for example, when the COVID pandemic started,  the people mindsets work that way. What people have been doing at first, they went to shops,  they started to buy food, because if we look on the basic needs system, first, what we  
**[0:08:19-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:08:19):**  need is just to be sure that there is enough food. So it is obvious when we face crisis  situations, first, what we're seeing is about our needs.  And SDG2, of course, is around healthy food. And I really love that phrase that you used  
**[0:08:35-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:08:35):**  in the middle of your answer, which was around people are from the biosphere, creating societies  that are then living through and running economies. And that's a really nice way of pulling the  whole thing together. And COFSAA, the acronym that you mentioned there, of course, is the  
**[0:08:50-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:08:50):**  Conscious Food Systems Alliance. And I wonder, Thomas, how does COFSAA, the Conscious Food  Systems Alliance, link to the IDGs?  Thomas-We are focusing on food and agriculture, while IDG is a general framework. The Inner  
**[0:09:03-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:09:03):**  Development Goal is one of our strategic partners. We use their framework, but we are open to  very different perspectives. We have a rich diversity of perspectives because we work,  you know, from across the whole value chain. We work with indigenous people, but also corporate  
**[0:09:25-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:09:25):**  leaders. So because of this large diversity, we are a little bit agnostic in terms of what  framework can use. But of course, the IDG framework has been very helpful for us.  World Finance and how does the alliance operate in practical terms? I mean, what sort of people  
**[0:09:38-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:09:38):**  or organisations are members?  Thomas-People from across the food systems. Indigenous people, farmers, people from companies,  governments, the academia, and also people which are a bit innovative. People that we  
**[0:09:53-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:09:53):**  call consciousness practitioners. People that train, for example, in mindfulness, in compassion  trainings, or coming from the field of leadership or transformative education.  World Finance You used the word people there, and that's quite unusual in some of the approaches  
**[0:10:10-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:10:10):**  of the UN. Where often I hear representatives, or representatives of indigenous peoples,  representatives from country X. And you talk about people. Is it a place where individuals  from various different backgrounds come together? Or is it a place where there's representation  
**[0:10:26-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:10:26):**  by different stakeholders?  Thomas-We chose to allow people to be individual members, because we know that there's a lot  of people that we have met that feel isolated a little bit in their own organisations. I'm  
**[0:10:41-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:10:41):**  not sure if sometimes it's a hard sell when they discover this agenda, to bring the whole  organisation together. Especially if we talk about very large organisations. So we feel  these people need to find peer support, to find a community, to find the right tools,  
**[0:10:59-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:10:59):**  knowledge, etc. so that they can bring this agenda into their organisation. And of course  we have also strategic partnerships with specific organisations. But here the aliens, at the  moment, we open it to individual members.  
**[0:11:16-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:11:16):**  World Finance, that's a really interesting and quite novel approach. And I'm going to  ask the question again in a slightly different way, because I'm still sort of curious about  it, much as I hear what you're saying about the idea that there may be individuals within  
**[0:11:29-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:11:29):**  organisations that don't naturally fit within a regenerative transition of one kind or another.  They're still working for companies that are quite challenging. So there are clearly companies,  for example chemical companies, that have a vested interest in business as usual, and  
**[0:11:44-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:11:44):**  probably a greatly diminished role following a regenerative transition. So can companies  like this, or people from those companies who are still current stakeholders in the  existing paradigm, be part of an alliance that's trying to change the paradigm?  
**[0:11:59-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:11:59):**  So that has not been a priority for us to engage these kind of companies. We have rather  focused on the people who can get more easily this agenda. We found out many of them are  part of the regenerative movement. But I would say our philosophy, our general philosophy,  
**[0:12:16-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:12:16):**  is to foster more collaboration, more understanding across the food systems. So I would say in  principle, individual members who would be interested in our work would be welcome to  join.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:12:29):**  Cloudier, to what extent has the process towards the IDGs, the Inner Development Goals, been  truly global? I mean, has it been led by the global north or the global south? Is there  a unifying approach together?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:12:43):**  Thank you, Finla, for this important question. Because when the initiative was started, we  received a lot of requests from different parts of the world. People who wanted to develop  the framework together with us, who wanted to contribute, but also who wanted to bring  
**[0:12:59-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:12:59):**  it into their communities, into their cultures, into their countries. As of now, we have in  the Inner Development Goals more than 60 hubs across the globe, which come absolutely from  different parts of the world, from different continents. But what we have discovered in  
**[0:13:15-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:13:15):**  the phase two of the IDGs research, we have conducted a research to identify how to practice  the certain skills, how to develop certain skills, and which methods will help actually  to upgrade particular skills and capacities. And thanks to our hubs and thanks to our international  
**[0:13:38-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:13:38):**  partners and thanks to our researchers, we have found out that there is so much wisdom  in indigenous culture that has to be taken into consideration, that has to be integrated  into our toolkit and the methods and approaches that we're using. So this phase three will  
**[0:13:59-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:13:59):**  be all around learning from different cultures. We will go deeply into indigenous culture,  talk, listen to them, and try to learn from them. Because we realized that although the  initiative was established in Sweden and we have mostly worked with Western countries,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:14:20):**  we acknowledge that the framework itself is Western biased. So we will do our homework.  We will focus our work, our searches in the phase three around listening and integrating  the wisdom of indigenous cultures.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:14:37):**  Mason. And within the organization itself, within the organization that's responsible  for developing the framework of the inner development goals, I wonder how you go about  that. Because I presume the framework itself is going to be the same no matter who you  
**[0:14:53-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:14:53):**  are or where you are in the world. Those key skills that you're talking about are likely  to be the same. But will you be developing case studies, for example, about how you can  implement this framework in different cultures or how will you go about it?  
**[0:15:08-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:15:08):**  K  Is  nature quests or nature observation practice. And for example, such an important practice  
**[0:15:52-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:15:52):**  as just posing. Posing when you are facing a global crisis or when you acknowledge that  you are in a crisis situation.  Thanks so much. And we're going to come on to that in quite a personal sense for you  
**[0:16:06-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:16:06):**  in a little while. But before we do, Thomas, I want to sort of come back to this idea of  the importance of including voices of people from the global south of indigenous people  and valuing them alongside some of the voices that we're kind of better used to hearing.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:16:22):**  So many governmental processes in particularly the developed world, the global north, are  tipped towards science and business. Evidence-based policy often looks for peer-reviewed knowledge  from scientists and market acceptability. So do you think that the Conscious Food Systems  
**[0:16:39-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:16:39):**  Alliance will be better able to facilitate and amplify those voices of indigenous people  and the experiences of grassroots farming groups?  Indeed, we have recognised in our core principles a plurality of evidence and knowledge. That  
**[0:16:54-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:16:54):**  means we want all interventions to be able to establish evidence for the investments  we do in our capacities. But recognising the way we design them, we can rely on different  sources of knowledge, including indigenous people. And indeed, we have some partners,  
**[0:17:13-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:17:13):**  organisations interested in gathering this knowledge and being able to develop education  programmes, or even some organisations, for example, train young indigenous leaders to  do their own video documentary so that they can connect the knowledge from elders and  
**[0:17:33-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:17:33):**  disseminate it in the community. So that is very much important for us. I think it's part  of the change of mindsets, values that we want to promote. Indigenous cultures, local  communities have maintained often a different relationship to the earth, one of reciprocity.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:17:54):**  And these cultures, these set of values, we think are very important and are more and  more recognised for regenerative food systems. So we have been engaging these kinds of grassroots  stakeholders. We even have what we call a network of local hubs of organisations that  
**[0:18:15-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:18:15):**  do this kind of retreat at the confluence of inner development and food systems in different  parts of the world. And we are bringing them together in a network and to develop also  a curriculum with one of our partners, the Schumacher College. And we are about also  
**[0:18:33-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:18:33):**  to launch a dialogue with indigenous peoples, led by them, about what they think conscious  food systems is about in their own case, and how we should best work together.  Mason It's interesting. I wonder whether, you know,  
**[0:18:49-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:18:49):**  we've on this podcast before spoken with members of the high level panel of experts for the  committee on world food security, for example. And I wonder if you think that the Conscious  Food Systems Alliance, through doing the work that you're doing, will be able to bring forward  
**[0:19:05-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:19:05):**  those voices in a way that's more easily presentable for some of those committees to hear, to embed,  to understand and better inform their own work.  Alain Yeah, that's what we hope. And I think a  
**[0:19:19-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:19:19):**  lot of that also comes from the recognition that their different world views, their different  cultures is really important to do the transition that we want to see happening in the food  system. So and that means a different language. So really make space for the recognition.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:19:41):**  They don't necessarily speak the same language as us and we have very much to learn about  them.  Mason That's terrific. Claudia, one of the problems  
**[0:19:49-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:19:49):**  within individual nation states, particularly with food systems, is that policy crosses  so many separate departments of government and indeed departments within departments.  And this is reflected in the 17 SGGs themselves. Now food plays an important role in literally  
**[0:20:05-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:20:05):**  every sustainable development goal. So progress towards better food systems can be extremely  difficult because governments simply aren't that joined up. Do you think the IDGs can  help with this critical challenge?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:20:17):**  There is no doubt it will help. That's why we are right now launching the Global Leadership  for Sustainable Development Programme, an educational programme and capacity development  programme that will help us to pilot and test how actually the IDGs as a framework will  
**[0:20:36-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:20:36):**  help leaders in different countries to achieve better the sustainable development goals.  This is a joint project together with one of the COFSA members, the Inner Green Deal,  and we will teach and collect also the wisdom from participants of how practising particular  
**[0:20:58-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:20:58):**  inner skills will help them to deliver better their sustainability project at places in  their countries.  Mason Another common problem is that embedding mindset  
**[0:21:09-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:21:09):**  change is attractive and relatively straightforward in times of peace and plenty. People have  got time to think about these things much more easily. Now you're a Ukrainian citizen  and you were in Ukraine when Russia's invasion began. As someone embedded in the IDG process,  
**[0:21:26-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:21:26):**  were you able to use the inner development goals yourself to help change the way that  you and your community face the violence and the chaos?  Mira Kuznetis Indeed, it's a very personal question, but  
**[0:21:40-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:21:40):**  I'm happy to share from my experience, because my family and I were witnessed indeed to the  first weeks of war. The whole horror Ukraine has gone through as we were with my family  stuck in a summer house surrounded by troops, by missiles, and we have seen this horror  
**[0:22:00-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:22:00):**  with our own eyes. What helped me to stay resilient at that time, and I must admit I  was sometimes recalling some practices or certain situations which helped me to stabilise  my emotional level. And some of them, of course, come from the inner development goals perspective.  
**[0:22:29-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:22:29):**  And I remember myself recalling how did I feel being in the Kofsa breathing room, meditating  together collectively with the Kofsa members, and it really helped me to be more resilient,  I would say, towards what I have seen at that time. And some more of the framework which  
**[0:23:04-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:23:04):**  helped me to be more stable at that time was, of course, around the presence and inner compass,  because I realised that my biggest motivation to survive and to escape that horror were  my children. I'm a mother of two daughters and I realised that if something happens with  
**[0:23:29-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:23:29):**  me, how will they survive, how will they cope with this life, which is bringing us not only  good but also bad things. And you've left Ukraine now yourself. When we managed to escape  that village in the middle of March, I called my colleagues in Sweden from the Inner Development  
**[0:23:56-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:23:56):**  Goals Initiative and they, of course, invited me and my daughter to come immediately to  Sweden. So since then, since the middle of March, I'm based in Stockholm in Sweden. It  must be very, very difficult when you're faced by that level of chaos, by that level of violent  
**[0:24:13-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:24:13):**  disruption to allow intellect to take precedence over emotion. Do you feel that there is a  connection between those two within the Inner Development Goals or did you have to respond  and react and experience emotionally in the first instance and then allow that more intellectual  
**[0:24:34-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:24:34):**  process to take over or were you able to combine those two sort of human responses at the same  time? What was important for me to realise, maybe  after six wars since the war broke out in Ukraine, is it's super important to take a  
**[0:24:53-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:24:53):**  pause and to have an outlook of what you have witnessed, to be more conscious and to see  and realise your inner compass, your core values. My core value has always been authenticity  and I think it's super important when you can name it and then, of course, certain Inner  
**[0:25:22-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:25:22):**  Development Goals capacities will help you to grow. But first, it's important when you  are facing a crisis just to take a pause, to breathe and then to act.  I would also add here that certain practices that are now a part of the IDG's toolkit,  
**[0:25:47-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:25:47):**  such as yoga, meditation, are crucial to be an integral person, not to lose yourself but  just to continue developing and staying resilient to those global challenges we are facing.  And I think one of the lessons, perhaps, that we can take from your own experience and thanks  
**[0:26:09-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:26:09):**  so much for sharing that because, of course, it is incredibly personal and I really appreciate  you sharing what you have done, is that if you are able to take that pause even in such  an extreme situation, then it ought to be possible for all of us to take a pause before  
**[0:26:28-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:26:28):**  crisis takes place in order to be able to use that framework and use some of the skills  that are outlined within the framework.  Timno, there is no recipe because for each person a certain practice is workable, it  
**[0:26:50-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:26:50):**  works for a certain person but then it doesn't work for another person.  So the best thing is just to search for your own practices, what works particularly for  you in a certain crisis.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:27:02):**  I am 40 years old and we have witnessed different crises.  For example, I can recall global crises such as tsunami in Thailand, tsunami in Japan and  then COVID pandemic and now war in Ukraine and what unites people in all these challenges  
**[0:27:27-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:27:27):**  is that we start to speak unified universal language, language of values.  And indeed, perhaps, those crises that you mentioned and other crises that are linked  to populism, to politics, to ecological breakdown and economics, they are in many ways all connected  
**[0:27:50-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:27:50):**  and so for all of us it is about trying to find our own way forward to be able to make  sure that the systems that we exist within can change.  Actually, when I am teaching sustainability I am always referring to resilience thinking  
**[0:28:06-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:28:06):**  and there are three major pillars in resilience thinking that helps you to transform your  mindset.  First is when you acknowledge the crisis and it is how you can be persistent in staying  
**[0:28:22-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:28:22):**  on the ground and not falling down.  Second pillar is about adaptivity which cannot be so long but anyway in my example when we  stayed at the summer house and did not realize what is going on, we were caught of electricity,  
**[0:28:42-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:28:42):**  of connection, of everything, I thought we will survive because we had some basic needs  which I mentioned in the very beginning.  According to Maslow pyramid, these are of course food, water, worms, like any place  
**[0:29:06-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:29:06):**  to live.  So basic needs were covered and I thought that we will survive but it turned out differently.  And the third pillar when you realize that adaptivity will not work, it is the transformation.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:29:27):**  The moment when you realize that you should either step into a changing curve and transform  and change something and here comes the action.  It is the fifth dimension of the inner development goals framework so if you wish to change something  
**[0:29:49-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:29:49):**  you have to be brave and one of the skills and capacities is about courage of this fifth  dimension.  So what we did when we managed to escape the village, my husband went without any connection,  
**[0:30:04-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:30:04):**  without electricity, via the forest to see just with his own eyes where was the way out  because we were surrounded by tanks and self territorial defense told us that we will not  escape because tanks were shooting directly into cars where it was written children.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:30:24):**  So we realized that we do not have enough information to take decisions and my husband  went to see with his own eyes and when he returned we actually formed a column of cars  together with other families with children and we went through the forest parallel to  
**[0:30:43-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:30:43):**  Manchu road because he saw with his own eyes the road was exploded.  There was no way out, the only way out was to go via the forest parallel to the road.  And your husband stays in Ukraine now and continues in that situation?  
**[0:31:01-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:31:01):**  As you might know all men from 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave the country.  He is not in the Ukrainian army yet because he works and he looks after my younger daughter  who decided to go back to Ukraine and it was one more challenge for me, for my family that  
**[0:31:26-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:31:26):**  she did not accept the new culture, she did not want to study one more foreign language  and just to accept that we have to respect her choice that she wants to go back home  and to stay with her father although it is very unsafe.  
**[0:31:46-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:31:46):**  It is also a part of inner growth and accepting challenges.  Thank you so much for sharing those personal experiences and I want to stay with Ukraine  but to move from the personal back towards the institutional and the national.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:32:02):**  And when the war is over there is likely to be a scramble between national stakeholders  and political parties and international donors wanting to shape and indeed to benefit from  the reconstruction.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:32:15):**  Do you think at that stage that it will be possible to apply the principles of being,  thinking, relating, collaborating and acting in those circumstances?  Will there be a mindset do you believe that will be able to adopt that way of thinking  
**[0:32:31-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:32:31):**  to help to build a strong post-conflict society?  This we will discover during the third phase of the Inner Development Goals Initiative  and during research that is ongoing and during the Global Leadership for Sustainable Development  
**[0:32:49-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:32:49):**  Program because we are looking for the leaders who work in governments, who work with policies  and we do hope to collect from them and actually to discover what was the real change when  they applied the framework, when they upgraded their skills and capacities.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:33:10):**  How did it help them to achieve their project at places with the Sustainable Development  Goals?  That's why there will be also in this project one more COFSA member which is Professor Kristina  
**[0:33:24-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:33:24):**  Wamster from Lund University and she will be evaluating the results of these discoveries  and research.  Do you think that society itself will have an appetite for rebuilding infrastructure  
**[0:33:39-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:33:39):**  and society as it was immediately prior to the invasion?  Or do you think that there will be a spirit of wanting to build back something which is  perhaps better than it was before and that the Inner Development Goals might be a useful  
**[0:33:54-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:33:54):**  process for establishing what better looks like?  Again, there is no recipe.  There is no one single answer.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:34:01):**  We see more and more interest from the governments.  The first country to adopt the Inner Development Goals as a framework was Costa Rica that signed  a memorandum of understanding with the Inner Development Goals initiative back in December  
**[0:34:17-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:34:17):**  2021.  It was a public commitment for the first time I think in the history when the leaders of  the government of Costa Rica told that we see the SDGs as an accelerating tool which  
**[0:34:35-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:34:35):**  will help our institutions to develop and to grow in order to achieve and foster achievement  of the SDGs.  So it was the former minister responsible for the SDGs, Maria Pilar Garcia Corrides,  
**[0:34:58-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:34:58):**  who signed this memorandum and it was in witness of the United Nations Development Programme.  And we see now that Costa Rica will be one among pilot countries in our Global Leadership  for Sustainable Development Programme.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:35:14):**  So we are super happy to collaborate both on governmental level, on academia level,  on social level and economic level with different stakeholder groups in certain countries which  would like to integrate the IDGs framework into their daily work.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:35:38):**  And we will be super happy to collect these results into our research and to see actually  how did it help to transform the mindsets of people in all these four stakeholder groups  to better work with the SDGs, to better work with the agenda to Southern Society.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:35:57):**  It must be very exciting to have been part of the development of a framework which is  now being used by national governments as well as within other elements of society within  the food system and by individuals and that you've been able to use it yourself.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:36:12):**  And it strikes me within that sort of food systems context that the framework should  be something that can be used by an individual farmer on their individual farm to better  understand what they're doing there to create a greater circularity in their own systems  
**[0:36:29-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:36:29):**  as much as within sort of whole food chains themselves.  I think that there is like no instructions and we're not the one who will tell that particular  organizations can only use the IDG framework.  
**[0:36:45-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:36:45):**  It has been created for all, for both individuals and for organizations.  And it's interesting like how it will evolve and develop when we will measure the results.  But when it comes to the food systems, I think that it's super interesting to see in terms  
**[0:37:06-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:37:06):**  of even Ukrainians' experience because we have always been an agrarian country and right  now when the food system chains are broken because of war, how will certain farmers and  communities regenerate, restore and even witness the renaissance maybe of the agrarian sector.  
**[0:37:28-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:37:28):**  Because I think that both IDGs and SDGs may help here.  And of course, being more conscious with the consequences which we face nowadays to learn  the lessons from what we have seen and maybe to start a new approach.  
**[0:37:51-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:37:51):**  And this is also a big chance and right now I'm helping a Ukrainian NGO to create a new  e-course around circularity because we see this is a chance for Ukrainian communities,  for Ukrainian cities to start from scratch.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:38:11):**  When everything was destroyed, when cities were destroyed, we see that with a different  mindset, with different circular strategies, there is a chance to start it from scratch  and never to return to this post-Soviet history which we were living in.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:38:34):**  It's interesting because what I was seeking to do there was to, you know, we've had this  fantastic conversation around how the IDGs can be used and how they were developed.  And for listeners of the Farmgate podcast, of course many of them are farmers and are  
**[0:38:49-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:38:49):**  policy makers within the food system.  So I was interested in your answer in relation to individual farms.  But in terms of Ukraine and that agrarian society that you were talking about there,  
**[0:39:01-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:39:01):**  of course an awful lot of what Ukraine has been producing in the past around cereal and  sunflowers has been for export.  And so one of the things that I'm interested in is the way that national economies, national  
**[0:39:13-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:39:13):**  food economies can become less centred on export and more focused on, I mean, export  remaining as part of what they do, but actually becoming much more resilient, producing a  greater spread of the sorts of foods that they need so that there is a greater contribution  
**[0:39:32-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:39:32):**  to national food security from all farmers.  Is that a shift that you expect or you would like to see?  I think that Tamar mentioned it in the very beginning.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:39:43):**  The key is in reconnection to the biosphere.  The most innovative solutions are not yet used enough, but can be a solution in crisis  situation.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:39:57):**  These are nature-based solutions.  These are circular strategies.  When we will realise that actually nature is much wiser than a human being, 4.6 billion  
**[0:40:11-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:40:11):**  years old.  There is so much to learn from these strategies.  And our mission is to learn how to read the strategies from nature and apply them when  
**[0:40:23-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:40:23):**  facing global challenges and crises.  I have a very beautiful example from a Ukrainian entrepreneur who has invented a circular model  from learning the strategy from wax moss.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:40:40):**  To these insects, they can digest plastic.  They can mix a molecular of wax with plastic, digest it and then produce et along lekol,  which can further be used in different industries.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:40:56):**  This is a beautiful example of how biomimicry and actually reading from the nature from  strategies can help to tackle global challenges such as plastic recycling.  And then to make a circular model out of that and to receive a sub-product which can further  
**[0:41:18-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:41:18):**  be used even in agricultural systems.  Thank you.  Thomas, your book, Politics of Being, was written over a decade.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:41:27):**  And since you started writing it, humanity has faced enormous challenges.  We've been talking about the Ukraine crisis.  But of course, we've had also the rise of populism, the deepening ecological crisis  
**[0:41:40-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:41:40):**  around the world, coronavirus, and now the new rise of the far right in Europe.  What key insights have you discovered across that period that can help us as we face the  challenges of the next decade?  
**[0:41:53-0:42:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:41:53):**  I think we have to recognise that it's a civilizational crisis.  It's a meta-crisis.  All of our systems are going more and more dysfunctional as we step into this decade  
**[0:42:05-0:42:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:42:05):**  of disruption.  So this is an invitation to reflect what is common to all these systems.  And I think these are our culture, the human beings that are behind all these systems.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:42:21):**  And a set of beliefs, a set of values, which some people call the story of separation.  And I argue that we need to move to a different set of values, which some people call the  story of interbeing.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:42:37):**  And to me, especially my perspective, I've worked during all that time, let's say as  an environmentalist, and I've come to the conclusion that we really need, if we want  to have a chance to be sustainable in the future, we really need a deep reorientation  
**[0:42:53-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:42:53):**  of our societies.  And I argue in this book that this means moving away from having an economic growth seen as  a priority, but rather to being human flourishing, in which we recognise that we could be much  
**[0:43:10-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:43:10):**  better individually and also in our societies, and the earth could be much better together  if we strengthen this connection to ourselves, each other and nature.  And there's a lot of science I expose in the book that sustain this positive vision.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:43:30):**  You talk about the next decade being a decade of disruption.  And of course, that disruption has already started.  To me, it seems that there are so many benefits from being interconnected, but at the same  
**[0:43:41-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:43:41):**  time, the way that social media often operates, as well as having positive elements can have  some very negative elements.  There's a huge amount of polarisation that's taking place in society at the moment.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:43:55):**  So at the same time as being disrupted, people are falling into different camps.  We see it in food, we see it in the environment more broadly and in the politics more broadly.  Do you think that we can get past that as a society, as a global society?  
**[0:44:13-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:44:13):**  Is there enough appetite for reconnecting, for finding those joint solutions, for finding  that common ground that we can get through that disruption, move past that polarisation  and into something quite rapidly, which is much more creative and practical?  
**[0:44:30-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:44:30):**  I think we have no choice.  If we want to really overcome the challenges we are facing, we will need to have much deeper  collaboration.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:44:38):**  And you mentioned social media.  Well, that's a good example of some institutions that do exactly the opposite of what I'm proposing  in this book, Politics of Being.  
**[0:44:49-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:44:49):**  Basically, they are bringing out, cultivating really the worst in humans in terms of, you  know, giving more visibility to the people that are more confrontational, that are more  extreme, that there is a lot of hate speech, etc.  
**[0:45:08-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:45:08):**  So all of this is fostered by the very logic, by the algorithm of social media.  In the book, I mentioned the example of Taiwan Digital Democracy, where they design platforms  for citizens discussions that do exactly the opposite, that are trying to help people cultivate  
**[0:45:26-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:45:26):**  civic virtues of dialogue, of trying to reach consensus, etc.  And they give more visibility to the people who are trying to do that.  So that's a good example for me that would apply even to the whole society.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:45:40):**  And I mentioned the work of, for example, Elinor Ostrom, which is probably the most  influential scholar in institutional analysis.  And basically, she said the main lesson she learned from 50 years of her church is that  
**[0:45:52-0:46:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:45:52):**  instead of assuming that we are all selfish, homo economicus human beings, and we should  rather enact this vision, we should rather design institutions that bring out the best  in humans.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:46:05):**  So that's what the politics of being is about.  For the moment, it's only available in English, and will be probably next year, a French version  and other and will be translated in other languages as well.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:46:17):**  Mason.  And thinking about your experience of writing the book and that conversation we were just  having about disruption and social media and the way that polarisation happens there, the  
**[0:46:27-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:46:27):**  crises that we face, particularly in terms of the ecological crises that we face, are  likely to get worse before they get better.  As we face the coming decade, the coming generation, do you feel hopeful?  
**[0:46:41-0:46:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:46:41):**  People say they feel I'm awful because the book is full of solutions and a positive vision  for society.  And my answer is that I can't tell really what is going to happen.  
**[0:46:54-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:46:54):**  But what I know is that all societies, this is an evolutive crisis.  So either we kind of perish or we are switching to very different ways of organising ourselves  in society, which would be much better for all of us and for all the Earth community.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:47:14):**  And that makes me optimistic because I think we are forced to do that shift.  And if we were not forced by all the challenges we are facing, I doubt we would ever do that  kind of transformation.  
**[0:47:27-0:47:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:47:27):**  So I think this is what I want to bring our attention to, that it's true that we are facing  great dangers, but it's also true that we see a new world that would be much better  than the one that we have been living in, that is becoming increasingly possible.  
**[0:47:46-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:47:46):**  And that indeed is a solution to the way out of all the crises we are dealing with.  Thank you very much.  That really is a positive and hopeful vision, as you say, that we will move through chaos  
**[0:47:58-0:48:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:47:58):**  and disruption to something which is much more creative and practical and a much better  sense of working together in the future.  Fantastic.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Conscious-food-e1s8a9v#t=0:48:06):**  That's all we have time for.  I'd like to thank my guests, Claudia Chevalook and Thomas Le Grand.  If you've enjoyed listening, please come back and listen to more.

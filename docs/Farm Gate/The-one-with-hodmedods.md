### Farm Gate  (Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:18:31)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke stain, the chief executive of Farmwell and  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:09):**  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. My guest today is Josiah Meldrum, a co-founder  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:15):**  of the hugely successful online retailer Hodmodods, which works with British farms to source top  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:21):**  quality beans, pulses and grains, particularly less well known foods like the fava bean grown  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:26):**  in Britain since the iron age, but now largely forgotten. Hodmodods prides itself on its  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:32):**  relationships with farmers, all top quality agroecological and regenerative producers,  
**[0:00:37-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:37):**  most of whom farm in the east of England. Welcome Josiah.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:40):**  Hi Finn Loke, thanks for inviting me along. Now Josiah, we're going to talk about lots  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:44):**  of things, but let's start with Hodmodods. Where did it come from? How did it start?  
**[0:00:49-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:49):**  It really started in my childhood and an interest in ecology and the world around us. And I  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:53):**  think as I grew older and into my teens and early twenties, the realisation that people  
**[0:00:58-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:00:58):**  are central to the world around us and that if we want to affect change, we have to engage  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:01):**  with people. And so I went from being an ecologist and my, in my first degree was ecology to  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:07):**  studying international development at the university of East Anglia and really thinking  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:10):**  about that kind of people, planet interaction. And after that, I worked at a small regional  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:15):**  NGO on governmental organisation called East Anglia Food Link, which looked at connecting  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:20):**  people very directly with food and changing the way in which we engage with food, whether  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:26):**  that's through public procurement in schools and hospitals, or whether that's through kind  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:31):**  of community growing or farmers who are working to convert to organic agriculture. And while  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:37):**  I was at East Anglia Food Link, I met two friends and colleagues, Nick Saltmarsh and  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:42):**  William Hudson, and we began working with Transition City Norwich. Transition Norwich  
**[0:01:46-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:46):**  are part of the global transition network, which is all about how we address the climate  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:52):**  crisis and the extinction crisis and increasing scarcity of resources as our demand and consumption  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:01:58):**  patterns change. How we do that at the community level, what changes do we need to make? They  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:03):**  asked us whether we could map and model a sustainable food system for Norwich. It was  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:08):**  a really interesting idea. You know, what would it take for Norwich to feed itself was  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:12):**  their fundamental question. How would we need to change how we farm and how would we need  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:16):**  to change what we eat? That was a fantastic thought experiment which grew into this huge  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:21):**  Excel workbook of land use categories, macro and micronutrient requirements, you know,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:27):**  population movements in and out of the city, you know, how many people were you going to  
**[0:02:31-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:31):**  have to feed?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:32):**  Jason Vale And that's really fun thinking, isn't it?  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:33):**  I mean, you know, there are so many cities and towns that aren't even remotely at that  
**[0:02:37-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:37):**  stage even now.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:38):**  Paul Anthony Yeah, I mean, we were inspired by some of  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:46):**  the work that Kenneth Mellenby did, you know, Can Britain Feed Itself? And I think at the  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:47):**  time we were kind of really just interested in what this lower impact diet might look  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:52):**  like. And Norwich were fascinated, we were fascinated, it turns out it's possible. That  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:02:56):**  was the surprising thing in a way. But it's only possible if we really radically change  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:00):**  the way we engage with food and the landscape. One of the things that emerged from that was  
**[0:03:04-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:04):**  this requirement to grow more leguminous crops, those fantastic plants that have that relationship  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:12):**  with soil organisms that can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and effectively make their  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:17):**  own food. And in doing so, create these very protein dense seeds, pulses, beans and peas,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:23):**  things that we can eat, that by having those in the rotation and being able to reduce our  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:27):**  reliance on synthetic nitrogen would be really, really important. And I think the thing that  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:32):**  became clear was that we just don't eat them in the UK. And we needed to address that in  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:36):**  some way.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:37):**  Jason Vale So there's the theory, there's the kind of,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:39):**  you know, I guess the backstory up to an extent, but, but Hodmer Dodge is a step on again,  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:44):**  isn't it from that work that you were doing with East Anglia Foodlink?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:47):**  Paul Anthony East Anglia Foodlink was initially a thought  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:49):**  experiment that then became some practical demonstration project. We set up a meal with  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:54):**  a baker in the city and took grain from the edge of the city and demonstrated that in  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:03:58):**  the right hand, you can you can make delicious bread from almost anything. We established  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:03):**  a small community supported agriculture scheme, mirroring the the market garden hinterland  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:08):**  that would have surrounded the city that was really growing food for 150 families on nine  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:12):**  acres and still exists Norwich Farm Share. And the final bit was really this pulse connection.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:17):**  How do we how do we change people's attitude and diet around pulses? We thought that was  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:22):**  going to be the most difficult element. We left it till the last minute, we did a few  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:26):**  months of essentially finding what was already being grown on farms, which were fava beans  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:31):**  and peas, putting them into people's hands in Norwich and just getting their responses.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:35):**  And it was incredibly inspiring because people loved them and they were fascinated, you know,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:40):**  particularly the fava beans. Here's a crop that's been grown in the UK since the Iron  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:44):**  Age that for 2000-3000 years sustained us through the winter months. And yet most people,  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:49):**  I mean, really, most people probably still don't realise that it can be eaten these days.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:54):**  Unless they've watched Silence of the Lambs. Yeah, although. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:04:59):**  interesting because they're the fresh version. So that's the broad bean, which is green.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:03):**  So we're quite used to this higher status bean, which has to be harvested fresh and  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:07):**  that emerged in the Victorian era. But we're not used to the dry bean that's harvested  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:12):**  dry at the end of the season is a store of nutrition through the winter months. And,  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:17):**  you know, it's still really widely eaten globally. And I think one of the things that we discovered  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:21):**  early on, which actually fascinated us, is that UK farmers who produce probably a quarter  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:26):**  of a million tonnes of fava beans are sending a third of that, perhaps more, to Egypt, North  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:31):**  Africa and the Middle East, where it's still a really important part of the diet. But culturally,  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:36):**  they make a dish called fulmadame, which is a sort of bean stew, which they eat during  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:40):**  Ramadan, but also just nutritionally. They have beans for breakfast and they have fava  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:44):**  beans and we grow a lot of them. It's quite extraordinary. But your decision to start  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:49):**  a business, so you've gone through the theoretical stuff, you've been involved in what is in  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:05:55):**  many ways a sort of a campaigning endeavour to look at, you know, the food and whether  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:00):**  it can be sourced and supplied to go into Norwich. But the decision then to actually  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:04):**  go and do something about it and set up Hobnendods as a company. I mean, a lot of people are  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:09):**  quite happy to talk about these things, ruminate, proselytise, but actually physically getting  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:13):**  up and setting up a business. How did you go about doing that? And what do you think  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:18):**  central to its success? I think part of it was with a sort of sense  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:21):**  of frustration. So we'd ended this project with Norwich, with the transition group, and  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:25):**  we'd had some funding to deliver that. And we were hoping that, you know, our exit strategy  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:29):**  from that project would be to hand it to a local Whole Foods wholesaler. They would take  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:33):**  it on and hey, presto, they'd be selling beans and it would be brilliant. No one wanted  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:38):**  to touch it because these beans were not part of a current narrative of food consumption  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:43):**  in the UK. There was a lot of work to do. And so the retailers and wholesalers that  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:48):**  we might otherwise have expected to pick that up didn't want to do it. And we just became  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:52):**  really frustrated. And we spoke to farmers and said, you know, this is the sort of thing  
**[0:06:56-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:56):**  that should be happening. And they would say, yeah, of course, but where's the roots market?  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:06:59):**  If we change what we're doing on farm, how are we going to sell these crops? And I think  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:03):**  we just realised that we needed to do it ourselves. I think that there was a degree of naivety.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:07):**  We had no idea what that would involve. And that was our huge advantage in a way. That  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:11):**  was our secret weapon was not knowing what we were doing, because it allowed us to be  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:16):**  very open minded about the whole process of placing what was effectively a new product  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:21):**  onto the market. And I think we had a leg up in that we'd been working with farmers  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:26):**  in East Anglia for 10 or 15 years prior to launching Hodmedod. And we had some good relationships  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:31):**  with some people who were willing to take a chance on this idea because it was a tiny  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:37):**  and it still is. It's a tiny business. We're willing to take a chance on, you know, growing  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:41):**  some crops for us and trying to do things a little bit differently. And in a way that  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:45):**  that sort of was formative in our, in our whole way of operating the business, that  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:49):**  transparency, that connection to farm and that realisation that we would need to be  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:54):**  really, really engaged very directly with production has become very important.  
**[0:07:57-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:57):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:07:57):**  That connection with farmers, the relationship that you have with farmers seems to be entirely  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:03):**  critical to the success of the business. And so, you know, those, those years that were  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:07):**  sort of spent building up those relationships seems really important. What is it that you  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:11):**  think makes a good business relationship work between yourselves as a retailer or wholesaler  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:17):**  and the farmers who supply you?  
**[0:08:19-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:19):**  It's a tricky one. I mean, we are, we're not perfect. No one is perfect, but we're trying  
**[0:08:33-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:33):**  to do our best. And we're trying to offer a kind of supportive environment or context  
**[0:08:41-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:41):**  for farm production. So that means being very transparent about how we operate our pricing  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:42):**  and what we can pay. It means having very upfront conversations with farmers about  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:43):**  what they need, you know, what does it cost to produce a particular crop? What are the  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:44):**  risks associated with it? If we want that crop grown long term, how do we share those  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:47):**  risks to enable that to happen? What we don't want to do is just become commodity traders  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:52):**  fishing around for, you know, the lowest price on the open market. What we really want is  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:08:56):**  to help farmers develop new systems of production in which these crops which, which form part  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:03):**  of much more diverse rotations will be central. And in order to do that, that's an ongoing  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:07):**  process. It's not a kind of drop in one year and disappear the next. So we like to think  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:13):**  of us as part of a kind of relational network of supply rather than a very linear supply  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:19):**  chain. So instead of the farmer being at one end and then having some gatekeepers of value  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:24):**  and knowledge, food manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and then the end customer in their  
**[0:09:29-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:29):**  kitchen at home, we like to think of ourselves as a node in a network where there can be  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:32):**  a flow of information, knowledge and value in all sorts of different directions. Our  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:36):**  customers know who the farmer is that's produced what they're eating because their name is  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:40):**  on the pack. And we're also quite happy for them to engage directly with those farmers  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:44):**  through social media or by other means.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:46):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:47):**  I guess you're sort of answering this question, but I want to, I want to probe it a little  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:51):**  bit further. And obviously the concept of regenerative agriculture has become popular  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:09:56):**  in Britain over the last few years, but being a regenerative business, it's not about food  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:00):**  production that stops at the farm gates. And I wonder what it is that you think that makes  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:04):**  Hodmodod's a regenerative retailer. I mean, would you even think of yourselves in those  
**[0:10:09-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:09):**  terms?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:10):**  Well, we do kind of, we like to think of ourselves more as an agroecological retailer because  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:14):**  I think agroecology, I think does go beyond the farm gate. And if you look at the food  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:19):**  and agriculture organisations definition of agroecology, they have a lovely kind of 10  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:24):**  elements of agroecology. It includes things like social justice and equity and food culture  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:30):**  and things that support what's happening on farm. And we would see regenerative farming  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:35):**  as a function of agroecology. So that's what happens within the farm boundary. And then  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:39):**  beyond the farm gate, we would be applying some of these other principles around social  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:44):**  justice and equity and really a systems approach to food. And I think there's a really interesting  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:51):**  thing about the emergence of regenerative farming in that it does tend to be bounded  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:10:55):**  by the farm's perimeter or the gate. People tend to think of farms very much individually,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:01):**  individual journeys to change, but that needs to happen within a wider food system. And  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:05):**  I think there are some big numbers. We're very much aware in East Anglia of the huge  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:09):**  area of our production and the detrimental effect that that's had on the environment  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:14):**  and often in the crops that produce detrimental effect that's had on our health and wellbeing.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:18):**  And you know, the UK generally has every year around 5 million hectares of arable production.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:23):**  We've got to transform all of that. We need to think beyond the individual farm about  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:28):**  the system that's going to support that change in happening. And maybe some of that support  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:32):**  might come from government, although I'm fairly sceptical about that. A lot of it's going  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:36):**  to have to come from the market and an understanding that in order to foster and nurture this change  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:41):**  that we so desperately need to see, we're going to have to pay a little bit more and  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:44):**  not a huge amount actually, but a little bit more for our food.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:46):**  You're sort of bringing us onto the idea of scale and scaling regenerative production,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:51):**  agroecological production, but I'm aware that, you know, the concept of agroecology has been  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:11:58):**  pretty well defined for quite a long time. Organic food production has been around for  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:04):**  quite a long time, but it's neither of these have ever been able to sort of break through  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:09):**  a glass ceiling that seems to evolve. There's always something kind of holding it back.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:13):**  And so I want to ask you about the critical challenge of scale and how you think regenerative  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:19):**  agriculture, which is the, you know, the new enthusiasm of a lot of people, how that can  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:24):**  scale and get through that glass ceiling that's held back so many other sustainable food movements  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:30):**  over the last 50 years or so.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:32):**  Yeah, I think it's hugely challenging. Scale comes with all sorts of challenges and there  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:38):**  is, it's a question we're often asked, you know, how is Hodmodod going to scale up? How  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:43):**  are we going to meet the requirements of farmers and how are we going to feed more people?  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:49):**  And I think for us, we tend to think of scaling out. How do we replicate? How does every region  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:12:54):**  have a Hodmodod for example? Because with scale comes a loss in those relational kind  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:00):**  of exchanges that we might have with our farmer group and it becomes much more transactional  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:05):**  necessarily because you have to deal with things in a more transactional manner if you're  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:10):**  working at scale. And I think the scale is happening, but it's often invisible because  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:16):**  it is piecemeal. So it's very obvious to see change in a big transnational corporation  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:21):**  or in a large UK retailer because they dominate such a large part of the market. But actually  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:26):**  there's a lot going on on a smaller scale that's being multiplied and replicated all  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:30):**  across the UK that I think it feels to me is coming to some kind of critical mass. I  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:36):**  don't know, 20, 25 years ago when I started working in food and food systems, it felt  
**[0:13:41-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:41):**  like I pretty much knew everyone who was doing similar things, whether they were a farmer  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:45):**  or whether they were a campaigner or campaigning organisation. Now, every day, something new  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:51):**  and amazing is revealed to me through social media or through a connection and someone  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:55):**  saying, oh, did you know, have you seen? And it's amazing what's happening. And it does  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:13:59):**  feel to me that there is real momentum emerging now. We have to be slightly careful, I think,  
**[0:14:03-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:03):**  about corporate capture of the idea of regenerative farming. It's very flexibility and versatility,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:10):**  which is its strength, also does leave it very open to being captured by a kind of a  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:15):**  greenwash effectively. We don't need to make any broader changes to what we're doing because  
**[0:14:20-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:20):**  our farmers are practising no till or whatever it happens to be.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:23):**  We can come back to that element in just a moment. But you said two things at the start  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:28):**  of that answer, which perhaps seems slightly contradictory because you talked about the  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:34):**  idea of scaling out rather than scaling up. And then you talked about the idea of a Hodmodods  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:40):**  in every region of the UK. And I wonder quite what you mean by that last statement. Is that  
**[0:14:45-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:45):**  that you see the Hodmodods brand replicating itself or you see a Hodmodod type business  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:53):**  in every region of the UK?  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:14:54):**  I think very much the latter. I think we are a campaigning, purpose-driven business and  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:02):**  our route to market is both a demonstration of what change can look like, but it also  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:06):**  enables that change to happen. And I think Nick, William and I, I think Nick and William  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:10):**  would both agree that we spend an awful lot of our time on advocacy. And probably what  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:14):**  we're interested in is a business that is of a sufficient scale to allow us to do all  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:19):**  of these things and affect this change. And that a big part of our role is making change  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:24):**  happening in other areas and in other businesses. So, yeah, I think it's unlikely that we'd  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:28):**  see lots and lots of Hodmodods under that brand, but we might see multiple businesses  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:33):**  doing similar things. And probably and possibly and hopefully those businesses would all be  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:38):**  actively engaged with each other and would be sharing resources and ideas and possibly  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:43):**  exchanging harvests where, you know, in the South West, for example, they might be very  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:48):**  well placed to grow barley and we're better placed to grow peas, for example. So, it would  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:52):**  make sense for us to exchange those crops that we're growing. But, yeah, I think it's  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:15:57):**  unlikely that the Hodmodod itself will replicate and multiply.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:00):**  Do you think that there are that many talented and passionate people who could do what you're  
**[0:16:06-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:06):**  doing?  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:07):**  I think Nick, William and I are very lucky in coming together with a very particular  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:10):**  set of skills, a lot of enthusiasm and dedication and a real sense of the urgency around which  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:15):**  change needs to happen. And that has driven us forward. And we have sort of helped or  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:20):**  mentored other similar organisations, but they've had limited success for various reasons.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:25):**  And I think I think our commitment is we work a lot of hours. And, yeah, so I think you're  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:35):**  right. There is an issue there around how that how that works. And I think there is  
**[0:16:39-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:39):**  a degree to which, you know, explaining and communicating what's required. We've encountered  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:47):**  and overcome some of the main barriers. And I think there's lots to be shared there. One  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:52):**  of our challenges is that we don't really have a huge amount of time to do the sharing.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:55):**  Globally, there's all sorts of interesting things happening. We are sort of part very  
**[0:16:59-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:16:59):**  informally of a kind of a network of similar businesses all across the globe. Most directly,  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:06):**  there's a business called Nordisk Rovara in Sweden, and they grew out of an NGO in a very  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:13):**  similar way to us and are doing very similar things. And we've taken our pharma group to  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:17):**  visit them and they've come to visit us. And that's a really useful kind of fruitful learning  
**[0:17:21-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:21):**  experience.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:22):**  And of course, the way that I framed that sort of last pushback was around all the things  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:27):**  that you have to put in. At the same time, on the other side of that equation, I imagine  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:31):**  that it must be very rewarding to have got to where you are.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:35):**  It's really exciting. I mean, there are lots of little sort of small victories, as it were,  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:40):**  things that really keep us going. The first commercial harvest of lentils, having thought  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:45):**  initially that we'd never grow lentils in the UK. Seeing a trailer filling up with chickpeas  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:49):**  in Norfolk for the first time we think ever. Things like that are really amazing and thinking,  
**[0:17:55-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:17:55):**  wow, change can happen. And I think the transition that we've seen from being a very small idea  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:03):**  that we would talk to farmers about and they would be incredibly encouraging and supportive  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:08):**  of it in principle, but warn us that in practice it would be almost impossible. To the point  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:12):**  now where we're getting calls and emails from farmers every week who are really keen to  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:18):**  tell us about the changes that they're affecting on their farms, but also wanting to know how  
**[0:18:22-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:22):**  they might be able to get involved and engaged. I think that's really exciting.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:25):**  Within that context, Josiah, do you think that you and this network of replicated, hot  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:30):**  mudod type businesses will ever be in a position to compete with and take over from major food  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:36):**  retailers like Tesco and Asda?  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:38):**  I don't know is the honest answer. I mean, I think, I mean, obviously we would love that  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:42):**  to happen. And we see those multiple retailers and the relationships that they have with  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:46):**  primary production as fundamentally broken. They've delivered amazing things for people  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:51):**  in terms of, you know, accessibility of food and pricing, but it's come at huge external  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:18:57):**  costs which we don't properly factor in. They benefit from incumbency, they benefit from  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:01):**  historical planning, legislation, all sorts of different things that are going on. So  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:06):**  it's really difficult to see that shifting significantly. And they, you know, they control  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:11):**  95% plus of our grocery purchases in the UK as consumers, which doesn't really happen  
**[0:19:17-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:17):**  in the rest of the world. We're extraordinarily dominated by these big retail operations.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:22):**  I would like to think that we can demonstrate what a different model might look like and  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:28):**  that possibly they might adopt some elements of that and that would be a positive thing.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:33):**  I'd like to perhaps see that the planning policy and consumer preference might shift.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:37):**  And there is a sort of a new generation of very much more aware consumers who are not  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:42):**  perhaps dedicated to a big box retailer in the way that people once were and who will  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:47):**  shop around and who will make different choices and have different routes to the purchasing.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:52):**  But yeah, it's a big question.  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:19:54):**  One of the businesses that was helping to serve that sort of other 5% was Farm Drop.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:00):**  And I suppose we should talk about Farm Drop in this context because it has recently been  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:05):**  forced to close down. And for those listening outside of Britain, Farm Drop, it was pretty  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:09):**  well known, well publicised. It was an online UK retailer that specialised in food deliveries  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:15):**  from smaller and more sustainable producers. Why do you think it failed, Josiah?  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:20):**  We worked with some great people in Farm Drop. We were a supplier to Farm Drop and they were  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:23):**  really, you know, they were really dedicated to what they were doing. And they really believe  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:27):**  that their platform, their tech platform essentially could alter the relationship that we have  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:32):**  with food and the way that we come by it. But I think fundamentally they'd slightly  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:35):**  missed what it is that the food business does, which is it connects people physically with  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:40):**  food. And the cost of delivering that food is always going to be high. And there isn't  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:45):**  really, in my view, there isn't a neat software solution that's suddenly going to fix the  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:50):**  food system, particularly if you're trying to compete with those other multiple retailers  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:54):**  with that incumbency, which was the Farm Drop model fundamentally. We've always been wary  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:20:59):**  of sort of drop shipping models, this idea that a software platform will generate an  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:04):**  order and you send it out directly to a customer and they take a small commission, or of online  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:09):**  delivery models like Farm Drops, where they would take the product and deliver it to their  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:14):**  customers. Those things are hard to do. And if you're going to be a tech startup, which  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:18):**  Farm Drop perhaps aspired to be, you need to burn a huge amount of money in order to  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:23):**  carve out a niche within a really crowded and competitive marketplace. And I just don't  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:29):**  think they were ever going to be able to go toe to toe with Amazon or with the pre-existing  
**[0:21:34-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:34):**  multiple retailers. We were always, if I'm honest, nervous about  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:37):**  the model. We'd seen the amount of money that was being pumped in and the funding rounds  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:42):**  that they were going through. And we did struggle to see, based on what we knew about food retail,  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:47):**  how they would ever recover that debt. We were lucky. So we lost some money, but not  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:51):**  a huge amount. I know that there were a lot of producers for whom Farm Drop was a very  
**[0:21:56-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:21:56):**  significant customer, and particularly through lockdown and COVID, and that people were badly  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:03):**  affected by that.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:04):**  It sounds like the way that the people who were behind Farm Drop sort of saw the challenge,  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:09):**  they thought that they could resolve that challenge. They could win in that marketplace.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:13):**  But for you, your business growth has been much slower and much more organic. And because  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:20):**  it has been slower, because you've built it up from scratch and your personal relationships  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:26):**  and ability to build relationships with farmers has been central to that, that that just creates  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:32):**  a robustness, resilience and longevity that can't be replicated by a technical platform.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:38):**  Yeah, I think, yeah, so we haven't borrowed money externally. We've used bank loans and  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:44):**  we've used our own money, but we haven't gone out and looked for large amounts of money  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:49):**  in order to scale the business rapidly and increase revenue and turnover. I mean, arguably  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:53):**  we could have done, and that would be a more usual model. But because the crops we were  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:22:57):**  working with often aren't particularly scalable, we've kind of worked to the way that agriculture  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:02):**  works. So if, for example, we're developing a new crop like lentils, we really need to  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:06):**  make sure that we grow demand in advance of supply, but that we can't grow demand excessively  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:12):**  because then it just leads to disappointment. And I think we've done that. We've worked  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:17):**  very closely with the farmers who have often been very generous with the credit they've  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:21):**  offered us on purchases, particularly in the early years, and that really significantly  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:26):**  aided us as we grew the business. But yeah, we haven't done that super rapid growth, spent  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:32):**  a lot of money on marketing and advertising. We don't have, I suppose, as a lot of brands  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:37):**  and tech startups would have, we don't have a clearly defined exit strategy around making  
**[0:23:43-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:43):**  10 million quid in five years time. That's not the model. So we haven't been working  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:47):**  towards that point. Our model, our exit strategy is probably, and we hope will be employee  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:53):**  ownership at the end of the road, rather than selling out to some other bigger business.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:23:58):**  Mason, now you talked about Greenwash earlier on, you mentioned the idea that you have a  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:03):**  concern that, you know, regenerative agriculture could just be taken up by big businesses and  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:09):**  used almost as a brand, as something which is analogous with sustainability, which increasingly,  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:14):**  I think, you know, has become all things to all people. Now, even though Hodmerdodge is  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:19):**  by your definition, the tiny business, its success has given you the chance to influence  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:26):**  big name brands, to have conversations with those brands. What sort of brands and what  
**[0:24:31-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:31):**  do you say to them?  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:32):**  Hodmerdodge Well, all sorts. And some of them are quite  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:34):**  big, you know, they, they, they phone us up, we get the new product development teams from  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:39):**  businesses like PepsiCo or like Unilever, you know, who would come to us and say, you  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:43):**  know, we're doing X, Y, and Z with plant proteins. What can you supply us with? What's your advice?  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:47):**  We want to understand it. We're not particularly interested in supplying them. We don't really  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:51):**  have the scale or capacity to do that. But we're happy to have that conversation. And  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:24:54):**  so, for them, we might be encouraging them to think about whole foods, whole pulses,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:00):**  they're very interested in the fractions that you might be able to derive from a from a  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:03):**  soybean or a pea and reconstituting that and using it in snack products or alternative  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:08):**  meat products or what have you. And we would say, well, you know, we do minimally process  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:13):**  whole foods, the best way to eat a pea is when it's a pea, not to try and break it up  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:18):**  and put it back together again into something else. And that's a difficult message for them.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:22):**  And I think there's another fundamental message where if you're Pepsi and a big part of your  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:27):**  business is making brown sweet water, I mean, there is a fundamental question, which is,  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:32):**  however much work you do on water resource management and sustainable sugar, and so on  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:36):**  and so on. Ultimately, you're making something that people don't really need. And that's  
**[0:25:40-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:40):**  a quite difficult thing to confront. They do quite like it though, don't they? People  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:44):**  do quite like this. And surely the future needs to include some of the things that people  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:51):**  want as well as some of the things that people need. They do. But I think those larger businesses  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:25:56):**  have to address what it is that they're making. And really, and I'm sure they probably are  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:00):**  internally. I mean, there are good people that work for these businesses, that sometimes  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:03):**  the behemoth of the entity in itself can be quite difficult to turn around. And, you know,  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:08):**  it'd be really interesting to know what their views on that are. But yeah, you're right.  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:15):**  We enjoy things. We don't necessarily, the things we enjoy aren't necessarily always  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:19):**  best for us.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:21):**  And at the end of the day, I suppose, you know, there are potentially things out there  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:24):**  that we haven't tried yet, which may well include, you know, the things that are on  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:29):**  your menu of items that you sell that a lot of people haven't tried yet. And the joy of  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:36):**  whole ingredients may be something that just a lot of people haven't realised they really  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:41):**  want to enjoy.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:42):**  Josiah, we've talked quite broadly about sustainable retailing and how to scale regenerative solutions.  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:48):**  Perhaps for a moment we can zoom in on British policy. When we left the European Union, there  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:54):**  was a remarkable opportunity to transform agricultural land use from the extractive  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:26:59):**  industry it's become to a regenerative profession, a community of thriving farmers and food business  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:06):**  businesses of all sizes. I wonder, how do you feel about the future of British farming  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:11):**  at this point in 2022?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:13):**  I think that whatever one's feelings about Brexit, it did offer an extraordinary opportunity  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:20):**  to re-look at agriculture, as you rightly say, in the UK and how we farm and what we  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:26):**  farm and what we want out of the landscape as well, collectively as a population. And  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:30):**  obviously we want food, but we also want thriving biodiversity. We want some amenity use, all  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:35):**  of those things. And I felt kind of positive that we were going to get some of that through  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:40):**  some of the work that was going on around and just after Brexit. I have to say, I feel  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:45):**  like some of the political pressures are changing that narrative and we're seeing kind of a  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:51):**  dilution of some of those early optimistic kind of visions for a collaborative future,  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:27:56):**  as you say, a thriving community of farmers and food businesses that work together. I'm  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:01):**  still positive. I do feel, you know, the clock is ticking and we've got commitments to net  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:07):**  zero. I still don't think they're radical enough. And I don't think that farming has  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:13):**  been broadly engaged enough around any of these issues. And for example, and I'm sure  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:18):**  everyone is well aware of this, but where was farming at COP? And where's the voice  
**[0:28:22-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:22):**  of farming in some of the big solutions that we might be able to offer up in terms of climate  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:28):**  change and biodiversity loss? You know, they're on our doorstep, they're under our feet. And  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:32):**  it would only take some joined up and careful policy in order to really incentivise and  
**[0:28:37-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:37):**  accelerate change. I'd like to see government departments, for example, not just thinking  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:42):**  about their own territory, but thinking about the overlap between other departments, moving  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:47):**  away from siloed thinking. So that DEFRA might talk to the Department of Health, for example,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:51):**  about food and nutrition as well as farming, and that we might be engaging education and  
**[0:28:56-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:28:56):**  DEFRA to look at how people value rural work and how we encourage people to think of this  
**[0:29:04-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:04):**  as a fantastic, exciting employment opportunity.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:07):**  And I suppose, you know, when you mention those different departments, I think increasingly  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:12):**  there is a lot of work, particularly at NGO level, which is connecting the health outcomes  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:16):**  of food and food production. But as you say, there is still this kind of drain from rural  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:21):**  areas into the city. And very often, you know, those kids that have grown up and become students  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:26):**  and gone to the city to make their fortunes, then often don't come back and start working  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:32):**  the land. And for 20 years, farmers have been told that they're part of the problem rather  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:37):**  than part of the solution. And, you know, one of the contentions of this podcast of  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:41):**  many of the people I talk to is that land use is the central thing that offers us a  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:48):**  solution, that offers us hope as we face the ecological crisis. And that story, as you  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:53):**  say, it's just not getting through at the moment.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:29:55):**  No, I mean, it's never been that in a way, I think, since certainly since the Second  
**[0:30:00-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:00):**  World War and, you know, the post-war productivist paradigm, which saw yield as being the principal  
**[0:30:07-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:07):**  objective of farming and a continued depopulation of rural areas and a devaluation of field  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:14):**  workers and farmers, you know, who became largely, I'm afraid to say, kind of seen as  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:18):**  factory floor operatives who would do what the seed companies told them in terms of drilling,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:22):**  what the machinery companies told them in terms of machinery, you know, would sell into  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:28):**  the markets that the grain traders advised and would be paid the price that the global  
**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:32):**  commodity traders had indicated and frankly lost their agency and lost their ability to  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:37):**  make decisions about the farm that they worked, the land that they knew and how to do things,  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:42):**  you know, in perhaps the best way. And I think we do need to get back to that. We do need  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:48):**  to give farmers a bit more agency and empowerment.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:51):**  That's where businesses like yours come in, isn't it? Because that's about recreating  
**[0:30:55-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:55):**  that agency.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:30:56):**  Yeah. So for example, with a project like the lentil production, we worked out, you  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:00):**  know, what the basic agronomy was and how best to grow lentils, when to drill them,  
**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:04):**  when to harvest them. But when we work with a farmer group, we don't, we don't send them  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:07):**  out with a kind of agronomic package that tells them what to spray when and when to  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:11):**  do it. We ask them not to spray anything. Instead we say, you know your land, you know  
**[0:31:16-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:16):**  your farm, how are we going to work out how to grow these lentils on your land? And that's  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:19):**  for the, for most of the farmers that we engage with, they love that, you know, it may only  
**[0:31:23-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:23):**  be a five hectare area of lentils that they're growing, but what an exciting project to use  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:29):**  all of their farming knowledge and skills from, from their engineering skills to make  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:33):**  sure they've got the machinery working properly all the way through to their knowledge of  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:37):**  plant science and soil science to harvest a crop that really hasn't been grown in the  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:42):**  UK commercially, certainly for a few hundred years. And that's brilliant. They jump at  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:45):**  that chance and that opens the door, I think for them to other possibilities. How can I,  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:50):**  how can I move some of my other cropping area out of this commodity system? How can I look  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:53):**  at other routes to market for these commodities that are actually food and they're delicious  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:31:58):**  and we really need to revalue them.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:00):**  Jason Vale Just staying on the more macro policy level  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:03):**  for a little bit longer. One of my concerns, you know, and, and, and as you know, as we  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:08):**  discussed in those sort of first few years since the referendum, there was a lot of excitement.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:13):**  There seemed to be a lot of conversations where government actually seemed to be getting  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:16):**  it, seemed to understand the importance of multi outcome land use. But one of my concerns  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:21):**  now is the government in Westminster, despite all that positiveness of those conversations  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:26):**  following the referendum, seems fundamentally to have bought into the idea of land sparing  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:32):**  and the national food strategy, for example, that came out recently reflects this in what  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:36):**  it chooses to call zoning. But when land sparing has been shown repeatedly to be so hugely  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:42):**  inefficient and damaging, I wonder if you have any thoughts about why it is that this  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:47):**  dangerous resurgence of support is happening for this particular model of land use.  
**[0:32:52-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:32:52):**  James Rylie I think for the most part, we need to be looking  
**[0:33:19-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:19):**  at land sharing approaches, for example, through through agroforestry, where you've got, you  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:25):**  know, nutrient cycling, you've got carbon capture, you've got soil health, and you've  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:29):**  got food production, and you've got space to coexist with with wildlife with the nature  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:34):**  around us. And I just, I think that kind of complex thinking when it comes into policy,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:38):**  civil servants just find it incredibly difficult to deliver and politicians find it incredibly  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:42):**  difficult to communicate. I don't know whether that's our fault as people that are working  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:46):**  in this sector. I don't know what we need to do. I don't know what the answer is.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:51):**  Paul Edmondson One of the problems must be around the, I hesitate  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:54):**  to say the number of people that work in Defra, but there's certainly the number of different  
**[0:33:57-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:33:57):**  departments that mean, as you were saying that, you know, there's a department that  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:00):**  deals with carbon, there's a department that deals with animal welfare, a department that  
**[0:34:04-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:04):**  deals with water. And that just inevitably creates this sort of siloed approach. Whereas,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:11):**  you know, you go across to Wales and talk to the Welsh government, it's a much smaller  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:14):**  department where people can effectively talk across the room to each other. And in that  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:20):**  way, you end up with a much more joined up approach and a much better understanding of  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:24):**  that multiplicity of functions that a single piece of land can deliver.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:28):**  David Pembroke Yeah, I mean, I think it is a problem. And  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:30):**  I think, you know, the terrifying thing about about the land sparing model is obviously,  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:35):**  you know, which land is going to be spared? Who's going to spare it? How are they going  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:38):**  to be paid to spare it? Does it, is that the right land to spare? How are we going to measure  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:42):**  that and what decisions do we make? And then what happens on the land we don't spare? Is  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:46):**  that just a license to pound it as we have done post-war for yield? Because I think that's,  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:53):**  that seems to be the model that's being kind of promoted in some quarters. And, and you  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:34:57):**  know, what sustainable intensification might actually mean for that land could be pretty  
**[0:35:01-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:01):**  disastrous, I think. Jason Vale As we speak, there's a cost of living  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:04):**  crisis and more and more people are struggling to cope with the everyday day to day expenses.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:10):**  And against this backdrop, with fears about inflation and electoral fortunes, perhaps  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:15):**  inevitably tied to the flexibility people feel inside their wallets, can you ever see  
**[0:35:20-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:20):**  a government taking action? David Pembroke  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:21):**  I hope so. I'd like to think so. Possibly not this government. I think, I think there's  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:27):**  a big issue, isn't there? No, no government, no, no monarch or whoever it might have been,  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:33):**  wants to see bread rise. You know, that is where the revolution starts when people either  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:38):**  cannot access food or food has become too expensive. And I think making sure food is  
**[0:35:43-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:43):**  cheap at the point of consumption is a big part of, as you say, government of electability,  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:50):**  and no one wants to go to go to elections saying we're going to make food more expensive.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:54):**  That feels like it's not going to happen. And not addressing that, and ensuring that  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:35:59):**  there is always this cheap food, whatever the quality of that food might be, means that  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:03):**  the bigger issues can get brushed under the carpet. And the biggest structural issues  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:07):**  are around inequality. You know, over the last 30 years, you know, the UK has become  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:12):**  increasingly unequal, and we are now one of the most unequal societies in the G7. We really  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:19):**  need to, we need to look at that problem. And I don't feel that's coming through levelling  
**[0:36:24-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:24):**  up. I don't feel that's coming through, you know, policies around access and inclusion  
**[0:36:30-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:30):**  in education and schools. I think one of the questions that's really interesting that we  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:33):**  often get asked, and it feels like a real pushback from, from probably from people who  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:38):**  can afford to buy our beans and peas and other products, is that they'll say you're too expensive,  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:43):**  you know, how are we going to feed the poor if they all have to buy your pulses? And of  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:47):**  course, our pulses are in fact, in an absolute sense, really very cheap, you know, a packet  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:51):**  of peas will feed four people a couple of meals. The real question ought to be why,  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:36:57):**  if we're paying the right price to our farmers, if we're paying our employees, our staff,  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:03):**  a living wage that they can, that allows them to do the things that they want to do and  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:06):**  have the lives that they, they want to lead. If we're doing all of those things and yet  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:10):**  our food is too expensive, you know, what's gone wrong here? Why is it that people who  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:14):**  are employed by some of the biggest food manufacturers and retailers have to depend on food banks?  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:19):**  That's a ridiculous situation. And yet shareholder profits seem to be going up. I don't understand  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:24):**  how we've come to this place where people can't eat properly.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:27):**  You're talking there, you know, about this big scale of reform that's needed within the  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:33):**  economic system. And I'm sure many people listening to the podcast will agree that that's  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:37):**  absolutely required. This rebalancing of the economy is essential. But there's a question  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:42):**  of timing, isn't there? And I guess that's part of the ethical question here that we're,  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:47):**  you know, we're trying to deal with. And so just playing devil's advocate, when so many  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:52):**  people are feeling such a squeeze on their living standards as they are today, post COVID,  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:37:57):**  at the time when energy prices are beginning to skyrocket, is now the time to focus on  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:04):**  internalising these negative costs of extractive agriculture, even though it risks price rises,  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:10):**  and an even greater impact on people living in or close to poverty.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:15):**  I continue to think that if we address those structural problems within society, and that  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:21):**  can be addressed politically, then the poorest will not be hit hardest by those changes.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:26):**  And the fundamental factor is that the connected crisis that we face around climate and species  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:32):**  loss and so on, will affect the poorest both here and globally, the hardest. And if we  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:37):**  don't address them now, then we're going to be picking up much more of a mess in 10 or  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:42):**  15 years time. If we don't address the damage we're doing to our water system or to our  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:48):**  air in terms of pollution, if we don't address climate change that is going to put very marginal  
**[0:38:53-0:39:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:38:53):**  people at higher risk of morbidity, then we've got to, we've got a serious problem. So I  
**[0:39:00-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:00):**  think if we can't internalise those externalities now, and if we can't work out a way of doing  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:07):**  that, that doesn't hit those people who are really struggling hard, then as a society,  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:12):**  we've got to take a look at ourselves. There are no news stories about the changes that  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:17):**  we need to make in our pants of consumption and the way that we live and the impact that  
**[0:39:21-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:21):**  that has on the world around us.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:22):**  We're coming to the end of the programme. So just finally, let's go back to Hodmodod.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:27):**  What next? Where do you see your business in five years time? What are your immediate  
**[0:39:32-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:32):**  priorities?  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:33):**  Yes, I mean, we've just talked about some pretty dark stuff, I think. Some of the biggest  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:38):**  structural problems that we face. And yeah, Hodmodod exists because we're, Nick, William  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:42):**  and I, we're just incredibly optimistic about what it is that we're trying to do. And we're  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:47):**  really excited about the potential for change. And we do think that if we didn't think that  
**[0:39:52-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:52):**  this could work, we wouldn't do it. And so, I mean, the next five years is all about growing  
**[0:39:59-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:39:59):**  and developing our farmer network and the area of land that we're able to help them  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:03):**  steward and find a route to market for the crops that are grown from. To develop some  
**[0:40:07-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:07):**  new crops, to add further diversity to farmers and plates and stomachs. And to just tell  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:13):**  that story to a much wider audience. I mean, it's incredible when we think that when we  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:18):**  started 10 years ago, pulses were seen as very much a kind of hair shirt, 70s foodstuff.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:25):**  And yet now they're getting incredibly trendy and fashionable, and there's a lot of interest  
**[0:40:30-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:30):**  in them. And so I think in the next five years, that transformation will continue and accelerate.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:36):**  And I feel very, very optimistic about what we can achieve within the space that we're  
**[0:40:41-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:41):**  working. Fantastic. So big challenges around the world, big need for structural reform  
**[0:40:46-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:46):**  at home and abroad. But Hobmer Dodge, your business is very much part of the change that  
**[0:40:54-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:40:54):**  we need to see. And in so many ways is a model for that kind of business to replicate around  
**[0:41:01-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:41:01):**  Britain and in other countries with those wonderful relationships that you have with  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:41:06):**  your suppliers and the compassion that you have within the business for your staff and  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:41:10):**  the dedication, you know, for the industry that you're part of. It's been fascinating.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Hodmedods-e1eprhf#t=0:41:15):**  Thanks so much. But that is all we have time for. I'd like to thank my guest, Josiah Meldrum

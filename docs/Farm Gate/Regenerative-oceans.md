**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finn Loke-Kustain. Over the last few years, regenerative agriculture  has moved from a fringe discussion or activity to a movement that's capturing people's  imagination around the world. At its most basic level, regenerative agriculture is rooted  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:00:22):**  in mindset change – farmers needing to stop seeing themselves as livestock managers so  much as land managers. And that means focusing on the soil and the delivery of high-functioning  ecosystem services. For example, ensuring efficient photosynthesis, mineral cycling  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:00:38):**  and water flows. And in this way, farmers can reduce their inputs – lowering both  costs and the negative impacts – at the same time as boosting their yields.  Regenerative agriculture has many champions on land. And the principles have been integrated  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:00:53):**  on farms both large and small – on land. But today, we're asking the question, can  regenerative farming principles be transposed to the ocean? And if so, at what scale? To  consider those questions, and possibly more, I'm joined by two venerable and learned  
**[0:01:09-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:01:09):**  guests. Dylan Walker is the chief executive of the World Cetacean Alliance and Alex Tomlinson  is a vet and regenerative agriculture specialist. Hello both.  Hi. Let's start off, Dylan, if you would, just  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:01:23):**  an introduction about the work that you do. And perhaps you could talk us through why  it is that we think that regenerative oceans may be necessary. In other words, what's  the problem that we're trying to address? Thanks, Finlow. So the organisation that I  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:01:38):**  work for is the world's largest marine conservation partnership. We work through our partners  in 35 countries on a range of marine conservation issues, primarily to try to protect whales  and dolphins. But fundamentally, our role is really working with, through our partners,  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:01:56):**  with local communities. How do we engage local coastal communities, the people who live close  to incredible whales and dolphins, but all the other wonderful diversity of marine life  that we still have out there in a way that's sustainable and puts food on people's plates  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:02:11):**  and provides other what are now called ecosystem services, opportunities for people to make  a living from our natural world? I think what's interesting about this podcast actually is  to draw lots of comparisons between the oceans and the land, because they're really not so  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:02:26):**  very different. You know, if we go back far enough, we can see that in both ocean and  land ecosystems, we had far more life, far more richness and far more opportunity really  in the past. And so I think a big job for us, both through regenerative agriculture  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:02:42):**  and other interesting concepts on land, but also replicating those in the ocean, are to  apply some of these concepts, bring back nature and that kind of ecosystem richness, which  is good for wildlife. But importantly, it's really good for us as well. There could be  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:02:58):**  a lot more food for us to eat out there if we work with these systems to allow them to  recover. One of the big differences between the land and the sea is that you can see what's  happening on the land. And regenerative agriculture isn't just about the farmers. It's about the  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:03:14):**  champions and the fans. You know, there are a lot of people in this movement around the  world who believe in it because they can see the difference that's being made. Whereas  we care in abstract really about the ocean. We know about killer whales and sharks and  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:03:30):**  dolphins and things like that, that jump out of the ocean and the organisations like yours  are fantastic at championing. But what's actually going on underneath the surface of the ocean  and on the seabed is really quite remote.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:03:43):**  I think that's right, Finlow. I agree with that. But what I would say, and I think this  is a positive thing, is that I think those kind of boundaries between what we can see  at the surface when we stand on the beach and look across a piece of ocean, it looks  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:03:56):**  beautiful no matter what's happening underneath it, and what's really going on, that kind  of boundary is being broken down all the time. I think human beings and our communities are  interacting much more with the ocean all of the time. And some of that is through things  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:04:10):**  like fisheries and food production, but it's also through, for example, media. Look at  Blue Planet and Blue Planet 2, how that's brought the oceans into millions and millions  of homes across the world. The industry that I'm heavily involved in, whale watching tourism,  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:04:26):**  that's 13 million people in 120 plus countries around the world going to see whales and dolphins  out on the ocean every single year. All these numbers are sort of increasing all the time.  The good news is I think those barriers are being broken down.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:04:41):**  OK, I take that point, and that's really interesting. And you're absolutely right, through TV as  a window into that world is fantastic. And of course, there are a lot of people that  really want to engage directly.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:04:53):**  One thing I would also say is that in terms of, yes, the land is more visible, if you  like, but equally people's perception of what they're seeing is beginning to alter in the  light of information about regenerative agriculture and so on. So instead of people looking at  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:05:10):**  a green field of monoculture ryegrass and saying, isn't it beautiful, it's nice and  green, there's beginning to be a shift in understanding of the perception of what you're  looking at and understanding exactly what you're seeing and that just because it's green,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:05:22):**  it doesn't necessarily mean it's good. So there's another element to this as well about  understanding what you're seeing and seeing through different eyes, if you like.  There is that challenge, isn't there, that a lot of people are disconnected from the  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:05:35):**  land and we kind of, you know, we look out across it and we think because it's green,  because there aren't buildings there, because there is an industry that's visible, that  everything that nature is thriving. And I wonder if you could just talk a little bit  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:05:48):**  about regenerative agriculture in terms of what's the problem that regenerative agriculture  is trying to address and how is it managing to do that, to transform that land that looks  like it's perfectly green and productive into something more?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:06:03):**  Well, essentially regenerative agriculture is a complete mindset shift in the way that  we work with the land. So, I mean, going literally going back centuries, the way we have farmed  in terms of soil disturbance, ploughing, tilling, set-stop grazing, we have progressively, slowly  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:06:20):**  but surely, degenerated the land and taken it back in terms of ecological succession  from great complexity to simplified landscapes above ground and below ground. So simplified  soils, simplified plant diversity, and that's accelerated dramatically in the last 50 years  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:06:42):**  post-war. So really what regenerative agriculture is doing is trying to reverse that change  to bring back the complexity to the terrestrial ecosystems.  Yeah, I think Alex makes a really good point there and it's impossible for me to not sort  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:06:58):**  of translate what she's saying and think about our oceans in the same way, because the parallels  here are sort of almost spine-tingling in a way. I don't think it would be good to spend  much time talking about the kind of destructive element of the way that we farmed or fished  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:07:15):**  in the past on this podcast, because I think there's a wonderful opportunity to talk about  the positive opportunities of the future. But in essence, bottom trawling for shellfish  and other seafood is the single most destructive form of fishing practice and it basically  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:07:30):**  echoes ploughing almost identically. And of course, that's certainly across our continental  shelves, our shallow seas and close to our coasts. These are really the lifeblood of  our oceans. That's where our green plants, our seaweeds, our kelps, which protect young  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:07:46):**  fish species as they're growing up and provide for our fisheries in the first place, do get  destroyed. So it's very interesting to draw those parallels.  And so I guess within that context, the question is, is it even possible to fish sustainably?  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:08:00):**  When I say fish, what I'm talking about is that kind of the hunter-gatherer notion that  fishermen have of themselves and their industry going out and taking wild caught fish from  the oceans and to draw a distinction between that kind of fishing and aquaculture and fish  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:08:14):**  farming, whether one is inherently unsustainable and one is potentially sustainable, even though  it's, you know, as an industry, it's got a long way to go.  I think that's a really interesting question. And I think we should be exploring it in more  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:08:28):**  detail. And if we draw the comparisons with what's happening on land, and they're not  entirely fair, but in simple terms, I think it's really interesting that we've had, you  know, a good number of years where we've talked about the importance of organic farming and  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:08:43):**  that's, you know, grown in importance. And now the discussion is, well, you know, we  need to go further, we need to be able to do more, we need to look at, you know, regenerative  agriculture, we need to, you know, restore our ecosystems. I think it's really, really  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:08:56):**  interesting when you look in our oceans and we talk about, you know, sustainable fishing,  and we have a whole variety of sustainable fishing labels for various fish species in  supermarkets and fundamentally labels are focused on keeping fish populations at stable  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:09:13):**  or improving, but effectively at the same level as they are now. But actually, you know,  when we look at our history in our oceans, you know, we're effectively fishing in a desert  out there, you know, we have lost so, so much, we're really fishing in a very, very impoverished  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:09:29):**  environment. You know, I would liken it to saying to a farmer, you're allowed to farm  on that sort of steep mountainous hillside, but you can't farm in a productive valley.  The answer for me would be instantly, I want to farm in a productive valley, but you can't,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:09:43):**  it's gone. You know, we fish a productive valley out, we've changed our ocean ecosystems  and to reduce that productivity. So, you know, I think what's interesting here is if we start  to look at regenerative processes in our oceans, like we are on land, first asking a question,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:10:00):**  what does that mean? Is it achievable? But it is achievable in ecosystems, which are  far more vibrant and far more productive than they are now. And I think that's a really  exciting potential.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:10:10):**  World Finance, one of the fundamentals of regenerative agriculture, Alex, is the way  that it's from the ground up. It's about restoring the building blocks of life. And I wonder  if you could just talk us through that a little bit, and maybe Alex, if you could reflect  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:10:24):**  a little bit on how the regenerative movement has become such a big movement. I mean, I  wouldn't say it was necessarily mainstream, but it's not far off being a mainstream movement  these days. And clearly it started from somewhere, and at the point that it started, there's  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:10:39):**  a strong likelihood that the farmers who were doing it were just seen as kind of hippies.  Yeah, very much so. If you look widely, that still is the case. There's still a lot of  scepticism out there about these approaches. But if you talk to farmers that are actively  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:10:54):**  doing these regenerative approaches, it's a beautiful thing to listen to, because they  have seen the changes happen on their land, and they've seen the soil evolve and build,  and they've seen the complexity develop in their swards, and from the swards into invertebrates  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:11:11):**  and bird life and small mammals, and higher up into the whole flora and fauna developing  in complexity. So in terms of the seas, I think the one significant thing that leaps  out as different for me is that on the land, we really have lost completely a lot of our  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:11:31):**  top predators. And we're not suggesting we reintroduce those. There are lots and lots  of issues to consider with that. But the impact of losing those can be dramatic and can prevent  us really reaching full complexity in our ecosystems. And that is something that maybe  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:11:47):**  in the marine systems, we have more opportunity to get that complexity back and more quickly,  because potentially, we haven't lost the sort of top of the food chain predators completely  like we have in terrestrial systems.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:12:00):**  Do you think there were parallels in the ocean that you can think of around that area of  the role of top predators?  Oh, massively so. You know, it really is. It is exactly the same as what's happening  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:12:12):**  on land and where we're relatively recently realising that there are large predators which  effectively manage and control the ecosystem and they enrich it. And we call them ecosystem  engineers. And the same is exactly true in ocean ecosystems is on land. In oceans, they  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:12:30):**  are, you know, those large predators are whales, dolphins, seals, you know, the big herbivores  are turtles of which we have lost millions and millions and millions. You know, they  literally managed seagrass beds, you know, across our tropical shallow waters and made  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:12:46):**  them incredible habitats again for small fish as they were growing and being protected in  those areas. So it really is exactly the same. We now know and this is contrary to what Japanese  whalers have told us for decades really, you know, they put forward the argument that whales  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:13:03):**  were stealing fish from from fishers. So if we hunted whales and we reduced whale stocks,  there would be more fish for people to eat. We now know that more whales means more fish.  It sounds counterintuitive because whales do eat a lot of fish depending on the species.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:13:17):**  And but what they do is they also recycle nutrients in the water column. So they dive  down deep, they feed on huge quantities of fish, but they then must come back up to the  surface to breathe and to rest and they defecate at that point and they put huge amounts of  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:13:32):**  nitrogen and important elements like iron back into the water column in the very layer  the surface layer, which is where the sunlight is penetrating the ocean to its greatest extent  and that's where the green grass of our sea grows. That's where phytoplankton grows and  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:13:47):**  that's the basis for you know, many of these large ocean food chains. So you can see the  logic behind having more of these big predators and big herbivores in our marine ecosystems  and actually having more food for all of us.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:14:00):**  I'm struck because I think in a previous conversation we've talked about a particular whale that  behaves actually like a bottom trawler.  Yeah, I mean, I think there's, you know, there's nothing wrong with extraction. There's nothing  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:14:12):**  wrong with hunting. It's what we as part of our terrestrial ecosystems have done for millennia  and it's what lots of other animals have done. And as part of an enriched ecosystem that  works very, very well. We're working in a very impoverished ecosystem and we tend to  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:14:26):**  kind of forgotten its potential really. The species of whale that you're referring to  Finlow is called a gray whale. There's 25,000 plus strong population on the Pacific coast  of North America, but our population in Europe was hunted to extinction. So we no longer  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:14:42):**  have it and it filter feeds. It goes to the bottom of the ocean and it literally acts  like a mini trawler. It opens its jaws and it scrapes the sea floor and it feeds on those  animals. Now, there is lots of evidence to show that the North Sea, for example, had  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:15:00):**  huge oyster beds in the past. You know, potentially they were so big that the North Sea was actually  clear at that time because they were filtering so much sediment out of the water column.  Imagine that if the North Sea was crystal clear today. Now, if there were huge oyster  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:15:14):**  beds and mussel beds in North Sea and gray whales are coming along and effectively trawling  some of that ecosystem for their own purposes, they were not doing that on a small scale.  Gray whales eat a lot of food. So it's quite easy for us to kind of transplant that concept  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:15:29):**  and say, well, if we had a regenerated North Sea, we either can have the potential to take  the place of gray whales that are no longer there or possibly even better. You know, one  day we introduce gray whales back into this ecosystem because they may well make it stronger  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:15:45):**  than it is today and still be able to take large numbers of these shellfish.  So what's the basic difference? What's the basic difference between, you know, a fishery,  which is essentially a scallop fishery and there's that sort of regular trawling of the  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:15:58):**  sea bed and the relationship between the gray whale and the North Sea?  Well, I think, you know, in an ecosystem, extraction is a balance. Everything is a balance.  If you over extract, you tip that balance one way and the ecosystem starts to fail.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:16:13):**  You know, you see it through nature as well. If a species, especially what we were talking  about before, these kind of ecosystem engineering species, as they're also sometimes called,  you know, if they suddenly decline, could be naturally or through man's impact. So disease  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:16:27):**  would be one reason. If they suddenly decline, then the whole ecosystem can go out of kilter  and then it's not as productive. It's not as efficient. It's not as diverse. So really,  by putting all of these things back in the ecosystem, letting it run as close to how  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:16:43):**  we imagined it was in the past, that really should provide us with a lot more food and  we should be able to take our share.  Interesting. And Alex, I'm just sort of want to come back to you on that notion of the  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:16:54):**  reduction of complexity, because it seems to me, you know, on land in particular and  potentially in the ocean as well, that reductionism has been the policy of the last 70 years or  so of agriculture. It has been about reducing complexity, simplifying systems so that farmers  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:17:13):**  are producing one crop. They become really good at managing their land to produce that  one crop and using all kinds of inputs to make sure that that crop and only that crop  survives so that they can harvest it nice and easily. And I guess, you know, it's a  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:17:27):**  sort of similar situation in the ocean where fishermen have been targeting one species  and if they've caught other species in that bycatch, they've just been chucked away and  that's had an impact on the system. But when we're talking about trying to convince farmers  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:17:41):**  who've been farming perfectly successfully on their own terms for the last generation  or two using that reductionism method, it must be really difficult to change people's  mindsets. And so who is it? Who has their mindset changed? What kind of person is it  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:17:56):**  that has taken to regenerative agriculture on land and what kind of person might it be  that we're searching for if we're talking about this in terms of the ocean?  Oh, that's a big question.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:18:07):**  Yeah, I thought I'd throw you an easy one.  I think in terms of the land, the people who have taken these ideas up are people who have  a sense of the wider ecosystem inherent in them somehow. There is something, perhaps  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:18:24):**  it's a connection to the natural world that is expressed in them. I mean, I was listening  to a farmer talk last night about why he actually grew up in an intensive, son of a farmer,  intensive, you know, standard monoculture grain production type system. And he didn't  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:18:43):**  even want to be a farmer because something about that system he hated, you know, he just  didn't want even to go into farming. So I don't know what it is in somebody, but it's  something in the human spirit that is connected to the land and it's and or the sea, the natural  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:18:57):**  world. So it's trying to somehow reawaken that so that we can tap into it to get that  complexity back. And the complexity for me is the key word. And complexity is a combination  of biodiversity and connectance. So it's not just about having lots of species in the system.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:19:18):**  It's about having the connectivity between them and having that connectivity expressed  so that it's a system that is in constant flux, which means that it has great resilience.  So when something happens, some natural event happens or an anthropogenic event, there is  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:19:34):**  much more resilience in the system. It can bend and it can shift because it's got this  really vibrant, we call them nature's dynamic networks now, which is sometimes called community  dynamics. But it's that idea of all these different species at different trophic levels  
**[0:19:50-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:19:50):**  having this incredibly complicated and dynamic network and web of connections between them,  which can strengthen and weaken and bend and disappear and recreate. And that is what complexity  is and that's what builds stability and resilience.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:20:07):**  MATT WILSON Something we've talked about before on the podcast is the difference between conservation  farming and regenerative agriculture. And when I think of conservation farming, I think  of set aside or a bit of land that's been repurposed as woodland or wildflower meadow.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:20:26):**  I think of the amount of land that's being used to produce food is being reduced and  the likelihood is, if we think of organic farming, case in point, in order to become  an organic farmer, you're likely to see a decrease in your yield. And I think one of  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:20:42):**  the really interesting things about regenerative agriculture is the way in which it combines  this change in mindset and growth in nature, restoration of biodiversity, with the ability  to actually run a viable farm and make money, albeit by farming in a different way. And  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:20:59):**  I feel like that's something that ought to be possible. But it's a story very often we  hear the story about nature with regenerative farming. But actually, there's a really positive  story to tell in terms of farm incomes, either as an individual or at a community level as  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:21:12):**  well. And maybe that's something that we could learn from and get better at telling that  money side of the story that perhaps we feel uncomfortable about with fishermen and people  who are working the seas.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:21:23):**  JILL ROWAN Yeah, I think that's really important. And it's profitability that's the important  thing because the inputs drop so much. It's the profitability that matters. I wonder if  Dylan's got some thoughts about how that would relate to fishing communities.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:21:35):**  DYLAN WALKER Yeah, I think it does. I also think there's something when you were talking  about, you know, who are the people who are kind of driving these concepts forward, and  there tends to be a sort of an understanding of how wildlife works, how ecosystems function.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:21:51):**  And I can't help but feel that there's something in kind of almost breaking down, metaphorically  breaking down the farmer's fence, if you like, this concept of sort of them and us, you know,  keeping out the predators so that we can grow eggs. You could almost draw the same analogy  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:22:09):**  for hauling a net in with your catch and keeping the sharks away. When you look at some of  the regenerative processes, what they tend to be saying is actually we're welcoming all  of those species back. We're accepting that we will lose some of our catch or some of  
**[0:22:27-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:22:27):**  our the crops that we grow to those species. But what they do is they actually enrich our  ecosystem or our production overall. So we're still gaining if even if we lose something  to them. And the fact that they are there tells us that our food production is healthy  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:22:45):**  and our ecosystem is healthy. And I think that's where the, you know, such an important  mindset change. And I think most people are sort of leading with these sorts of regenerative  approaches, both on land and in our oceans understand that.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:22:58):**  I wonder where marine conservation areas, marine conservation zones come in, because  these tend to be and I'm thinking of the Isle of Man here, which is an area that I know  well where, you know, you've got areas of the seabed which are off limits, there's,  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:23:12):**  you know, there's a lot of, you know, scallops and seabed dredging that takes place around  the Isle of Man. But there are areas which have been set aside where there is some really  successful nurseries now for marine life. And as the juvenile shellfish and fish grow  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:23:29):**  within those nursery set aside areas, that then spills out into an area that the fishermen  are still allowed to fish. It seems to me that that's different from what we're talking  about.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:23:40):**  Yeah, I think protected areas, again, I would like to make the comparison between what's  happening on land and what's happening in our oceans. You know, why do we need to protect  areas of land or ocean effectively keep people out of those areas, or limit their access  
**[0:23:57-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:23:57):**  to those areas? We're only doing that because our wider ecosystems are failing, we're losing  species and we're losing habitats. So I personally view protected areas, they're very important,  but they are a stopgap measure. Most conservationists would admit that we can't through protected  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:24:19):**  areas protect all of our species. I mean, in the ocean, as is true on land, we have  many species that are highly, highly migratory. So therefore, you know, these little hotspots  or big hotspots of protected areas cannot protect everything. So they are a stopgap  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:24:35):**  measure. And so therefore, they are not the long term solution. The longer term solution  is both on land and in our oceans is how do we find ways to reintegrate ourselves to animals  as part of these ecosystems back into these ecosystems in a way that regenerates them  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:24:53):**  and provides the resources that we need alongside our fellow animals and plants. And I think  that's the bigger challenge. And in a way, I think that's what's so exciting about a  conversation like this, because if we get regenerative fishing or regenerative ocean  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:25:07):**  farming or whatever we want to call it, right, there might actually be less of a need for  these protected areas. At the moment, these protected areas serve fisheries, they can  be very important for fisheries because they provide a kind of safe haven place for you  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:25:23):**  know, fish or for lobsters or shellfish or whatever to recover and recuperate only because  the areas around them are not being run sustainably.  So this is fascinating, because of course, again, the parallel with land is is there  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:25:38):**  that the conversation that's been taking place over the last decade or even to on land has  been very much about sort of taking these areas away from agriculture and allowing them  to rewild. Very often, there's a term that's used on land in order that those areas can  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:25:52):**  go back to nature, nature can do its thing in these places. And we continue farming here.  So that's your equivalent, I suppose of a marine protected area. But the challenges  on land that that just simply means that the amount of land available for agriculture diminishes,  
**[0:26:07-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:26:07):**  and almost inevitably, it continues to intensify. And this conversation is something in I mean,  Farmwell, my organisation and FAI that that Alex works with, we're very adept at working  within that conversation on land at trying to say, look, that isn't the way that we should  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:26:25):**  be going about allowing our ecosystems to thrive. What we need to do is to integrate  this approach so that all land is delivering multiple outcomes, so that all land is producing  food and mitigating climate change and restoring biodiversity, rather than just allowing these  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:26:43):**  little pockets to be set aside. And it's a conversation that happens at a national level  in the newspapers, there were some really prominent environmentalists who are still  pushing this idea that farming needs to be here. And woodland sequestration, if you like  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:26:58):**  is there and nature goes there. And that somehow we can spare off these things. And it sounds  from what you're saying that that you're in agreement, I guess, with our approach on land  that this is, it's, it's kind of crazy. We, we ought to be working to make the whole system  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:27:16):**  work. Yeah, I think we, you know, we, we can go back to the enclosures act, which took  so many people off the land in our country for the first time, and perhaps sort of say,  well, that that was the beginning of our disconnect with nature. So, you know, as a general rule,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:27:31):**  as a society, I think we should always be saying, how can we integrate and include people  be inclusive, and encourage them onto our land and onto our oceans and across all these  habitats. And obviously, we as human beings utilise different parts of the natural world  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:27:48):**  in different ways, you know, I would love for my children to be able to walk outside  my house and run through a field of organic corn and climb a tree at the end of it and  you know, do something else after that, you know, that I think that the discussion around,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:28:03):**  you know, large tracts of the countryside should be like this. And, you know, other  areas like the uplands, for example, should be, you know, managed in this way is a bit  of a fallacy. And it actually sort of ignores the way that ecosystems really work. Alex  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:28:15):**  was quite right in saying that, you know, the key word here is really diversity. But  we are players in that diversity. We are engineering like there's no tomorrow, give people the  freedom but at the same time, we do need to learn together how we can work in a way that  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:28:32):**  regenerates. The difficulty is, it is hard to value an ecosystem when it is functioning  so much below its potential. You know, we can talk a lot about the sea and how disconnected  we are from the sea, many of us, but there are very few people that are very far disconnected  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:28:48):**  from a river, you know, and those rivers going back a few centuries were absolutely alive  with salmon and trout and eels. And, you know, there's a huge amount of food production from  those rivers when they were cleaner and greener than they are today. So for example, you know,  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:29:05):**  where I live here in East Sussex, there's a small village five miles away from me, which  is four miles inland, not river. And in the records of the church there, going back 800  years, you know, they were landing harbour porpoises in considerable numbers, they were  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:29:23):**  eating them. Now, I've been looking at across our piece of the English Channel here in Sussex  for 20 years, I have yet to see a harbour porpoise. So you can argue 800 years is a  long time, but it's really not. So we know that our ecosystem was so much more productive,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:29:38):**  and that people were linking the sea with the land through food production, going back  through millennia really. So really, you know, there isn't much of a disconnect in terms  of the potential. You go over to the west coast of Canada now and see those great runs  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:29:53):**  of salmon, you know, that's what it used to be like here. So you know, I think it's about  us trying to rewind and reconnect and think about, oh, you know, we've got some fabulous  business potential here, there's an amazing food growing potential here, and it's going  
**[0:30:08-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:30:08):**  to lead to tastier, bigger and more fish and other species that we can eat and enjoy and  enjoy in the wild as well. So it's so much potential, but we have to remind ourselves  what there was and work towards regenerating that and that is really the purpose of this  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-oceans-eej1d8#t=0:30:25):**  whole discussion, isn't it, is to explore that potential.  I think that's all we've got time for.

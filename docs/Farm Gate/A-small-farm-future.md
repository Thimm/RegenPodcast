### Farm Gate  (Thu, 21 Jul 2022 13:30:43)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Costayne, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:09):**  of the Food and Global Security Network. Many governments see farm expansion and aggregation  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:15):**  as the future for agriculture, but there's a grave risk that this will simply embed the  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:19):**  structural inequity and external social and ecological costs inherent in today's food  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:25):**  system. Instead, we need diversity in terms of production, cropping, distribution and  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:30):**  diet and of course diversity in terms of farm scale, output and business structure.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:36):**  Small farms play a critical role and who better to tell us why than Chris Smage, the author  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:41):**  of A Small Farm Future, published by Chelsea Green. Chris is a social scientist and a small  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:46):**  farmer himself who studied global economic systems and specialised in peasant studies.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:51):**  Chris, welcome. Let's go straight in for the big one. What's your vision of a small farm  
**[0:00:56-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:56):**  future?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:00:57):**  Hi Finnlow. Well, yeah, thanks very much for having me. When we talk about a vision, I  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:01):**  guess one aspect of my book is that this is not necessarily what I want to see, but what  
**[0:01:07-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:07):**  I think is going to happen. I mean, as you were saying, there's all sorts of good reasons  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:10):**  to have diversity and smaller farms and so on within the existing landscape. You know,  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:16):**  I think there are some sort of big crises that are kind of pushing us in a very different  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:22):**  direction. And I think to get to your question, you know, what do I think the future will  
**[0:01:26-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:26):**  look like? I think, you know, we've got huge problems with climate and water availability.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:32):**  It's going to be a future with less easy energy availability. I think that's going to push  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:38):**  people, you know, we're going to see more people living in the countryside relative  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:42):**  to the cities. So I think more people sort of trying to create a basic livelihood locally,  
**[0:01:49-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:49):**  more gardening relative to arable or livestock farming, more job rich sort of focus on creating  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:01:58):**  basic food and fibre commodities locally, more small holding. So yeah, a more, a kind  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:04):**  of more peopled rural landscape with more of a focus on producing a diversity of food  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:10):**  and fibre crops locally for people's immediate needs. And you know, in many ways, I think  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:15):**  that is quite an enticing vision, but I'm under no illusion that it's also a challenging  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:20):**  one that's, you know, a lot of the things that we take for granted and particularly  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:24):**  the kind of easy availability of energy that's going to be less available and that's going  
**[0:02:29-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:29):**  to have huge implications.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:30):**  So for you, small farms and home farms, home allotments, if you like, and short supply  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:36):**  chains are essential to reset a societal balance and to fill economic and perhaps ecological  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:42):**  gaps that can't be addressed by large retailers and corporations. Why do you think that this  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:47):**  sort of farming is so undervalued by governments?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:50):**  Well, I mean, it's partly that obviously we've sort of been through this, you know, whole  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:02:54):**  historic period of great sort of centralisation of government power and productivism as a  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:01):**  result basically of the availability of cheap energy and cheap capital. So, you know, governments  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:07):**  tend to sort of think big, you know, they don't want to be dealing with some kind of  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:11):**  smallholder in Somerset like me, you know, they want to be dealing with Sainsbury's or  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:15):**  the COP26 meeting, you know, you get Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos there, you don't get  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:20):**  the likes of me. So there's that kind of massification sort of centralised element to it. I mean,  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:27):**  you know, with a more political hat on, I'd say also governments actively don't want people  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:31):**  like me. There's a whole set of structures that are designed to stop people like me getting  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:35):**  hold of a small bit of land and being self reliant, you know, because that doesn't suit  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:39):**  governments for all sorts of reasons. But you know, also there is...  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:42):**  Why is that though? Why is that? Why are these structures in place? And you mentioned COP26.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:47):**  And while you're right, the likes of Sainsbury's will have, you know, very significant lobbying  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:51):**  power there, not least because they're well known brands and they have the money to make  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:03:56):**  sure that their lobbyists are ever present. But at the same time, there are people like  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:01):**  you at COP. There are indigenous populations that get represented at COP increasingly,  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:07):**  but at the same time, we're still not hearing these voices or we're still not valuing these  
**[0:04:12-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:12):**  voices.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:13):**  Yeah, I mean, well, that's right. And I think it's partly that it just, I think there is  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:17):**  a recognition that wider voices have to be heard and have to be somehow figured in, but  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:21):**  it's the somehow figuring in that is the problem. And it's partly that, you know, we've got  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:26):**  this model of economic growth, of financialisation, that, you know, a government that kind of  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:32):**  says, no, actually, we're going to be self-reliant in our agriculture, we're going to relocalise,  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:36):**  we're going to, you know, just have people producing local food and fibre. You know,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:41):**  that is a very hard thing to do in the context of global governance and sort of global economic  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:47):**  imperatives. So, you know, to be fair to them, it's not really going to happen except through  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:52):**  systemic breakdown, which we are beginning to see, unfortunately. It's easy to pay lip  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:04:57):**  service to the idea of consulting wider voices and indigenous people and so on, but it's  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:02):**  very hard to internalise that into existing models, which are essentially about return  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:07):**  on investment and increasing financialisation.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:11):**  Is it that they don't value you? I mean, I know the premise of my question was that they  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:14):**  don't, but is it that they don't value you or that they just think that that sort of  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:19):**  small economy will exist anyway? And is it that instead of just accepting that it will  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:25):**  exist, there needs to be a strategy to actually create growth within that particular sector?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:31):**  Yeah, I mean, I suppose my point of departure in my writing is that, you know, it would  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:36):**  be great if there was a strategy to do that, but I'm not holding my breath, you know, I  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:40):**  don't think that's what's driving government. So, you know, a lot of our stuff is very much  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:45):**  just get on with it, grassroots, under the radar. The reality is that there's not very  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:50):**  many people kind of building this kind of local alternative agrarian economy. And so  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:05:55):**  it sort of becomes easy to sort of say, yeah, well, you know, it's lovely you being on your  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:00):**  small holding, you know, raising a few sheep and having a veg garden, but you know, that  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:04):**  doesn't really address the, you know, the real problems of the world. And my argument  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:08):**  is that, well, you know, it doesn't because the world has gone in a particular direction  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:12):**  that has marginalised that, but that direction ultimately is unsustainable. So, whether we  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:17):**  like it or not, we are going to swing back to more of this kind of local distributed  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:23):**  kind of economy. And the question is whether we do that in a sort of orderly and thoughtful  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:29):**  way or whether it happens by default in ways that may be less appealing.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:34):**  If we look back to the Second World War and the decades beyond the Second World War, most  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:39):**  of the families in Britain who had any land at all would be producing at least some of  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:43):**  their food. Now, I wonder why that's changed. Is it that food has just become so cheap and  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:48):**  easy to access that we don't need to grow our own? Is it that priorities have changed  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:53):**  and people are more interested in leisure and having gardens and lawns or that people  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:06:58):**  are going out to work and just don't simply have the time to produce their own food?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:03):**  Well, I think there's a lot of different factors, many of which you touched on. I mean, you  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:07):**  know, part of what we had in the post-war period was this huge kind of global economic  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:12):**  growth and at the same time a huge amount of mechanisation and, you know, a lot of the  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:17):**  kind of modern package of farming in terms of machinery and pesticides, herbicides and  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:23):**  so on. So, I think it was sort of understandable in that post-war moment to move in that different  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:28):**  direction, urbanisation, bigger farms, concentration, mechanisation. I think we're kind of reaping  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:34):**  the sort of negatives of that in some ways now and, you know, food prices are beginning  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:40):**  to rise for all sorts of reasons. You know, we've sort of put too many of our eggs in  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:44):**  one basket to use a good old-fashioned agricultural metaphor, you know, the sort of red basket  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:50):**  regions like Ukraine, Russia and, you know, North America. We rely too much on, you know,  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:07:55):**  this handful of global commodity crops produced in a relatively small parts of the world.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:01):**  And, you know, that all worked okay for a brief period and we had this huge sort of  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:06):**  global industrial growth. I think that's all beginning to unravel now. And, you know, the  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:11):**  sort of thing about work and leisure is interesting. There are many more leisure opportunities  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:16):**  nowadays but there is also this, you know, very rigorous emphasis on work. You know,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:20):**  we've got to be working all the time, we've got to be earning, you know, and it's very  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:23):**  different from the sort of rhythms of a, you know, of a garden or a small farm or a small  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:28):**  holding. There's a strange coalition emerging of politicians  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:32):**  and environmentalists both pushing for corporate ownership of food. The UK government seems  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:37):**  entirely content with big farms gobbling up ever larger parcels of land. And then people  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:43):**  like George Monbiot appear to fantasise about the end of agriculture itself with real food  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:48):**  produced by synthetic lab-grown nutritional nuggets that are almost certainly produced  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:53):**  by the same corporations that have been intensifying meat production all these years. So this is  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:08:58):**  clearly the antithesis of the small farm. But I wonder in your vision of the future,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:04):**  in your idea of what's going to take place, what's going to be necessary, do larger farm  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:09):**  businesses and food corporations exist at all?  
**[0:09:12-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:12):**  I mean, it depends, I guess, on how, you know, how far we project this vision into the future.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:18):**  I mean, my, there is a case for larger farms and businesses, certainly at the present,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:24):**  but I think the politics that are driving my analysis are a kind of grassroots bottom  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:30):**  up local politics. Certainly we have to collaborate with each other locally and beyond locally  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:36):**  and kind of build up collective institutions, you know, co-operative skills and so on. You  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:42):**  know, there's all sorts of ways that we can frame that.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:45):**  So those are larger businesses. It's just that they're not necessarily the big corporations  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:49):**  that we have now.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:50):**  Yeah, yeah. And I think we need to take a much more long term vision. I mean, I, you  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:09:55):**  know, I don't think the notion of the corporation, the sort of big transnational business that  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:00):**  is basically very much bound up with government as well, you know, there's this sort of, you  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:07):**  know, we still have this slightly romantic notion of the private sector as, you know,  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:11):**  some kind of wily entrepreneur who comes up with this great idea and it catches on and  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:17):**  they make money. But, you know, basically corporations have always been in with government,  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:22):**  you know, it's been sort of two sides of the same coin. And, you know, I think I don't  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:27):**  really see that as being the way forward long term. I mean, it's funny you mentioned George's  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:32):**  book, you know, another book I read recently was called Sand Talk by an Australian Aboriginal  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:38):**  thinker Tyson Yunkaporta. And I mean, it's amazing. And his book is kind of how indigenous  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:43):**  wisdom can inform, you know, our thinking today. And it's amazing reading his book where,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:48):**  you know, you think of this Aboriginal culture that survived for 10s of 1000s of years in  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:53):**  Australia. And we don't, you know, it's just having that mindset of, you know, is this  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:10:58):**  idea that I have now, is this going to be a good idea when we look at it 30,000 years  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:03):**  down the line? And I kind of think we need a little bit more of that kind of time framing  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:08):**  rather than, you know, is this going to make some money or is this going to immediately  
**[0:11:12-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:12):**  solve some problem that we have, you know, right now this year? And I think if we take  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:16):**  that more, that kind of longer term perspective, I mean, who knows, obviously, what you know,  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:21):**  what kind of institutions will be over that timeframe, but I don't think the existing  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:26):**  large scale corporate business that's wrapped up, you know, as you were saying earlier,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:30):**  with COP26 and all that, I don't really see that as providing the answers. I think the  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:35):**  answers are going to come from people locally sort of building bottom up, you know, working  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:40):**  with other people and kind of innovating at that level.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:44):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:48):**  It seems to me that it's almost this kind of illusion of the Adam Smith ideal, which  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:11:56):**  is almost fetishised, which often is misrepresented and misunderstood. And the idea that if the  
**[0:12:02-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:02):**  customer can see a range of different products all competing with each other in the marketplace,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:09):**  then they can make an informed choice, the invisible hand of the market will guide. But  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:14):**  actually, that doesn't exist. If it ever existed, it doesn't now because the marketplace is  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:18):**  so ordered by these corporations, so ordered by government.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:23):**  Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, I, you know, I talk a little bit about Adam Smith in my  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:27):**  book and some of the other sort of pioneering economists who, you know, in some ways, I  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:32):**  think Smith, he saw the world that was coming and he, you know, in many ways, he didn't  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:37):**  particularly like it and was, you know, he offered some pretty trenching criticisms of  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:42):**  the direction that it was going in. But he also kind of theorised it in ways that kind  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:48):**  of no longer really seem appropriate. But you know, one thing he did do, you know, he  
**[0:12:52-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:12:52):**  was quite grounded in the idea of kind of well established local economic development  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:00):**  rather than global trade and financialisation, which of course, in his day was minuscule  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:05):**  compared to what we have now. So Adam Smith was talking about what he called unnatural  
**[0:13:11-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:11):**  development, which was kind of an over reliance on financialisation, speculation, commerce,  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:18):**  rather than building a stable agrarian and to some extent, industrial base, you know,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:24):**  so I think we need to, you know, we need to be thinking about building that base in a  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:28):**  different kind of way to how we've been accustomed to in recent years.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:32):**  I want to come back to George Monbiot because he has such a large and influential platform.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:37):**  And Monbiot is a person who appears to set academic science on a pedestal, while at the  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:43):**  same time hugely undervaluing the lived experience of farmers. Now, your background is part academic,  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:50):**  part pastoral. And in your book, you say, I don't think a commitment to science as transcendent  
**[0:13:55-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:55):**  truth will end well. What do you mean?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:13:57):**  Well, yeah, George is a good example. I've just, I've just finished reading his book,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:01):**  actually. And it's a case in point where he talks about the degree of urbanisation as  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:06):**  a matter of mathematics, he kind of says, you know, you can't argue with arithmetic.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:12):**  We all live in cities a long way away from where food is produced. So you know, we all  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:17):**  this kind of local agriculture stuff is a lovely idea. But you know, it's not going  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:21):**  to work in the face of the arithmetic. My argument is, well, it's not about arithmetic,  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:26):**  it's about politics, economics, social history. And you can, you know, you can absolutely  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:32):**  argue with the way that's turned out. And that's kind of what I mean about science as  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:36):**  a transcendent truth. I mean, I'm not arguing with the scientific method, you know, you  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:41):**  can, you can do a bunch of experiments and prove that the that the earth is round, you  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:46):**  know, I'm not questioning that. But I think we've got into this whole way of thinking  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:50):**  about science, which is not actually a scientific way of thinking. It's a science as this kind  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:14:56):**  of cultural artifact. It's all bound up religious artifact. It is it is, I mean, it is a kind  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:01):**  of form of, you know, people talk about scientism rather than science as a kind of modern religion.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:07):**  And it's bound up with cultural notions of progress of new technologies being kind of  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:12):**  good in and of themselves. And what I'm arguing is that that, you know, if we I mean, again,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:17):**  you know, George's precision fermentation thing is a case in point, if we say, well,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:22):**  you know, these clever scientists, they've got this, they've got the food system all  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:26):**  worked out, they can produce this food, it's not going to have any ecological impact, we  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:30):**  can just eat it. It's this is scientific, this is modern. I think that's going to lead  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:35):**  to all sorts of problems that is not really going to deliver the kind of society you want.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:40):**  It's going to, it's going to deliver people who are very much alienated from being a living  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:45):**  breathing organisms in the world. And it's, you know, and as you say, it's going to deliver  
**[0:15:49-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:49):**  more power to corporate and government sort of top down ways of thinking. So it's in that  
**[0:15:55-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:55):**  sense that...  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:56):**  Jason Vale... And of course, if you're talking about ecological  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:15:57):**  impacts, or if George is, then, a, we don't know what the ecological impacts of scaling  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:03):**  that type of vat-produced food really is. But at the same time, there's a huge knock  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:08):**  on environmental impact of undermining the way that the countryside is organised and  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:14):**  taking a living out of the countryside so that suddenly there's, there's nobody left  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:19):**  to manage it. And seeing as so much of the degradation has been actively managed over  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:24):**  the course of the last hundred or 200 years, we need to actively manage the restoration  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:29):**  and regeneration of the countryside.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:30):**  I mean, I certainly think we need to put ourselves back into the landscape and be that's one  
**[0:16:45-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:45):**  of the arguments for localism, I think is that, you know, if you go to the shop and  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:16:56):**  you go to the agrarian economy, you know, you're much more immediately faced with the  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:01):**  circumstances and the consequences of your production. And you can see, you know, if  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:06):**  you sort of financialise the agrarian system globally, and you know, there's loads of interesting  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:12):**  studies of this, you know, shrimp farming in Bangladesh, for example, you know, if you  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:18):**  kind of financialise it as a way of developing or as a way of adapting to, you know, particularly  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:23):**  changing ecological circumstances, you know, if you're doing that in a global context,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:29):**  the local consequences of that can be really disastrous. And then if you add, add all those  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:34):**  local consequences up globally, that's where we, you know, you get into the mess that we're  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:38):**  in. So actually, re-emplacing ourselves in the landscape, you know, that's a really critical,  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:44):**  you know, argument or basis of this argument for localism is that, you know, if you were  
**[0:17:48-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:48):**  a farmer, if you are producing your livelihood, you know, you have to do that in a thoughtful  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:53):**  long term way. And it kind of overcomes. I mean, you know, I'm not saying that it's perfect,  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:17:58):**  and everyone then becomes, you know, kind of wonderful ecological steward, but that's  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:03):**  kind of the direction we've got to go in rather than just offloading the responsibility onto  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:07):**  somebody else, onto scientists or governments, you know, to sort of do that thinking for  
**[0:18:13-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:13):**  us.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:14):**  So in terms of the balance between science and lived experience, it's not necessarily  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:17):**  that science should be seen as less important, but that the lived experience of individual  
**[0:18:22-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:22):**  farmers should become better valued?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:24):**  Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, it's a tremendously difficult thing to be a farmer,  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:30):**  well, all throughout history, but certainly, nowadays, you know, you've got, you know,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:35):**  you're expected to have a business that stacks up at some level financially, you're expected  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:41):**  to produce cheap food that the consumer wants, and you're expected to look after the environment  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:47):**  and you know, you can't really do all of those things within the way it's framed. So yeah,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:51):**  you know, I think we do need to value farmers' inputs and farmers' experience. And I think,  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:18:57):**  you know, the way historically there's, I think we've thought about farm extension in  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:02):**  better ways than we now do. It's almost like extension has been outsourced to big corporations,  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:07):**  you know, trying to sell, you know, whatever their sort of agrochemicals or agri products  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:11):**  are. And then there's quite a lot of regulation, you know, it's quite top down, you know, you  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:15):**  mustn't do this, you must do that. So, you know, again, I'm always arguing the case for  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:21):**  sort of bottom up grassroots, what we need is farmers to be helped and to help each other  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:26):**  to be better farmers, you know, to value their experience and to try and make it easier for  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:33):**  them to do all of those things, you know, to produce good food, to live a viable lifestyle  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:37):**  and to look after the environment.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:39):**  Jason Vale And to value these things at all scales as  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:41):**  well, because, you know, I think that there is a degree to which farmers who've got a  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:46):**  couple of hundred acres or maybe 500, even 1000 acres, don't necessarily think of the  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:51):**  small farmer with, you know, three acres and a cow in the same category. And actually,  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:56):**  a lot of the knowledge, even though there's a different scale, a lot of that knowledge  
**[0:19:59-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:19:59):**  sharing is relevant in both directions.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:02):**  Ian Marber Yeah, I mean, part of my shtick, I think,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:04):**  is to sort of try and break down that distinction between, you know, the farmer, the sort of  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:10):**  stereotype of the farmer as, you know, like this huge farm with just one or two people  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:14):**  sitting in a big tractor and more amateur, you know, amateur growers, you know, I like  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:19):**  to say, you know, you've got a few herbs on a, you know, in a pot on a window ledge in  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:23):**  a high rise, you know, you're a farmer, you know, I mean, let's, let's all be part of  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:28):**  this process of producing food. I mean, I think there is a problem, there's a kind of  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:32):**  missing middle, you know, it's, it's relatively easy, you know, like, I occasionally raise  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:37):**  a couple of wieners on my holding here. And then, you know, there's a pig farmer down  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:42):**  the road, he's got a couple of thousand, you know, but there isn't, you don't tend to have  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:45):**  someone who's raising kind of one or 200 pigs for the local market. And obviously, there's  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:51):**  sort of issues there about fodder production and so on, you know, but yeah, you know, I  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:54):**  think we need to embrace all scales and be talking to each other across those scales.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:20:59):**  But we, you know, going back to some of your earlier questions, you know, the way that  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:03):**  the economics have driven this is that there isn't all that much between big scale mechanised  
**[0:21:08-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:08):**  farming and sort of amateur gardening or small holding and we sort of need to be stitching  
**[0:21:14-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:14):**  all that back together at different levels, I think.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:16):**  Jason Vale-  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:14):**  One of the key themes in your book is the political economy, the idea that the economy  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:22):**  and the way that we order society is the result of political choices. Now, I know we've touched  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:27):**  on this a little bit already, but could you tell us a bit more about that?  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:31):**  Richard Clark- Yeah, I mean, it's, again, it's a little  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:33):**  bit like the discussion we just had about science, you know, we nowadays we tend to  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:37):**  talk about the economy as this, almost like this force of nature over which we have no  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:43):**  control, you know, the science dictates that we do this, the economy dictates that we do  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:48):**  that. And really, the point of talking about political economy is just to emphasise that  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:53):**  this is a human artifice that we've created, and we have choices and control over it, which  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:21:59):**  you know, going back to that discussion about the likes of Adam Smith and David Ricardo,  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:03):**  they were much more aware that what we call the economy emerged from social conflicts  
**[0:22:10-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:10):**  or classes, social forces within society, landowners, industrialist workers, and so  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:16):**  on. I mean, that's only one framing you can put around it. But it's, you know, the idea  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:20):**  is that the economy is not something out there over which we have no control, but emerges  
**[0:22:26-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:26):**  from the political choices that we make.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:28):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:35):**  You know, you talk there about economy being seen as a almost a force of nature. And we  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:41):**  think in terms of the laws of nature, you know, sort of basic things like gravity, but  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:46):**  when we're taught economics, economics also has its own laws. So, is all economics political?  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:51):**  Or are there still some fundamental laws governing things like supply and demand and price rises?  
**[0:22:56-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:56):**  Adam Smith Great question. I mean, I would say yes,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:22:59):**  all economics is political, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's only political.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:05):**  I mean, supply and demand is an interesting one. You know, as I studied anthropology,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:10):**  and it was a big debate in anthropology some years ago. You know, if you look at societies  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:16):**  that are very different from our own, you know, like in sort of New Guinea or somewhere,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:20):**  you know, does market supply and demand operate in the same way? I think really, the answer  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:25):**  is no, it doesn't. And, you know, modern people trying to reform economic thinking now, like  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:30):**  Kate Raworth, you know, she says, once people have learned to sort of, you know, a supply  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:35):**  and demand graph, they're sort of lost, you know. So, I kind of think, you know, it is  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:39):**  very deeply political. But having said that, you know, you talked about laws of nature,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:44):**  I think in as much as there are economic laws, they're actually the points at which human  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:49):**  society interacts with the natural world, which is why farming and food is so critical,  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:54):**  I think, because that's exactly where society meets nature. You know, there are certain  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:23:58):**  things that we can't just kind of politic our way out of. So, you know, obviously, at  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:03):**  the moment, the big story is fuel prices, you know, so sure, the government could say,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:09):**  okay, petrol is going to be 50p a litre instead of two quid, but that will have consequences,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:15):**  you know, you can't, it's not a matter of politics, just in that, you know, you can  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:18):**  sort of wave a wand or say by fear, you know, this is how it is. And obviously, you know,  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:23):**  you could say there are laws of supply and demand in as much as we have this huge complex  
**[0:24:28-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:28):**  social structure, kind of institutional structure built around a certain way of thinking about  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:34):**  commodities and trade and money and so on. So, although ultimately, I would argue that  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:40):**  is a political choice, you know, there's a kind of path dependency, so you can't just  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:45):**  kind of abolish it by, you know, by passing a law in the House of Commons, you know, but  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:49):**  ultimately the things that are really driving it, you know, they are things like energy,  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:24:54):**  water, soil, you know, some of these more fundamental natural forces are the things  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:00):**  that are going to drive change because you can't just kind of conjure energy out of nowhere,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:04):**  you know, if you strip your soil bare, you can't then farm it next year, you know, those  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:08):**  are the real laws of nature that I think, you know, we have to pay attention to.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:13):**  Mason So, you've got laws of nature and then built on top of that are these assumptions rather than laws that we make about economics.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:21):**  I'm really interested, I'm really pleased to hear you talking about the way in which  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:25):**  different cultures and different places around the world have a different understanding of  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:29):**  supply and demand because I can remember, you know, my GCSE and when I tried to question,  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:33):**  you know, the basic laws of supply and demand and say that it was more complicated and that  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:37):**  society, you know, kind of got in the way of some of these economic theories, I tell  
**[0:25:42-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:42):**  you, it really didn't go down well.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:44):**  David Yeah, it's very entrenched, very entrenched  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:48):**  that way of thinking. It's almost like this kind of recursive model where we kind of set  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:52):**  up a certain way of doing things and then we, you know, we describe how it works in  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:25:58):**  terms of these kind of law like generalisations, but you know, which sort of work, you know,  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:03):**  because we've chosen and set up these institutions that operate in that way, but the economic  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:09):**  historian pioneering economic historian, Carl Polanyi, you know, he talked about land, labour  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:15):**  and money as the fictitious commodities, because we treat land as if it's something that  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:20):**  you can just buy and sell, but actually for a whole bunch of reasons, you know, you can't  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:24):**  really do that long term. In my book, I talk about problems of the symbolic economy, you  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:30):**  know, humans are great at inventing, we sort of, we're brilliant at inventing all these  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:34):**  ways of relating to each other and money, you know, is an amazing thing which generates  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:38):**  this huge amount of activity and interaction. But ultimately, it does meet these, the way  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:44):**  you framed it, these real natural laws, you know, you can't produce more food than you  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:49):**  can produce, you can't conjure energy out of nowhere. And so ultimately, there are other  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:54):**  realities and there are other ways of thinking about those things, you know, going back to  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:26:58):**  someone like Tyson Yoonka Porter, you know, these much more long term ways of thinking  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:02):**  about how we emplace ourselves in the landscape that I think are important.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:07):**  And it's interesting, actually, that even the markets in land and, you know, the buying  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:12):**  and selling of land have changed, or are changing at the moment with this idea of natural capital  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:18):**  and the way in which, you know, land is more than just a place, it is a bundle of ecological  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:25):**  outcomes and potentially social capital outcomes as well.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:29):**  And also, you know, a big problem with land is, you know, the old Mark Twain joke that,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:34):**  you know, buy land because they're making it anymore, you know, it's, you know, you  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:37):**  can't just keep producing more land. And that has all sorts of implications in terms of  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:43):**  the demand, you know, the price for land, which sort of inflates it beyond, and housing  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:47):**  too, you know, that inflates it beyond what a lot of people can afford.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:50):**  You know, it's really fascinating that you bring up the quote from Mark Twain there,  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:54):**  that the thing about land is they're not making it anymore. But actually, when I talk to regenerative  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:27:59):**  or agroecological farmers around the world, it's one of the things that they, they actually  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:04):**  contest. They say, you know, what they are doing is creating more soil. And so, although  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:09):**  that horizontal amount of land is not expanding, what they're doing is building it. And then  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:14):**  they talk in terms of vertical real estate, where you're growing taller grasses because  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:18):**  your land is functioning better, therefore you're getting more volume of grass and swab  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:24):**  out of the same parcel of land. So that's a really interesting dichotomy as well.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:28):**  No, I mean, I'd go along with that. I mean, I think sometimes people can over press that  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:34):**  argument and sort of say, you know, that we can sort of produce infinite amounts of food  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:38):**  or whatever from tiny areas. But nevertheless, I agree that, you know, people are effectively  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:43):**  creating more land. And that's, you know, partly through knowledge and sort of practical  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:49):**  skills, science, if you like, and also through labour, you know, through, you know, through  
**[0:28:53-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:28:53):**  bringing more considered complex human labour to bear, which is, you know, one reason why  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:00):**  sort of big scale mechanisation, which tends to, I think, oversimplify, you know, we need  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:05):**  to be complicating the ways that we produce things. And that involves sort of bringing  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:10):**  people back into the picture. And actually, yes, it's not just even human  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:15):**  labour, but, but the labour of humans, recruiting nature as, as a farm worker in itself and  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:21):**  using livestock. So you've got, you know, labour coming from many different sources,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:26):**  all integrating to sort of create this additional capacity or to restore the original capacity  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:31):**  of the land. Chris, in your book, you outline 10 existential crises from climate and soil  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:37):**  to economy and culture. And we've touched on a few of these. We don't have time to go  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:41):**  into all of them, but the first crisis that you write about and that we haven't talked  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:45):**  about yet is population. Are there too many people?  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:48):**  Right. I'm going to channel my inner politician in trying to answer that question by not saying  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:53):**  either yes or no. I mean, one of the funny things is that some people raise this issue,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:29:59):**  oh, there's too many people, but you know, you can't wish people away except in sort  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:04):**  of, you know, fairly draconian and wicked ways. And I think the reality is that most  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:09):**  people agree that, you know, what we need is voluntary control over our fertility. The  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:14):**  flaw in that line of thinking is if we could just have fewer of us, then we could carry  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:17):**  on sort of doing the things that we're doing and it would be easier. The reason that the  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:23):**  world is so heavily populated is part of the same reasons impelling this kind of, you know,  
**[0:30:29-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:29):**  what I've called the symbolic economy, you know, certain ways of organising ourselves,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:36):**  ways of producing food. So it's, you know, we need to sort of get at the underlying structure  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:41):**  of that, you know, so population, you know, it might be a problem in some places, but  
**[0:30:46-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:46):**  it's a kind of proximal problem and we need to get at the underlying problem.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:50):**  Jason Vale And increasingly there's research that shows  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:53):**  that if we amend the diets that we have, if we reduce the extractive activity on the land,  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:30:59):**  then actually we can feed perfectly easily the nine, 10 billion people that are forecast  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:03):**  if we waste less, that it's about resources and it's about the way that we manage the  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:09):**  land that we have.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:10):**  Yeah, I mean, I think it's, you know, you hear these figures that we're going to need,  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:16):**  you know, 50% or 70% more food, which is odd because it's not, there's not going to be  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:18):**  that many more people and, you know, actually population growth rates are reducing. So yeah,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:23):**  I think, you know, it's not really a problem of total food supply. I mean, I don't dispute,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:30):**  you know, the argument of someone like George is that we do have this enormous agricultural  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:34):**  footprint on the planet and, you know, I don't dispute that, but it's not a matter of like  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:39):**  having to extend that, as you say, you know, there's, there's all sorts of ways we can  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:43):**  be smarter about how we produce things, what we produce that begin to reduce that footprint.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:49):**  It's interesting, isn't it? That people seem to look at this trajectory of increasing numbers  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:31:55):**  of humans on the planet as if they need to provide for them in precisely the same way  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:00):**  they'd be provided for and not question the choices that they make. And so there is this,  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:06):**  this sort of notion that if we're going to have 3 billion more people, then we have to  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:10):**  produce the same sort of food in the same sort of way for those 3 million people, rather  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:15):**  than addressing the issues of waste, rather than addressing the issues of what people  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:20):**  are choosing to eat. And that has always seemed to me, I mean, crazy.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:24):**  Maybe it's a tall order, but we need to move away from this notion of consumerism, where  
**[0:32:30-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:30):**  there's the sort of notion that people should demand whatever they demand. And then we need  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:34):**  a structure of economic production to meet that demand. Now, I think we need to move  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:39):**  more towards producerism, you know, people as producers of their own livelihoods in kind  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:45):**  of development studies, there's a notion of livelihoods and how poor people kind of stitch  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:49):**  together a complex livelihood through sort of pragmatic means. And we need to sort of  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:54):**  start thinking about all our livelihoods in that sort of way, you know, how can I live  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:32:58):**  a good life on the basis of the renewable resources that are available to me, and I  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:03):**  think that will push us in a different direction and more towards, you know, where we came  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:08):**  into this discussion, you know, what does the future look like? It looks like having  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:12):**  more people on the land thinking through the constraints that the land imposes on them  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:17):**  and sort of how to generate a good livelihood out of that. And that will include the things  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:22):**  you were just talking about, sort of agroecological, you know, regenerative forms of farming, where,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:27):**  you know, people can be really creative in terms of how they do that, but they kind of  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:31):**  need to be on the land doing it, thinking about it. And, you know, that's why I argue  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:35):**  for a small farm future.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:36):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:38):**  So that's, you know, at the heart of that is a land appropriate food production. And  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:41):**  part of that is a more land appropriate national diet. And of course, you know, in many of  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:46):**  the poorer societies around the world, their diets are already fairly land appropriate.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:51):**  So really what we're talking about is kind of, you know, large Western economies remembering  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:33:56):**  to start eating the sorts of foods again, that are appropriate for the land and the  
**[0:34:02-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:02):**  landscape that they come from.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:03):**  Richard Clark,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:04):**  Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, we definitely need to develop local food cultures, which,  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:09):**  you know, in some places, there's been more historical continuity than in others. I mean,  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:13):**  I think in the UK, because we sort of industrialised and urbanised very early, you don't sort of  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:19):**  get that, you know, that sort of terroir kind of idea or that, you know, I mean, obviously,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:23):**  we do have our sort of local foods and so on. But, you know, it's quite weak. And the  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:29):**  reality, you know, as I said earlier, we've got, you know, something like 75% of global  
**[0:34:34-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:34):**  cropland is devoted to just 10 crops, you know, six of which are cereals, two of which  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:38):**  are legumes. And, I mean, obviously, we grow, you know, wheat, rice and maize, obviously  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:42):**  being big ones. And, you know, we grow those crops, you know, because they're great crops,  
**[0:34:46-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:46):**  and, you know, in many ways, and do a lot of things we want, but you know, you can have  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:50):**  too much of a good thing, you know, and that's why, you know, again, I argue for horticulture  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:55):**  for a more sort of integrated approach rather than just wheat, soy or whatever, you know,  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:34:59):**  that sort of, you know, it ticks the sort of macronutrient box. And so, let's produce  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:03):**  as much of it as we can and then kind of package it in endless fancy ways in the supermarket,  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:10):**  you know, we, you know, we need to embrace a more diverse local food culture.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:15):**  Jason Vale-  
**[0:35:22-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:22):**  Another thing you talk about is a future demographic and sociological shift away from the economic  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:26):**  dynamism that brought people into cities and back towards rural areas where people will  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:28):**  start to live more simply, perhaps, and grow more of their own food. Now, surely, the big  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:32):**  challenge here, particularly in Western economies like the UK, is land ownership. Are you expecting  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:38):**  some sort of return to a society of peasants and gentry? And if not, do we need a revolution?  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:45):**  Richard Clark- I'm going to have to channel my politician  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:48):**  again and sort of try and answer sort of neither of the above. I mean, no, no, God help us.  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:54):**  I don't want the society of lords and peasants. So yeah, there does need to be land reform.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:35:59):**  I mean, you know, it's an interesting one because I think land ownership, people often  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:03):**  say, you know, you want to take us back to a sort of feudal society, but we don't have  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:07):**  the structure of certainly, say, contemporary Britain. I don't think there's a kind of feudal  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:12):**  society waiting in the wings. Like, feudal societies were based on kind of warrior aristocracies,  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:18):**  you know, which we don't have, although we do have kind of incipient warrior aristocracies.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:24):**  So we need to sort of nip that in the bud, I think. And I think partly that's going to  
**[0:36:28-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:28):**  happen through pressure on land, through migration, you know, through the need to access land  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:33):**  for all the reasons we were talking about earlier. As to a revolution, I mean, I don't  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:38):**  know, where I am here is sort of the heartlands of the Pitchfork Rebellion that didn't turn  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:43):**  out all that well for the rebels. But then not too many years after the end of it, James  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:47):**  II was out on his ear and some of what the rebels had wanted happened anyway. So I kind  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:36:53):**  of think, I do think we need land reform and we need to confront injustice. You know, we  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:00):**  need a bit of civil disobedience and a bit of kind of rattling the cage. You know, I  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:06):**  don't sort of think that the examples of revolution that are available from recent history, which  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:12):**  kind of were all peasant revolutions, ultimately, sort of at moments of the kind of introduction  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:17):**  of modernization and a monetary economy, I don't think they have many lessons for where  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:22):**  we are right now in a country like the UK. But we do need land reform, we do need partly  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:27):**  just housing, you know, there's a sort of intergenerational injustice, we need young  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:31):**  people to be able to access housing, but we also need wider access to land for sure. So,  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:37):**  you know, we do need some quick thinking about land reform.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:40):**  And of course, revolution is a societal response to political failure, ultimately, isn't it?  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:45):**  And so yeah, yeah, it is. And it's, you know, part of the problem is, I don't think sort  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:50):**  of saying, you know, the sort of present lot in government are awful, let's kick them out  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:37:55):**  and, you know, we'll start governing, and it will all be better. I think the sort of  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:00):**  historical lessons there that the people that start governing in their stead, you know,  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:05):**  not necessarily any better, you know, part of the problem is government itself, not the  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:09):**  particular flavor of the people who are in government. So, you know, I think there's,  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:14):**  I mean, I'm not saying that that means we shouldn't vote, you know, vote for better,  
**[0:38:18-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:18):**  better candidates rather than worse and engage in all of that political process. But ultimately,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:23):**  it's not really about, you know, who's pulling the strings in central government, you know,  
**[0:38:29-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:29):**  it's about a sort of deeper kind of economic and political transformation.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:33):**  And ultimately, if politicians were far sighted enough to see the sorts of changes that we're  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:40):**  expecting, and to understand the importance of land reform, then there's no reason why  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:45):**  we can't have a land use strategy where there aren't incentives for landowners and farmers  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:51):**  to actually set aside parts of their farms so that the general citizenry can use that  
**[0:38:57-0:39:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:38:57):**  and take advantage of that land. And there could be financial incentives from government  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:00):**  to farmers to allow that to happen.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:02):**  Yeah, I mean, you know, it would be great if there was a kind of real push for land  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:06):**  reform. I mean, I think, you know, England, you know, if we're just talking about the  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:10):**  UK, I think England is behind the game in turn, you know, relative to say Scotland or  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:15):**  Wales, you know, but yeah, it would be great to do that. And there are, you know, there  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:18):**  are sort of initiatives and the Land Workers Alliance are doing stuff about bringing small  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:24):**  scale horticulture into the mix on larger scale farms. So, you know, there's loads of  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:29):**  kind of good things that can be done on the ground. But ultimately, I think there are  
**[0:39:33-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:33):**  these obstacles of the larger economic system and, you know, the way that land is financialised.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:39):**  Chris, in terms of this conversation, the conversation we've just been having, the conversation  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:43):**  more broadly throughout this programme, and through the book, you're presenting people  
**[0:39:48-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:48):**  with a choice. We can choose a dystopia in which we pick through the debris of disaster,  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:39:54):**  or we can choose to reconstruct our political economy and pre-adapt to the ecological insecurity  
**[0:40:00-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:00):**  we're facing by creating a new and perhaps more egalitarian society, one that you suggest  
**[0:40:07-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:07):**  would be more resilient to ecological change.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:09):**  Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I think that frames it very well. You know, I'm not, I'm not sort  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:14):**  of presenting a future utopia saying, oh, you know, it'll all be lovely if we just have  
**[0:40:18-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:18):**  our, you know, our gardens and small holdings. But, you know, I think if we don't, if we  
**[0:40:24-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:24):**  don't confront some of these big crises and structural obstacles, it could be pretty bleak.  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:31):**  The key is to make the best of the reality that we confront. And I think that does mean  
**[0:40:36-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:36):**  more fairness, less inequality, it means more people living and working in reinvigorated  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:43):**  countrysides and it means, you know, all the things we were talking about earlier, it means  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:47):**  creating local food cultures of which, you know, of which we're all a part rather than,  
**[0:40:52-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:52):**  you know, just consumers sort of down at the store.  
**[0:40:55-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:40:55):**  Just finally, in your chapter from religion to science and back, you imagine a new agrarian  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:02):**  society developing, more in tune with the rhythm of the year, where there are seasons  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:07):**  of carnival and excess tempered with periods of Lenten restraint. Now, we still of course  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:12):**  have festivals in the countryside. And this mid-summer, I was at the Philly loo in Ash  
**[0:41:17-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:17):**  Moor in Dorset with drinking and games centred around the village Dew Pond, the highest bit  
**[0:41:22-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:22):**  of land in Dorset and the evening culminating at sundown with a haunting and sombre horn  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:29):**  dance. But these are just faint echoes of the past. Are you looking forward to a new  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:34):**  period of medieval excess?  
**[0:41:36-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:36):**  Yeah, well, it's an interesting question because I think, you know, we sort of tend to have  
**[0:41:41-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:41):**  this view of the past as being sort of incredibly grim and, you know, everyone knows to the  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:46):**  grindstone and, you know, there is an element of truth to that. But there was also all of  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:50):**  that, you know, the carnival excess. You know, one of the issues, as I said earlier, you  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:41:55):**  know, in modern times, we've got very focused on work and hard work, you know, the sort  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:01):**  of classic political slogan of hard working families and I think, you know, people in  
**[0:42:05-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:05):**  the past to some extent may have had a bit more wisdom than we do now on, you know, there  
**[0:42:12-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:12):**  being times for hard work and times for play, you know, so.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:16):**  I mean, the winter festival would last for weeks, wouldn't it?  
**[0:42:20-0:42:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:20):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I think we forget how, you know, how much the emphasis on financialisation  
**[0:42:27-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:27):**  and accumulation sort of, you know, keeps us chained to the office or the tractor or,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:32):**  you know, whatever it might be. So, you know, I don't want to, you know, you always get  
**[0:42:36-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:36):**  this sort of accusation that you're romanticising the past or wanting to go back to some image  
**[0:42:42-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:42):**  of a golden age. And I think, you know, we need to get beyond that, you know, we need  
**[0:42:46-0:42:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:46):**  to, you know, we're not trying to recreate anything from the past, but we can, if we  
**[0:42:50-0:42:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:50):**  sort of get over our own sort of modernist arrogance, we can learn from the past, you  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:42:54):**  know, and definitely sort of reevaluating work and play is something we need to do.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/A-small-farm-future-e1lgv7i#t=0:43:00):**  Chris, thanks so much. That's all we've got time for.

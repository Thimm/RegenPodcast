### Farm Gate  (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 16:58:52)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. Despite near universal support for laws to  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:11):**  restrict lower quality food imports into the UK, the government rejected amendments to  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:16):**  the agriculture bill that would have protected farmers and citizens. Instead, in a bid to  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:21):**  reassure the public on food standards, a trade and agriculture commission was established  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:26):**  by the Department of International Trade, the DIT. Well, this created an outcry, particularly  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:32):**  amongst NGOs, because the commission was short-term, non-statutory and its membership was largely  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:38):**  devoid of independent environmental or farm animal welfare expertise. Government reacted  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:44):**  again and the trade and agriculture commission has now been put on a statutory basis for  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:48):**  three years, but questions remain about its membership and potential effectiveness. Moreover,  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:55):**  there's concern that Britain is already on the back foot, that by default as we leave  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:00:59):**  the EU, our trade policy will be reactive rather than proactive and progressive. Tom  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:05):**  West is the UK environment lead at ClientEarth and Angela Francis is WWF, UK's chief advisor  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:12):**  on economics and economic development. I met them following an environmental roundtable  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:17):**  hosted by the commission and I started by asking Angela Francis what she thought the  
**[0:01:22-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:22):**  impact of future trade deals would be on agricultural land use reform in the UK.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:29):**  It's actually been really heartening to see in the one area that the UK can very obviously  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:35):**  go beyond the EU in reforming agricultural policy, it's taken the bit between its teeth,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:40):**  it's set out a public money for public goods framework for the agriculture bill. We also  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:45):**  have a coming environment bill which sets out a due diligence framework for eliminating  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:49):**  deforestation from the UK supply chains, but trade has got an enormously important part  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:54):**  to play in this too and standards are key to that. It's really interesting that the  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:01:59):**  government's decided not to support amendments or make its own changes to legislation because  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:05):**  there's almost universal support, as you say, across farmers groups and civil society groups,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:09):**  but then also the surveys that we have done and that which have done show 92 to 93% of  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:15):**  the public want to protect food and farming standards. I think there's a great quote from  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:20):**  George Freeman, a Conservative MP who's not known for being a particular rebel, he said  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:25):**  that DIT have moved their position on this and they were first saying that we didn't  
**[0:02:30-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:30):**  need to do anything more on standards because they were already in law. Then they said that  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:33):**  those standards bind our hands in negotiations, which implies they do want to change them.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:38):**  Then they said that the WTO won't let us keep the standards we've got, so they're also suggesting  
**[0:02:42-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:42):**  they're going to change. Then they've also said there's nothing wrong with the food that's  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:45):**  currently banned, so chlorinated chicken is safe to eat, so have some for dinner tonight,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:49):**  that sort of thing, which doesn't give you confidence. Then finally, we've had a statement  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:53):**  from the DIT that says that low standard food is the price we pay for a US trade deal and  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:02:59):**  then have tried to talk about other ways that they would deal with low standard food through  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:03):**  pricing or labelling and all of these other inadequate replacements for those food stuffs  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:08):**  being banned. So it is really confusing and I think it's confusing because DIT have been  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:13):**  confused. I think if we got Baze, Defra and DIT around the table to say what are we actually  
**[0:03:18-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:18):**  trying to achieve, we'd get a lot better position than we have at the moment where we're actually  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:21):**  going to have those conversations over a negotiating table with Australia, New Zealand and Canada  
**[0:03:26-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:26):**  before we've got our own story straight.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:29):**  So, just to help with the acronyms there for international listeners, we're talking about  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:33):**  the inconsistency between the Department for International Trade, Business Energy and Industrial  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:38):**  Strategy and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. That's Defra, Baze and  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:43):**  DIT. But despite the inconsistencies that exist, Tom, and despite the fact that we have  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:50):**  concerns about the way that the Trade and Agriculture Commission has been constituted,  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:56):**  what is it do you think, what is it that you hope the commission will achieve?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:03:59):**  Well, I think what the commission could do is it provides a forum where this conversation  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:04):**  around how the UK should be designing its approach to imports and its approach to trade  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:10):**  and agriculture can happen. These things are not straightforward. They are very complicated.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:14):**  They can't just be sort of worked out overnight and then done. And so creating a forum for  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:18):**  those conversations to take place, not just now but ongoing into the future, I mean, that's  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:22):**  certainly helpful. We've seen in the Ag bill that the amendments being proposed are being  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:26):**  rejected by the government. And I think what we need instead is we need something which  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:30):**  is going, not necessarily, but we need commitments in law, of course. But as well as these commitments,  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:35):**  we also need to find forums where the conversation can take place and move forward. But that  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:39):**  needs wider involvement of other people, that needs transparency, that needs long term mandates.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:44):**  And one of the things that we're told, one of the concerns that people within government  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:48):**  have had, and I can remember a conversation actually with George Eustace going back maybe  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:52):**  four years ago where he was saying this, that the WTO is some sort of a big bad wolf, that  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:04:57):**  it won't allow us to kind of, you know, impose standards on the rest of the world. And I've  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:02):**  never been comfortable with that analysis of where the WTO is. Is he right?  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:07):**  I don't think that's quite right. And client Earth brought out a report looking into this  
**[0:05:11-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:11):**  matter, looking into how import restrictions can be made compatible with existing international  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:15):**  trade rules. Now, the first thing to say is, look, there is need and scope for these overarching  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:21):**  WTO rules to be reformed. The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs first negotiated and  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:26):**  agreed back in the 1940s. It's outdated. It does contain exemptions which allow countries  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:32):**  to put in place measures for environmental reasons, but it can be improved in order to  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:36):**  be clear that that includes matters to protect the global commons, matters to combat climate  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:40):**  change. And we set out recommendations to this effect in our report, ways in which FTAs  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:46):**  can modernise. And some FTAs already do that to some extent, but there's space there.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:50):**  But the other really important issue, I think, is the question as to whether import restrictions  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:54):**  or what import restrictions are permissible under WTO rules. And what the research in  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:05:58):**  our report shows is that how the WTO panels look at this is they look at things on a case-by-case  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:04):**  basis. They look at each thing individually and say, what is the measure here aiming to  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:08):**  do? Is it aiming to meet a legitimate environmental objective? If it is, then that's a very good  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:14):**  start. It also, in cases dealing with asbestos, dealing with frozen chickens, there's some  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:19):**  famous cases around shrimp and tuna. And it says, what's the measure that's being attempted  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:25):**  to be achieved here? And are the measures being taken justifiable and proportionate  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:30):**  in relation to those? So if the UK wanted to, we say there are some  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:33):**  footholds there. There are some ways that the UK could say, hang on, what we're trying  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:37):**  to do here, it's not just domestic protectionism. We want to protect the environment. We want  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:41):**  to take important measures to meet our environmental commitments, our domestic ones, net zero,  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:46):**  environmental coming up, our global international commitments too, CBD COP coming up, Paris  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:51):**  agreement of course. And we need to put in place measures which will allow us to meet  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:06:54):**  those. And by doing that, and by being progressive and being bold politically at the WTO, there's  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:00):**  some space here to do things better. And you mentioned there, Tom, the fact that  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:05):**  the UK now has a seat at the WTO. Of course, that's as a result of our leaving the European  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:10):**  Union. The European Union had the seat at the table before that. So there is an opportunity  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:14):**  for us to use that seat to help to reform and improve the way that the WTO approaches  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:21):**  sustainability. But Angela, at the commission roundtable,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:25):**  you mentioned the way in which it's not just UK versus US. We tend to think about the UK  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:31):**  as having higher standards. We don't want to have chlorinated chicken. We don't want  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:34):**  hormone reared beef. But you mentioned US fisheries and the way that the WTO has approached  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:40):**  a bill out of the US. I think it was the Marine Mammals Protection Act and the way that they've  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:45):**  responded to that.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:46):**  That's right. We can look at bits of the US agriculture system and say they aren't particularly  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:51):**  progressive on climate or nature. But then in other bits of food production, seafood,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:07:57):**  the US has been a leader in thinking about how it wants to change seafood production  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:03):**  to protect marine mammals. So this Marine Mammal Protection Act is a piece of domestic  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:07):**  legislation which the US passed, but it's now starting to apply it to imports of seafood.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:13):**  So it requires countries that want to export seafood into the US to make provisions for  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:19):**  how they're going to protect marine mammals in their fisheries. And that requirement starts  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:23):**  raising the standards all over the world and really dealing with damaging issues for biodiversity  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:29):**  from bad fishing practices. And the US have done that in exactly the way that Tom just  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:33):**  described, in a way that's non-discriminatory, that sets out a legitimate environmental objective.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:38):**  It applies it equally to importers and to home producers. And that's the kind of things,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:43):**  the kind of model that the UK could be looking at for its agricultural policy. Because we  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:47):**  have a Climate Change Act, because we have a nature restoration framework in the 25-year  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:52):**  environment plan, and because we have public money for public goods, we can say very legitimately  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:08:58):**  that we are trying to move agriculture onto a sustainable footing to protect climate and  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:01):**  to protect nature. And we are going to require countries that want to export agricultural  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:06):**  commodities to the UK to do something to show that they are playing the same game. Because  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:11):**  we know that if we raise production standards for UK farmers, but don't do anything on imports,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:16):**  all that we do is just offshore our environmental impact somewhere else. And UK farmers are  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:21):**  in a fantastic position to be leading on this. It's something that I think not only have  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:25):**  we got the policy framework for, but we've got the expertise and the academic research  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:31):**  support that means that we can really deal with farming in a very different way and lead  
**[0:09:35-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:35):**  the way.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:36):**  So Tom, as our legal expert here from ClientEarth, just to be clear, this was the WTO explicitly  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:43):**  allowing a member state, in this case the USA, to restrict trade based on ethical and  
**[0:09:48-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:48):**  environmental policies at home.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:50):**  So the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which I'm just talking about, this is the US putting  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:09:55):**  in place a domestic process to make sure that it's important, meeting its requirements.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:00):**  But in many cases for the WTO, they have looked at measures that are put in place and the  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:06):**  WTO has in place through Article 20 of the GATT, these public policy exemptions, which  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:11):**  clearly give space to members to put in place measures which are designed to, amongst other  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:17):**  things, protect the environment. And as I said, those do need updating. It would be  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:21):**  better if those were clearer about what sorts of measures are allowable, under what circumstances,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:27):**  bringing those up to date to the 21st century.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:29):**  I mean, that's really what it's about. It's about saying, obviously our understanding  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:32):**  of what's needed from an environmental point of view has advanced enormously in the last,  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:37):**  what is it, 60, 70 years. So it's about bringing it up to date, while of course also working  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:41):**  within that existing framework to make that case, both politically and legally, that it  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:46):**  must be possible for states to take measures which are well designed and which are there  
**[0:10:50-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:50):**  to protect the environment and public health.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:52):**  I suspect that there's hardly a person who, you know, is vaguely aware of the news that  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:10:56):**  hasn't come across the idea of chlorinated chicken and hormone-reared beef. These are  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:01):**  the big sort of ticket things that the people are concerned about being brought into the  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:05):**  UK. What other sorts of things could get in under the radar, even if the government is  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:10):**  true to its commitment and doesn't let in chlorinated chicken?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:13):**  Yeah, there's lots of standards that are set out in things called statutory instruments,  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:17):**  which have appendices with thousands of lists of chemicals, residue levels, rules on antibiotics  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:24):**  in meat, rules on milk quality, which sit in tables that the UK has transferred over  
**[0:11:30-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:30):**  from EU law into UK law. And those food standards apply equally to food produced in the UK and  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:37):**  food that we import. So it's not just these iconic issues. It's a whole set of things  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:43):**  around our food standards. And at the moment, the way they sit in law is they can be changed  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:47):**  by a minister at the stroke of a pen with no requirement for any parliamentary discussion  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:53):**  about the change. And sitting behind all of these decisions is an approach that the UK  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:11:58):**  takes to how it wants to protect human health and how it wants to protect animal welfare,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:03):**  which we have inherited from the EU and applied for the last 30, 40 years, which is called  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:09):**  the precautionary principle. So the UK takes an approach that if something is being given  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:14):**  to humans to eat or used in animal welfare, it is up to the producer to produce to prove  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:19):**  that is a safe system, not for the consumer to ingest it for 20 years and then have to  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:24):**  fight a court case to prove that it's bad for you. And that approach is the one we're  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:28):**  used to. Other countries have different approaches, which means that they use chemicals that we  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:32):**  don't use and have systems that we don't we don't have in the UK. If you change your trade  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:38):**  rules and accept what is sometimes called, I think wrongly, a science based approach  
**[0:12:44-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:44):**  to regulatory standards, it's not about each standard changing, it's about changing your  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:48):**  whole principle to law. And so even though you might not want to allow in chlorinated  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:53):**  chicken or hormone beef, if you start accepting the principle that you have to prove something's  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:12:57):**  bad before you can ban it, as opposed to prove it safe before you allow people to eat it,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:02):**  then suddenly you'll find yourself not being able to stop those products coming into the  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:06):**  country.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:07):**  Well, there's a huge amount of complexity that you're referring to there, you know,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:10):**  within these statutory instruments and and so on. And again, it reminds me of, of, you  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:15):**  know, the the incredible learning curve that the UK has to be on. And we talk about, you  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:21):**  know, trade deals often taking 10, 15, even more years to be developed. And we're trying  
**[0:13:26-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:26):**  to do this at an absolute sprint.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:28):**  What I'm really concerned about is that we sign trade agreements, which they might not  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:33):**  themselves change the rules directly, that would be quite unusual for a trade agreement  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:37):**  to do. But what they do is they create mechanisms and processes which allow the changing of  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:42):**  these rules through undemocratic and untransparent ways. So putting in place relatively harmless  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:47):**  sounding mechanisms, things like regulatory cooperation, we like cooperation, don't think  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:51):**  we should do that, or ways to assess equivalence. But if in practice, those are done behind  
**[0:13:55-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:13:55):**  closed doors reliant largely on trade experts or civil servants or trade lawyers not involving  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:02):**  wider stakeholders, both from business, but but also, of course, hugely importantly, from  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:07):**  civil society, to make sure that the public's interests are being represented. That may  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:11):**  put in place changes which where things can be made without the right transparency without  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:15):**  the right scrutiny. And then we end up in a situation where things are being changed  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:19):**  without really equals proper consent. And I think for me, that really ties in to some  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:24):**  to wider problems that we're seeing, which which goes back to some of the issues we're  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:28):**  talking about earlier, which is that the government's quite happy to talk the talk and a lot of  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:32):**  this talk is good and positive. But when it comes to walking to the war, when it comes  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:35):**  to really putting that stuff down in law, it's falling short. Now, as lawyers, you know,  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:40):**  of course, we always think it's sensible to have things in law. That's not just because  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:44):**  we like the law. That's because by putting things down in a legal framework, you get  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:49):**  certainty, you get clarity, and you get accountability so that everyone knows the rules of playing  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:54):**  to and if someone whoever that might be thinks that they're not being lived up to, there  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:14:57):**  are routes in place for people to challenge that. So all of that stuff is really, really  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:01):**  important. At the moment, we're just not we're just not seeing those.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:04):**  I think, you know, if you sort of take this from a different perspective, and you think  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:07):**  about it from the government's point of view, then it's easy to understand why they don't  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:12):**  want to have their hands tied behind their back when they're approaching these, these  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:15):**  new free trade deals, because there is going to be a certain amount of haggling that takes  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:19):**  place presumably, you know, behind these closed doors, where we don't quite know what's going  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:24):**  on. Is it helpful in that circumstance where you are haggling over something, albeit over  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:30):**  a number of months or even years to have red lines that you can go in there from the outset  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:36):**  and say, this is our red line, this isn't going to shift, this is set in UK law, or  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:41):**  is it better to have that flexibility? Our view, I think, and it's been played out  
**[0:15:45-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:45):**  by the way the US negativators work and the European negotiators work is it's much better  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:49):**  to go with your red lines. So the US take their trade negotiating mandates through Congress,  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:54):**  and then when they're sitting at the table and being pushed on an issue they don't want  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:15:57):**  to be pushed on, they can say, I can't go any further, this is the mandate I have from  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:01):**  Congress. Similarly, the EU take their negotiating rules through, through Parliament, that has  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:07):**  led them in deals with the US when they're discussing them and they haven't got a deal  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:11):**  with the US yet, it's been been impossible to get it. They have gone into that deal saying,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:14):**  we aren't even having an agriculture chapter, we're not discussing agriculture with you.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:19):**  There are so many problems with us trying to cooperate around regulation for agriculture,  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:24):**  our approach is so fundamentally different to ours, that we think it's easier just not  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:28):**  to discuss it. And so the negotiations that happened when they happened didn't even discuss  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:33):**  agriculture. So the two biggest trading nations go in, if you want to call it with their hands  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:37):**  bound, they go in with their hands bound, and that actually helps them not talk about  
**[0:16:41-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:41):**  the things they don't want to talk about. And I think about this not as much about who's  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:45):**  got power, but it's about having clarity and coherence about what are you trying to achieve  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:50):**  in these in these negotiations. And for us, it should be about trying to marry our economic  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:16:56):**  objectives and our and our environmental objectives, we're trying to work out how we develop the  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:01):**  industries we need to develop that are going to survive and succeed in you know, the next  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:05):**  50 years, help us meet our net zero commitments help us meet our nature restoration commitments.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:10):**  And I would like somebody to tell me how they think a trade deal that undermines our standards  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:16):**  is in any way useful first step to that. All of those things are true. And then the other  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:21):**  thing I think we need to remember is a US trade deal is marginal in terms of its economic  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:26):**  benefits. So the government's own analysis has said that a trade deal with the US the  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:31):**  most liberal, the most kind of concession, the most kind of deep trade agreement you  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:35):**  could get would be worth naught point one 6% to GDP by 2035. So it would take 15 years  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:43):**  to add less than half a percent to GDP. So that's an enormous risk to take for such a  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:49):**  marginal benefit. And I think it's much more important for us to think about not the number  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:54):**  of deals we try and do and the UK is putting itself under enormous pressure to do deals  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:17:58):**  with the US, Australia, New Zealand, all at the same time, rather than thinking about  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:03):**  how many we do, we need to think about assessing these deals on the contribution they make  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:07):**  to a green recovery and contribution they make to the industry we're trying to build  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:11):**  because I do believe that trade can help us innovate and it can help us compete, but only  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:15):**  if we do it in a way that's consistent with what we're trying to achieve in those industries,  
**[0:18:19-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:19):**  not over a negotiating table with what your opposite party wants to achieve.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:22):**  Okay, so let's let's move on to that. We've looked at this from quite a sort of defensive  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:27):**  starting point. We've looked at standards, we've looked at law, we've looked at where  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:31):**  we perhaps distrust the government to deliver particular things. We look at it from a sort  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:35):**  of an alternate viewpoint. What do we think government policy should be in terms of approaching  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:41):**  these trade deals? How should we be approaching them as we go forward in order to make sure  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:47):**  that our own values, our own standards are met, but also that we're beginning to export  
**[0:18:52-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:52):**  those elsewhere around the world?  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:55):**  Well, I think a really important starting point that the UK needs to have in its trade  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:18:59):**  policy, its trade negotiations, is being clear that it will not, it'll put its environmental  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:04):**  and climate commitments first, that those are the starting points, that that's what  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:08):**  the UK side up to. And that's putting them first politically, but also when necessary,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:13):**  putting them first legally, so that if there's any conflict between rules, people might need  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:18):**  to have or agree to on trade, they'll say, but yeah, but actually, it's not just environment,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:22):**  of course, there's other hugely important matters on human rights, humanitarian issues,  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:25):**  which would also fit in that sort of wider public interest category of issues which should  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:29):**  come first, so that when there's any conflict, we would know where we'd stand. It's also,  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:33):**  I think, a matter of who we want to do business with. And this comes back really to what Andrew's  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:37):**  talking about in terms of getting our positions and our red lines clear and upfront and saying  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:42):**  that that's who we want to be as a country, that's the sort of future we see for ourselves,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:47):**  who's with us. And if you're pointing in roughly the same direction, thinking the same sorts  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:52):**  of things, then let's have this, you know, productive conversation about how we do, you  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:19:56):**  know, to develop better technology, to tackle climate change, to farm in more sustainable  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:01):**  ways, whatever it might be. And that's a much more productive conversation than one which  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:05):**  is simply trying to, as you say, be defensive against the sort of erosion of our current  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:10):**  standards. Yeah, we're very disappointed, I suppose, to be having a conversation where  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:15):**  we're constantly having to talk about not going backwards, when we actually could be  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:19):**  having a conversation about how the UK goes forwards. We think the UK's agricultural policy  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:24):**  has been some of the most revolutionary and leading we've seen anywhere in the world.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:28):**  And we absolutely need to have some countries starting to do that. So food and farming system  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:34):**  is responsible for 30% of the world's emissions. It's responsible for 70% of terrestrial  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:39):**  biodiversity loss and 50% of freshwater biodiversity loss. Now that is an industry that  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:44):**  needs big changes. And the industry itself knows that. So as well as those being kind of the  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:49):**  external factors, the industry itself is experiencing degraded land, which is costing it  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:20:54):**  up to 10% of global GDP. Pollinator loss, so the loss of bees and other pollinators, is impacting  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:01):**  production and crop levels losses about five to 8% a year that these things are affecting the  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:06):**  industry and is already starting to move. And it wants to be able to go further in saying,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:11):**  how do we farm differently and you know much more about the agro-ecological methods that are being  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:16):**  being looked at than I do. But the industry also knows it is impossible to invest and innovate  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:22):**  in how you do things differently if you're constantly being undercut by countries that  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:26):**  haven't got there yet. So I firmly believe that this is the direction agriculture is going to go,  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:30):**  but it's probably going in a kind of a slightly lumpy way where some countries will get it before  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:35):**  others. And if at the same time as you start to say, let's improve our standards of production  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:40):**  and invite farmers to try and work out how they can produce food in ways that don't damage nature  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:45):**  and can actually contribute to greater carbon sinks from our landscapes, if you invite them  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:50):**  to do that at the same time as saying, oh, by the way, you're going to have to compete with  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:54):**  these guys who aren't doing it at all, you're not doing anything. And these 10 years are so  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:21:58):**  important. And we just don't have time to be talking about the problems of going backwards  
**[0:22:02-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:02):**  when we should be going forwards. We're talking about a joined up government approach, really,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:06):**  aren't we? And as you say, we've been making substantial progress through the agriculture bill  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:11):**  and potentially through the environmental land management scheme in terms of actually getting  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:15):**  monies to farmers to deliver those public goods. But then also on the other side, we need this  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:20):**  trade policy to be set in a way that supports farmers and producers as they are transitioning.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:27):**  I wonder if there are other things if we're thinking about joined up government policy,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:30):**  you mentioned labelling, I think earlier, Angela, what else is there that government  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:35):**  should be looking at between trade policy on one hand and agriculture policy at government  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:41):**  level on the other? What are the things in between that the government could and should be doing?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:45):**  So I think what we've got, I suppose, is an industrial policy that's started in the farming  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:49):**  space. We don't often think about industrial policy for farming, but it's really important  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:22:53):**  that you design things. So the example I gave at the roundtable was the example of sow stalls.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:00):**  When the UK decided to ban sow stalls, you know, quite rightly, it didn't do anything to say about  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:05):**  what type of meat it would import. So it still imported those meats. And what happened was we  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:08):**  just ended up importing a lot more pork from other bits of Europe, which still had these systems.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:14):**  And if we're trying to think about these kind of 21st century challenges, we need to start thinking  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:18):**  about import standards as one part of it. But then what other things have we got in the mix? And  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:22):**  I would say labelling and maybe tariffs come in, rather than stopping the stuff at the bottom,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:27):**  they start coming in in ways that you can encourage the best stuff. So in labelling,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:32):**  which government seems to always talk about as an alternative to standards, and we can talk about  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:37):**  all the reasons we think that doesn't work. But one of the reasons is so little of our food is  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:42):**  actually labelled. We eat 60% of our food in restaurants and cafes and out and about and we  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:47):**  don't have labels and it's already processed, so you can't see what's in it. So that is probably  
**[0:23:52-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:52):**  something that's not going to change most food. But if you had labelling systems or reduced tariffs  
**[0:23:58-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:23:58):**  for the very, very best quality food, you were giving an extra incentive to the few customers  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:03):**  who cared, you start to create routes and increased preference for those foods. I think that's a good  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:08):**  place for it to sit. It just doesn't sit at the bottom and replace something like a standard.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:12):**  What we're looking at here is the need for an array, an arsenal of different tools,  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:16):**  which we needed for different purposes. The idea that there's the panacea, the one size fits all.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:20):**  There's never one, is there? It doesn't matter where you're looking, it never exists.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:23):**  So in particular, in this space, I think it's important to, as Angela says, get that distinction  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:27):**  between what's the really bad stuff that we need to stop and what's the good stuff we need to  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:32):**  encourage, and also how that may differ between domestic production standards and what we require  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:38):**  of our domestic producers versus what we require of our imports, bearing in mind the different  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:42):**  ecological, political, socioeconomic circumstances that exist around the world, but making sure  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:48):**  those are connected. So again, that's back to your point, Pinna, about making sure things are  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:51):**  connected so that if we see changes in one area, that that makes sense and speaks to changes  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:24:56):**  elsewhere. Sort of related, but also just wanted to talk about the possibility of making improvements  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:02):**  in public procurement as well, and where there may be knock-on effects and value there. And again,  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:06):**  this comes back to joined up thinking across governments and walking the walk as well,  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:11):**  and that could potentially have a value impact too. It's an excellent point, because I think  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:15):**  there's possibilities to go higher in public procurement. UK government doesn't have particularly  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:21):**  high environmental standards yet for its catering and food budgets, but one of the places we're also  
**[0:25:26-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:26):**  concerned that you can drop further down is in school or hospital or prison budgets, where  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:34):**  finance is important and budgets are often squeezed, that when, if a food stuff ends up  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:39):**  coming into the UK, labelled or not labelled, there'll be extreme pressure for some of those  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:43):**  volume buyers to end up buying foods which have these lower standard things in it, and then you  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:48):**  don't get a choice, because if your relative is in hospital, that's what they're going to be eating.  
**[0:25:52-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:52):**  If your child is having their school dinner, that's what they're going to be eating, and you  
**[0:25:55-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:55):**  don't get a choice over it. So I think that's where, you know, labelling fits in alongside  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:25:58):**  lots of other things, and standards are actually incredibly important for enabling people not to  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:03):**  worry. The interesting evidence that the Witch found is that everybody cares about food standards  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:09):**  and nobody wants food standards to go down. We talked about that at the top, but when they did  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:13):**  a socio-economic breakdown, the poorer you are, the more likely you are to care about standards,  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:17):**  and I think that's kind of connected to the fact that you know that you're more likely to be at  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:22):**  risk, because at the moment you don't have to worry. UK's food standards are pretty good,  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:26):**  and hopefully they improve in quality and in environmental impact. Everybody cares about  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:31):**  these things, but not everybody's got the time or the budget to choose something very special,  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:36):**  but knowing that there's actually a really, really good flaw and you can't go below that,  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:41):**  makes a lot of people feel a lot more comfortable about the food they're putting on their plates.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:45):**  We're coming to an end, and I just want to ask this sort of last question really as an  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:49):**  opportunity to wrap up your views on, I guess, you know, a lot of what we've talked about today.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:26:55):**  Can we become global leaders? What I would say is, the question is, can we be environmentally  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:00):**  bold? And the answer to that question is definitely yes. The UK definitely can, if it wants,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:05):**  stand up and say we're going to do these things differently, we're going to meet our environmental  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:10):**  and our SDG commitments. Now, part of doing that is, I think, taking a bit of a step back and  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:14):**  saying, well, what's trade for? Why do we want to increase trade, or why do we want to do trade  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:18):**  deals? What's the point of it? And sure, the point of it has got to be, well, to make people's lives  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:22):**  better. It's got to be about making people's lives better, whether that's here in the UK or  
**[0:27:26-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:26):**  elsewhere too, and then say, well, how do we do that? And clearly doing that in a way which is  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:30):**  just and which meets our environmental commitments, that's got to be not just a part of it, but that's  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:35):**  got to be central to it. At the moment, sometimes it feels like we're doing trade deals because  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:39):**  we're doing trade deals because that's the thing we need to be doing. But say, well, why? What's  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:43):**  the value? What should we be getting out of those and how that would then inform our approach to  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:47):**  them? I totally agree with that. I mean, the reason that so many environmental groups, I think,  
**[0:27:51-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:51):**  have got so exercised by the approach to trade is because the UK is actually in an amazing place to  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:27:58):**  lead on food and farming. We have Europe does lots of things very well, but it hasn't done farming  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:04):**  particularly better than anybody else. The CAP system wasn't great. The one thing we've done  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:08):**  is come out and change that into something that's a framework for farming that's going to support  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:14):**  agricultural, sustainable agricultural production. That is an enormous potential win for the UK and  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:20):**  for the world. And so to have that undermined by our trade policy, which isn't looking at how it  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:25):**  reinforces that commitment to change our production and our consumption is just a wasted  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:30):**  opportunity for us and for the rest of the world. And I think in a COP year, when the UK has got the  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:35):**  eyes of the world on it after Brexit, and having had the Climate Change Act, for us not to say that  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:40):**  we're putting environments and how we change our economy to deliver on our environmental goals,  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:46):**  how we don't put that at the centre of our trade policy, I think will knock everybody's confidence,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:51):**  to be honest. And I think we need to step up, be much more confident, much more ambitious.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:28:56):**  It is possible and we can do it. Even from this point, I still believe we can do it.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Is-a-progressive-UK-trade-policy-possible-en7ant#t=0:29:00):**  World Finance and so I will. That's all we have time for. I'd like to thank my guests Tom West,

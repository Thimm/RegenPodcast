**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, thanks for listening to this podcast. But just before you start, I want to apologise  for some of the sound quality. We're not sure what's happened, but the conferencing  equipment didn't work as well as usual, and although we've cleaned up the recording  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:18):**  as much as possible, there are still times when the quality falls well below our usual  standards. That said, the conversation about human behaviour change is really interesting,  so I do hope you'll be able to bear with us, and thanks once again for listening to  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:35):**  and supporting the Farm Gate podcast.  Welcome to Farm Gate, I'm Finn low, today I'm asking the question why are facts not  enough? And in this context, we'll be looking at the psychology of human behaviour change.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:52):**  Well, I'm joined for the conversation by three human beings. Ruth Layton is a vet,  she's the co-founder of FAI Farms, which has tackled food system change for about two  decades, and she's also the founder of San Calpa, a philanthropic direct social investment  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:08):**  organisation. I'm also joined by Joe White and Suzanne Rogers from Human Behaviour Change  for Animals. Well, we'll be looking at the challenges of communicating new ideas and  information in the modern world and at the psychology of change, but perhaps just to  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:25):**  start with, you could introduce yourselves and tell me why it is that you're interested  in this topic. Perhaps Ruth, we could start with you.  The reason I'm interested in this topic is like you say, I was a co-founder of a business  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:38):**  that's been looking at food and food systems for 20 years, and it, God knows why it took  me so long, but in the last few years, I suddenly realised that although I knew a lot about  food systems and animal welfare in particular, the change was not being made. And I had a  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:58):**  bit of a light bulb in that I knew a lot about animals and systems, but very little about  people and what people were and how they changed. So I educated myself a little bit by doing  an MSc in transpersonal psychology, which was hugely helpful. And then that sort of  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:14):**  gave me a window into another world. And I came across Jo and Sue's doing this work and  then it seemed to fall into place. And so we're working together on various projects  now and I hope we'll do a lot more in the future because as we're saying, facts alone  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:31):**  are not enough. It's obvious they're not enough.  So Jo, human behaviour change, is it a social science? Is it psychology? What is it and  what's your involvement?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:40):**  With human behaviour change, why it's so exciting is the breadth and depth of the subject. It  allows us to pull on the social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, anthropology,  but also we can delve and look at things like technology and design. We can pull on areas  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:58):**  like behavioural economics, areas from social media and social marketing, for example. It  gives us a real breadth and depth of knowledge, both from a scientific point of view and evidence-based  perspective, but also from a practical point of view. Things can be applied that actually  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:13):**  work in reality. So we can get a real understanding of why people do certain behaviours or don't  do others and how we can work and support people to change.  And Sue's, human behaviour change for animals has been around, I think, for the last five  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:27):**  or six years. Could you just tell us what that is and how that's come about?  Human behaviour change for animals, our organisation, we set it up in 2016 after we both joined  Jo and I together, we were working as independent animal welfare consultants, organised the  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:43):**  first international conference on human behaviour change for animal welfare. And as a result  of that conference, there was a lot of energy in the room. There was a real thirst for developing  this further. And so we decided to do that by creating a community interest company,  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:58):**  which we called Human Behaviour Change for Animals, so that we could really forward the  thinking in this area. We do consultancy work, we create resources, we're creating a community  of people interested, a community of people who believe that by understanding why humans  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:15):**  do the things they do and what drives them to change, we can make the world a better  place for animals.  That's interesting, isn't it? Because I mean, I've been coming at this sort of work from  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:24):**  an environmental perspective, looking at climate change and the way that facts aren't always  enough to change people's attitudes and behaviours. And you've all been looking at it from a range  of perspectives, but in particular, in terms of how people change their attitudes to animals,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:42):**  change the systems that they're using to rear animals, in particularly, from Ruth's perspective,  for food. And Ruth, I know that this has become a really big concern for you in the last couple  of years, and that you've been keen to do a podcast looking at this, that sometimes,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:58):**  even when people have facts staring them in the face, there are all kinds of other things  that get in the way that stop people from accepting that information, and indeed from  changing their behaviour to demonstrate the necessity of what that information has called  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:17):**  for.  Correct. And, you know, my big my big moment was, I got work 20 years ago with one of the  major, the major retailer of the time. And I thought, you know, I thought that was it.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:30):**  I thought I'd arrived. I thought I will just give this company and all their suppliers,  all my, the benefit of all my worldly wisdom and everything will change. And it didn't.  It is not that there was no change, but the change was very, very slow. So it's become  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:46):**  increasingly obvious to me over the years. And then of course we try things. I think  we tried things like coercion, demanding, you know, you can't supply us unless you do  this, that works to a degree. But the thing that works the best is obvious, isn't it?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:01):**  It works. Things only really work when people really want to do them. If people don't really  want to do them, then they seem to revert back to the old ways. And I guess I'm looking  at Joe and Suze to give us insight into that, because that's, that's my experience of humanity.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:16):**  And, and, I mean, I'm, while you're talking about that, I'm, I'm actually seeing gangster  movies in my head as well, that, that people will change their behavior if they wake up  with a horse's head on their pillow as they did in Godfather. And, and so there are these  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:30):**  kinds of polls, these opposite polls. There's the the kind of the nurturing approach where  you try and bring people along with you. And then there's the kind of the big stick. And  I, and I suppose, you know, away from a gangster movie the big stick is, is legislation. And  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:44):**  then there's, there's kind of everything in between. And just before we go over to, to  Suze and Joe to talk a little bit about the psychology and the science behind human behavior  change, do you think over the last 20 years or so that this has changed, Ruth? Do you  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:59):**  think that things have become more difficult or easier? Are there, has, has society moved  in that period?  Yes, I would say definitely. The young people I'm working with now, it's very interesting  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:11):**  is that they get very frustrated about the rate of change. But I would say the rate of  change is increasing all the time because I think we evolve as human beings and maybe  the surround, things like Extinction Rebellion make no, no doubt about it, have raised profile,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:28):**  Greta Thunberg, these people raise profile and it allows us, I've always said this in  the animal welfare world, you know, you get very frustrated about something and then an  organized organization like Compassion, you know, they come over the hill like a cavalry  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:43):**  because they raise it big time, then people start to listen and then we can do our work.  So the rate of change in my experience is increasing, but it's way, way too slow.  So the, so the question is, how can we understand human behavior change, but then really how  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:59):**  can we accelerate it so that we can deliver that change within the timeframes that we  ourselves as a species have made necessary, but which nature is now placing on us in terms  of demands. Sus and Jo, I wonder if you could, you know, we've, I've, I've used the phrase  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:17):**  human behavior change many times already in the podcast. I wonder if somebody could just  explain what we mean by that.  In relation to understanding why people do certain behaviors. So in the first instance,  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:32):**  how we look at behavior change is that initial understanding and gaining an insight into  why people are doing certain behaviors and all the factors that relate to it. So in relation  to their attitudes, things that would be encouraging them to do that behavior, their particular  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:47):**  beliefs, things that feed into that. So there are so many different elements such as social  influence, how they've learned the behavior in the first place, whether they have social  support, there are many, many different factors that we would take into account in, in looking  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:04):**  to understand the behaviors that surround the particular issue or the particular area  that we're interested in, in maybe looking at change. So that's the kind of first element  from a point of view of behavior change is that understanding. We would then look at  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:19):**  it from the perspective of how we can work with the person, how we can support them in  developing and looking at change. So that's looking more from an intervention perspective.  In one of the things that evidence has shown us is that if we can work with people and  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:36):**  they can own that change, just as Ruth has already highlighted, if people own their own  change, they are more likely to continue with it. And this is another element of human behavior  change is how we move from that understanding of why someone does something to actually  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:51):**  supporting them through the process of change.  And when we're talking about human behavior change, is there an element or an understanding?  Whose behavior is it that we're trying to change? Is there a political element to this?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:04):**  I think that everyone's trying to change other people's behaviors, whether it's at home through  trying to change our husband or our children, or in our work trying to change consumers.  And we think about change as working across all these levels. In some of our clients,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:19):**  for example, vets, we work with them and their communication with their clients, and how  to drive change and compliance and improve the lives of animals in that one to one setting.  But also the science of human behavior change can very much be applied at the consumer level,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:35):**  at the community level, and at a wider kind of mass change level. And there's different  interventions and different ways of doing that. And of course, some of the interventions  will differ depending on your audience. And so some policy changes might affect mass behavior  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:50):**  change. And then there's some other different interventions for more individual change.  And I know, Suze, we had a conversation in advance of the podcast offline. And there  was, you know, there was there was some concern, if you make people aware that you're trying  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:04):**  to change their behavior, then then obviously, that's, that's a problem. And, and it's easy  to be accused of being, you know, slightly Machiavellian about this, is there a Machiavellian  element to it? Or is it simply about people just trying to understand people better?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:19):**  I think the latter and a big part of the whole science is about understanding behavior. And  when people feel understood, and as if they have a voice, and then you can have a more  appropriate dialogue. And really, behavior change is all about that dialogue, whether  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:34):**  it's dialogue of one to one or a dialogue within or between communities. That's what  we're aiming for. It's about improving communication, improving dialogue, helping everyone to feel  valued, worthwhile, their input matters, their opinion is valid. And if we can understand  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:52):**  that we will be working at the causes and not the symptoms of some of the issues we  face.  And so going back to the the analogy I was using earlier, where, you know, we're not  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:00):**  remotely looking, are we at the sort of gangster end of the spectrum of trying to sort of force  people into change, it's much more that kind of nurturing end where, you know, you're sort  of using positive reinforcement to get, you know, better behavior from your children trying  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:14):**  to make sure they look both ways before crossing the road, etc. So it's kind of it's around  that. That's that sort of side of things.  Well, the science of behavior works across all things, if we really understand why the  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:27):**  horse's head, the bloody horses head works, that's part of it. And that's part of understanding  behavior change, and understanding when a really deep impactful negative action drives  change is as important as deciding when it won't or how negative it has to be. And so  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:44):**  the science of behavior change covers the whole spectrum. Of course, the way that we  tend to focus most of our efforts is in the more positive arena, because there's lots  of science that shows that the positive communication, that dialogue or the things we've been talking  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:00):**  about that is more effective than using shock tactics.  So help me out. So I'm trying to think of some examples here. And, and before Christmas,  we we had a an encounter between our car and under river in the floods. And so we've had  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:16):**  to go out and buy a new car. Now, I know, in my mind that I should be going out and  trying to find an electric car. And yet my economics, the budget that I have available  means that we ended up with yet another fossil fuel car because it was it was a sixth of  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:32):**  the price even on the secondhand market. And so there are all kinds of other things that  kind of get in the way on there. It's I want to change my behavior. I want to do the right  thing. But economics and other sort of social aspects layer on top of that and stop and  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:48):**  I wonder, you know, how we balance these things out.  It's about understanding the barriers and truly identifying and understanding the barriers.  And as people trying to change behavior, it's so important that we address the right area,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:01):**  the actual barrier, a barrier that we assume might be the case. And I think that's really  important in our work. Lots of campaigns, lots of work to change people are based on  assumptions and often erroneous assumptions. They assume that people are doing things for  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:15):**  one reason or another. And if that's wrong, you base your whole intervention on the wrong  on addressing the wrong barrier. So a big part of what we do is really taking a step  back to see where the behavior is coming from to understand it. And by understanding it,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:29):**  we can then know how to change it. And so yes, what you mentioned with the car example  is we would really want to explore those barriers, see what's important to you, try to work out  how to make some of the barriers less and put them in perspective. And that's the approach  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:44):**  we'd use to understand the barriers, understand those influences, and then see how we can  affect them.  And so presumably when you're looking at those barriers, I mean, some of those were, were  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:54):**  inside my control, I suppose, and some of them were outside of my control. And so when  you're looking at human behavior change, and you're talking about barriers, are you then  helping people to look at strategies that they can put in place to change everything  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:09):**  from, I don't know, the frames that they use to look at the world, the, the language that  they use to think of things, right up to, you know, kind of legislative change or the  change of whether you feel that you're going to get the approval of your peers or that  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:27):**  sort of thing.  Yeah, we look at it across the spectrum. So as you've highlighted, we, depends on the  organization and the particular challenge that someone or an organization is dealing  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:38):**  with. But yes, we would look at a variety of different approaches, but I think one of  the things we often talk to, to people about and clients is about breaking it down and  making it as simple as possible. So the more you can unpack the issue or the problem that  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:54):**  you're facing and actually start to break it down into simple behaviors, the more likely  we are to actually be able to develop a successful strategy. So it's, it's things like, I think  the simple, simple example that comes up time and time again is about things like physical  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:08):**  exercise and people may want to get fitter, lose weight, just generally be healthier in  their, in their life. But to tackle all of that at once is a really big challenge. So  if you break it down and then think actually the first step would be, I need to go for  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:23):**  a run. So actually thinking about how I can set myself up to succeed. Well, the simplest  thing is I can start by providing myself with a cue to go for that run by putting my trainers  next to my bed. So it's about kind of looking at how big complex problems can be broken  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:40):**  down into smaller and smaller steps that are actually really easily achievable for us.  Because I think if we try to tackle one big, massive problem, it's very difficult and very  challenging and more likely to fail. Whereas if we can take small steps, we can achieve  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:57):**  successes and actually that can be built upon in terms of actually having a really positive  result.  It's interesting that you use the example of going out for a run. And I suppose, you  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:07):**  know, a lot of people in the springtime after Christmas will, will kind of be aware of that  urge to get a little bit fitter. And I'm wondering how we, how we kind of move past the idea  of novelty. And I, you know, I was watching one or two of the films that you've, you've  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:19):**  got of your presentations online, which are really interesting. And, and one of them where,  you know, I kind of see that novelty thing. If you've, if I'm, you know, if you're trying  to get a four year old boy as, as I am to, to wee in the right place and I'll actually  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:35):**  get it into the toilet, then you have this sort of fly in the urinal example where instead  of just telling the child to do the thing that you want them to do and repeatedly getting  it wrong and the child repeatedly getting wrong, you make it into a challenge. And there  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:48):**  was another one with a staircase and an escalator and the staircase became a piano. And I think  the comment that you were making was, you know, everybody had moved from the escalator  to to the piano, but there was a question as, as to whether the novelty for that would  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:04):**  wear off. And in the same way, if somebody chooses to go for a run, you know, the first  couple of times you do it, it's, it's, it's interesting enough, but then it gets a bit  dull. And what, what can motivate you to, to keep on doing that, to continue with that  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:19):**  change?  There are a number of things you can put in place. And I think in environmental change  is really interesting. So from a perspective of looking at how you can design your environment  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:30):**  or design the environment to make it more, there be more chance that you're going to  succeed in change. And I think in animal welfare, there's been plenty of examples such as the  great work that people at Temple Grandin have done to look at how you can design those situations  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:46):**  where humans and animals are interacting to make it easier for both parties. So thinking  about some of the work done in slaughterhouses and in markets. And the same is true, you  know, when you actually think about kind of how we designed our road networks, we've set  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:04):**  them up. So the environment makes it easier for that flow of traffic. And I think this  is, this is areas that we can really pull upon about how we set ourselves up to succeed.  But there's also things that we can do in a kind of more everyday context. So it's linking  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:20):**  some of our everyday habitual behaviors, because 40 to 45% of our daily behaviors are habitual.  You have to think about making that cup of tea, cleaning your teeth, driving to work.  And if we can link some of the behaviors we want to do to those habitual behaviors, we're  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:37):**  more likely to succeed. So, you know, we often talk about when we're discussing with the  veterinary profession about how they can increase compliance, say, for example, with clients  giving medication to their animals, and we say, well, perhaps if the person regularly  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:52):**  makes a cup of tea in the morning, they could actually look at how they link that behavior  of making the cup of tea, something they're going to do every day and automatically to  giving the animal their medication. So there are many things that we can link into existing  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:06):**  behaviors to make it easier for us to do it. But you also touch on reward. And I think  there is an opportunity there. And for example, research undertaken in Germany, where they  used a chocolate as a means to provide that kind of motivation and endorphin rush when  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:23):**  the person went for the run, which over a period of time, as they were going for the  run, and they were doing the activity, they found that they no longer needed it because  they were getting feedback from from doing the run in its own right. So I think over  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:37):**  a period of time, we also have to take into account the behavior itself may provide that  positive, brief feedback, but we need to set it up to actually work and succeed. So Ruth,  when you were talking earlier on about the work that you've been doing with retailers  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:52):**  and food businesses over the course of the last 20 years, and that sort of sense 20 years  ago, you know, we got our first client, we've made it where we're going to change the world  and and change was slower, but you you've obviously kept at it and been very successful  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:08):**  in that area. And I wonder if there were particular things that you're able to highlight particular  techniques that you've used, you know, whether that's persuasive techniques or data techniques,  which have helped to deliver change at a faster rate than you were managing initially?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:23):**  It's a good question, Finn Lowe. And I you know, this is why I'm so interested in Joe  and Sue's work and similar work, because I don't think we did evolve our techniques,  particularly I think what happened over a period of time is the umbrella around us got  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:38):**  stronger in the sense of people generally care more about where their food comes from  and all these issues and therefore the people that we were working with also add more. So  I think it happened around us, the science around food production and animal welfare  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:53):**  etc has increased over the years as an animal welfare person and a food person. I think  the recognition is that our information is not enough and we need to bring in other skill  sets. As a loan, we don't have it.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:07):**  And I wonder about the role of outcome measures and actually collecting data because it seems  that one of the things that FAI has always been at the forefront of is this idea of collecting  information so that it's easier to compare what you're doing if if you're trying to make  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:22):**  change and you're trying to deliver change on farm, for example, in a vacuum, then that  that potentially comes quite difficult. You can make assumptions about whether you're  making progress or not, but actually being able to, you know, it's going back to that  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:35):**  fitness thing. If you can see yourself getting fitter, you can feel happier in yourself in  the same way if you can actually see those outcome measures improving. Does that have  an impact?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:46):**  You raise a really important point here. So what I would say we've done over the years,  those of us that have looked at these techniques, we've improved them in the sense that we've  simplified them. So outcome measures for me, you know, it's so simple and you think, well,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:00):**  why weren't we doing this 20 years ago? The truth is we weren't so focused. I don't know  why, but anyway, things evolve and outcome measures have a huge place in the sense that  they simplify what needs to be done. So instead of having literally hundreds of thousands  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:15):**  of input measures, you have a few outcome measures that then you can apply in every  situation across the world. So, you know, my mantra is lame cow is a lame cow wherever  she is in the world and we don't want lame cows. So that measure is a very simple measure  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:30):**  that we can apply and the solutions are many and varied, but it still comes down to the  same thing. Although we've simplified what needs doing, it still doesn't get done if  people, there's still a behaviour change needed to really take it on board. And some of that  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:46):**  now is coming through pressure, but I think this other angle that people like Jo and Suze  bring is so important. I just, you know, my personal story is it's very easy for me to  have kept on the animal welfare programme for all these years. I was born with it almost.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:01):**  That's why I became a vet and then I've done what I've done. It's something in me that  drives me to do that. What would be interesting was I had a seminal moment with someone that  stayed with me on the farm and I always used to ask people after they'd spent a period  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:15):**  of time, you know, have you seen anything on the farm that bothers you and things that,  you know, that you want to, that you think we should be doing better? I was meaning in  terms of animal welfare and this one very mature student looked at me and she said to  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:27):**  me, yes, there's something that really bothers me, Ruth. And I thought, oh my gosh, I said,  what is it? She said, the fact that you don't recycle. And from that day on, I knew I should  be recycling. It was a long time ago now, but I didn't recycle. It's something that  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:39):**  I came fairly because it wasn't top of my personal agenda.  So it's about how to, how to lift those things up agenda so that, so that there are  sort of multiple, multiple outcomes, multiple public goods, if you like, that people are  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:53):**  focusing on and delivering at once. Joe, you've given us quite a, an extensive sort of background  around the science of, of human behaviour change. But I wonder, Suze, when we're talking  about it, are there shortcuts that we can, we can help listeners with? Are there sort  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:10):**  of categories of the types of change that we're talking about here?  Definitely. So some things, as we touched on earlier, could be a change through policy.  So policy change can be a shortcut that might involve legislation as a tool. We were recently  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:26):**  reminded of this when Joe had a trip to Kenya for a research project. And even before she  went she was told that plastic bags are no longer allowed in Kenya. Kenya has just banned  plastic bags. We were really surprised to see how this worked in, in the real life,  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:42):**  because we know that often things aren't enforced and on the ground it's quite different to  what the situation is meant to be. But Joe reported back and lots of other reports show  that there has been a massive difference in if plastic bags aren't available and then  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:55):**  they can't be used. So sometimes legislation can and policy change can provide that shortcut.  I think there's also shortcuts when we're interacting with people directly or interacting  with communities directly. And this is where some of the interesting psychology comes in.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:08):**  So for example, just by knowing that if we push an agenda too strongly, if we go in too  strongly with our views about why people should change, if we as animal welfareists really  underline that we think that animals have intrinsic rights to a life worth living, for  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:26):**  example, and if that isn't shared by the other person, we're likely to create what's called  reactants or they're going to push back against that because the more that the stronger we  come in with an opinion, we open up the likelihood that they will form the counter opinion in  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:41):**  their head. And the more people are given the opportunity to rehearse that opinion,  it's going to cement their viewpoint. And so that's a really interesting, easy win almost,  because if we are careful about the way that we frame our own agenda and that we frame  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:55):**  our own what we want to happen in a way that isn't going to trigger this reactants and  the other person, we're going to have a much more chance of a much better chance of creating  really constructive dialogue. So that's almost a shortcut in the way we interact with people  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:12):**  in the same way that we know that there's various cognitive biases that people work  through. So we all see the world through a lens. We all bring to the party what our experiences  and as Jo introduced earlier, from our early life, from our parenting, from our education,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:26):**  from the people we interact with and our social support networks. And we know that when we  are much more likely as humans to take on information, if it fits with what we already  believe in, then we are if some information comes in that counters that. And so again,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:41):**  by being careful about the way we frame things, we can try to frame it in a way that won't  trigger that response in other people, that won't trigger their likelihood to shut down  what we're saying. So that's another kind of a shortcut in terms of dialogue.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:53):**  And that feels like it sort of opens us into a range of other sort of elements. So we can  sort of break down that kind of how do we deal with reactants? And I'm thinking about  climate change and climate change denial. And if we look at Britain over the course  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:07):**  of the last 20 or 30 years, and maybe climate change in the Conservative Party, then, you  know, we got Mrs. Thatcher in the 80s being the first politician to say that climate change  is a clear and present danger and that something needs to be done, but then something happens.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:23):**  And I wonder if it's this kind of, you know, climate change is taken on by the environmental  community, it's then seen as being something that the left piggybacks to promote its own  agenda of interventionalism, legislation, you know, big state. And so there's a reaction  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:40):**  by by the more sort of right wing or conservative facets of society that some and again, something's  changed over the last few years, because now the Conservative Party just as the Labour  Party and you know, this around the world that people are starting to sort of recognise  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:57):**  that climate change is a clear and present danger. And so I wonder how that how we've  got past that reactants, whether it's been about the framing of the language that people  have been using, we're not talking about polar bears so much now we're talking about agricultural  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:12):**  land and financial risk.  There has been some work undertaken in the conservation sector, looking at how the use  of positive framing can support and encourage people through through empowering them to  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:27):**  feel that they can actually take action. They looked at some of the previous messaging that  had gone on, which was sort of more negatively focused and found that actually people felt  quite disempowered and that they weren't able to take action. So I think that's potentially  
**[0:29:42-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:42):**  one factor. But it's also the situation where how you align these things to be more connected  to people's values, the things that they really care about, and actually making it very relevant  to their day to day lives. So I think there's been quite a bit of work to to bring it home  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:02):**  to people how relevant this is to their the way they live, how it's connected to everything  they're doing and how it's going to impact on them as individuals. And I think that message  is getting through in a stronger, more impactful way. And as Ruth highlighted earlier in when  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:18):**  we were talking about the role that young people are taking on in terms of this, they're  taking on the responsibility of pushing it forward. And I think that in itself is shaking  the system up and making people reflect because our younger people are doing some of the things  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:35):**  that that maybe we should be shouting about as well. So I think there's a kind of a number  of different factors involved in why that's kind of getting more traction and being highlighted  more evidently.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:46):**  While you were saying that I was sort of thinking a little bit around as well the way in which  climate change has been presented, it continues to be presented as a big threat to society.  But there, but actually some of the language that's coming out of government now, and more  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:02):**  out of business, is that it's also an opportunity. It's an opportunity to, it's an opportunity  for new industries and businesses to grow, you know, for example, within the renewables  sector. It's an opportunity, even if we don't care about the climate issue itself, to clean  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:18):**  up the air because air pollution is a problem. So I think it's partly what you were touching  on there around values. It's sort of finding different ways of presenting information so  that people who have taken a position are able, and physically and mentally able, to  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:33):**  change that position. That instead of it being a problem that you deal with by going backwards,  you can be progressive, you can move forwards into the future to solve climate change.  Very much so. It's that giving people the opportunity that there is, you know, that  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:47):**  they can take action and that they can actually do something positive and constructive that  will make improvements. And I think that's a really important point you're making there  about actually how it's almost being, as you say, it's being seen as an opportunity and  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:03):**  businesses now engaging as a result of that.  Now, I wonder about the way that the environment has changed, even just in the last five or  ten years, that social media has just boomed. It's very easy nowadays to just sit and exist  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:17):**  within your own bubble. And it's quite difficult to move out of that bubble. And I'm wondering,  you know, if we were in the 1970s or the 1980s, whether somehow it would have been easier  to talk to people, to have, you know, an intelligent conversation with people. Do you think that  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:33):**  social media has damaged this sort of change that we're talking about? Has it made it harder?  I think it's probably made it different. So I think there's always challenges and advantages  and disadvantages with the technology that's available at any one time. So social media,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:49):**  yes, we it works by putting people in bubbles, the echo chamber effect, where the more you  look at a certain type of position or the more you look at certain resources, you're  more likely to get one that is similar. And so you're in a danger of being quite narrow  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:05):**  in what you're exposed to. But again, at the other side, of course, it's an amazing tool  for reaching vast amounts of people, forgetting information quickly around the world. And  so there's a huge advantages to it as well. I think what we need to work on as a society  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:20):**  is really nurturing the ability of the critical thinking for the just teaching people that  we are all in those bubbles. And I know that in some countries in Scandinavia, they are  really focusing on this actually in schools, they're teaching critical thinking, they're  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:36):**  making people aware that when you only listen to the same people in the same sources, you're  in danger of missing so much else out there. And I think it's important for us all to realize  that I really try to make an effort to go out of my way to seek out different sources  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:53):**  of information that I wouldn't normally go to, and to be aware of what's out there to  try to avoid that bubble effect. So I think that it's a challenge for modern day society.  And there's answers out there, but it's going to be a rocky road, there's going to be some  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:07):**  good things, some real challenges. And we'll see how it all works out.  There is a there is a real sense that social media has provided has brought light to dark  places. I mean, Iran is a great example of where suddenly there is information and transparency  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:25):**  coming out of a country that was traditionally quite hard to get information from. But it's  it's kind of balancing that out, it seems with that tendency for people to listen to  people that they agree with, because it's easier, it's less challenging. And somehow  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:41):**  it's, it's encouraging more people to get outside of that bubble and, and talk to people,  I guess, not even just on social media, but talking to people in the town or village or  city that you live in, that you meet and finding out more about what they think as well.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:55):**  Exactly. So understanding human behavior change and the science of human behavior change isn't  optional anymore, it's going to become a necessity, because to succeed in getting your message  out to the people that you want to hear it, it's going to require an understanding of  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:09):**  behavior change. And without that the efficiency of your message is really going to be compromised.  So, so let's, we're running out of time. So let's, let's move on to practical steps. Are  there, you know, if people are listening, and they're thinking, okay, so some of what's  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:24):**  being talked about here is really ringing, ringing true with me, there are things that  I would like to do better. There are messages that I need to communicate that somehow I'm  not managing to communicate as effectively as I as I want to. Can you give any sort of  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:39):**  practical tips, things that people should think about in order to improve their own  communication skills?  I think it's, Susie's just been highlighting, it's, it's, first of all, as much as anything,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:52):**  it's understanding, the more you can understand. So that is about having conversations with  people who you may be, who are some who you are working with, but also people who are  maybe of a different viewpoint from you. So you can really understand kind of what the  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:08):**  resistance is, if there is resistance to change, the more you can understand that, and also  understand who is out there and who you're trying to communicate, the better. And I think  that's kind of one of the first key steps. We've talked about positive framing, and I  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:21):**  think looking at the language that you're using when you're having these conversations,  and that might be through verbal communication or written communication, but thinking about  that kind of language that's being used, and if it can be positively framed to, to demonstrate  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:37):**  what's in it for the person you're trying to communicate with, why should they be interested?  Why should they take action? We've talked about values and actually looking at values  based communications. What is it that the person you're communicating with, what do  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:51):**  they care about? What's going to resonate with them? Are there areas where you can align  your values from a point of view? Are there things that you share so you can have that  common ground? And when we're talking about verbal communications, one of the most important  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:05):**  elements is actually the importance of listening. So both from a point of view of understanding,  but making sure that the person that you're communicating with really feels that they're  being, they have been listened to and they're being heard and that their issues and concerns  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:20):**  are being taken into account. So those are a few things from a, from a communication  point of view. And I think it's, it's making sure that the clarity of message is getting  through and that the message itself is being tested. So it's asking for feedback. It's  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:34):**  not always something that we as humans like to have, but the more we can actually ask  for feedback and take what people are saying, whether it's positive or critical and reflect  upon that because the reflections can really help us to develop on the way we communicate.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:50):**  Just sort of, you know, thinking about listening there, I wonder Ruth, if there are things  that you've heard during the course of the conversation or that you know about human  behaviour change that, that help you to draw any conclusions you know, why are facts not  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:05):**  enough? How can we get better at portraying the information that we have?  Yes, I guess I've, you know, I've already drawn some conclusions, which is why I was  keen to have this conversation, but you know, you listen to the conversation and it just  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:20):**  deepens those conclusions. And to me, it comes down to, you know, in all of our interactions  with each other, if we can stay in this place of care and respect for each other, that doesn't  mean agreement. And I think that's sometimes where these things go awry. They think, some  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:36):**  people seem to think if you, if you listen to people, it's an automatic, you're going  to agree. It's not about that. It's really about listening to each other with respect  and with integrity. And then we can find common ground, I think naturally arises from that  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:51):**  because when we understand each other better, we can look for that common ground and then  we can move forward. Otherwise, and I, you know, I totally get, I think Joe or Susan  were talking this thing about if we, if we are too heavy with people. And that's one  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:06):**  of the things if I had my time over again, you know, I was too hard on people, harder  myself.  I guess our passion at human behaviour change for animals is that the science is out there.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:17):**  The science about how to understand humans, what drives them to behaviours they do, and  also what drives them to change. The science is out there. We need to apply it. We need  to get creative and excited about harnessing the powerful information that the science  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:33):**  gives us, the evidence gives us. And through doing that, we can create a sustainable difference  and therefore sustainable change through collaborating together in a positive evidence-based way.  And that this will, we really believe that this will therefore create positive change  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:48):**  for animals, for humans, for human animal and the planet as a whole.  Fantastic. And I think, you know, a conclusion that I might draw is that, you know, humans  have been changing, have been evolving for, you know, for thousands of years, but there's  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:03):**  something now, there's a certain level of crisis now, whether that's down to the way  that nature is reacting to human endeavour or the size of our populations or the diets  that we have, whatever it is, there is a need to accelerate that change. And it seems that  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:20):**  the human behaviour change, you know, the psychology around that and the things that  we've been talking about are about giving us the mechanisms to understand each other  better, to have more respect for each other, and to ensure that, you know, as a species,  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:35):**  we can not just change human behaviour, but change it fast enough that we still have a  human species and indeed other species, you know, in the next hundred or two hundred years.  Well, thank you very much, everybody. That's been a really interesting conversation. I'd

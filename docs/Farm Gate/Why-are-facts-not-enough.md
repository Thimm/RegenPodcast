### Farm Gate  (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 09:37:39)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, thanks for listening to this podcast. But just before you start, I want to apologise  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:10):**  for some of the sound quality. We're not sure what's happened, but the conferencing  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:14):**  equipment didn't work as well as usual, and although we've cleaned up the recording  
**[0:00:18-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:18):**  as much as possible, there are still times when the quality falls well below our usual  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:24):**  standards. That said, the conversation about human behaviour change is really interesting,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:30):**  so I do hope you'll be able to bear with us, and thanks once again for listening to  
**[0:00:35-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:35):**  and supporting the Farm Gate podcast.  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:42):**  Welcome to Farm Gate, I'm Finn low, today I'm asking the question why are facts not  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:47):**  enough? And in this context, we'll be looking at the psychology of human behaviour change.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:52):**  Well, I'm joined for the conversation by three human beings. Ruth Layton is a vet,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:00:58):**  she's the co-founder of FAI Farms, which has tackled food system change for about two  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:03):**  decades, and she's also the founder of San Calpa, a philanthropic direct social investment  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:08):**  organisation. I'm also joined by Joe White and Suzanne Rogers from Human Behaviour Change  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:14):**  for Animals. Well, we'll be looking at the challenges of communicating new ideas and  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:20):**  information in the modern world and at the psychology of change, but perhaps just to  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:25):**  start with, you could introduce yourselves and tell me why it is that you're interested  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:30):**  in this topic. Perhaps Ruth, we could start with you.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:34):**  The reason I'm interested in this topic is like you say, I was a co-founder of a business  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:38):**  that's been looking at food and food systems for 20 years, and it, God knows why it took  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:44):**  me so long, but in the last few years, I suddenly realised that although I knew a lot about  
**[0:01:50-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:50):**  food systems and animal welfare in particular, the change was not being made. And I had a  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:01:58):**  bit of a light bulb in that I knew a lot about animals and systems, but very little about  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:03):**  people and what people were and how they changed. So I educated myself a little bit by doing  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:10):**  an MSc in transpersonal psychology, which was hugely helpful. And then that sort of  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:14):**  gave me a window into another world. And I came across Jo and Sue's doing this work and  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:21):**  then it seemed to fall into place. And so we're working together on various projects  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:26):**  now and I hope we'll do a lot more in the future because as we're saying, facts alone  
**[0:02:31-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:31):**  are not enough. It's obvious they're not enough.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:34):**  So Jo, human behaviour change, is it a social science? Is it psychology? What is it and  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:39):**  what's your involvement?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:40):**  With human behaviour change, why it's so exciting is the breadth and depth of the subject. It  
**[0:02:46-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:46):**  allows us to pull on the social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, anthropology,  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:53):**  but also we can delve and look at things like technology and design. We can pull on areas  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:02:58):**  like behavioural economics, areas from social media and social marketing, for example. It  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:03):**  gives us a real breadth and depth of knowledge, both from a scientific point of view and evidence-based  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:08):**  perspective, but also from a practical point of view. Things can be applied that actually  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:13):**  work in reality. So we can get a real understanding of why people do certain behaviours or don't  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:18):**  do others and how we can work and support people to change.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:22):**  And Sue's, human behaviour change for animals has been around, I think, for the last five  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:27):**  or six years. Could you just tell us what that is and how that's come about?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:31):**  Human behaviour change for animals, our organisation, we set it up in 2016 after we both joined  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:38):**  Jo and I together, we were working as independent animal welfare consultants, organised the  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:43):**  first international conference on human behaviour change for animal welfare. And as a result  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:48):**  of that conference, there was a lot of energy in the room. There was a real thirst for developing  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:52):**  this further. And so we decided to do that by creating a community interest company,  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:03:58):**  which we called Human Behaviour Change for Animals, so that we could really forward the  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:02):**  thinking in this area. We do consultancy work, we create resources, we're creating a community  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:09):**  of people interested, a community of people who believe that by understanding why humans  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:15):**  do the things they do and what drives them to change, we can make the world a better  
**[0:04:19-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:19):**  place for animals.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:20):**  That's interesting, isn't it? Because I mean, I've been coming at this sort of work from  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:24):**  an environmental perspective, looking at climate change and the way that facts aren't always  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:30):**  enough to change people's attitudes and behaviours. And you've all been looking at it from a range  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:35):**  of perspectives, but in particular, in terms of how people change their attitudes to animals,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:42):**  change the systems that they're using to rear animals, in particularly, from Ruth's perspective,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:47):**  for food. And Ruth, I know that this has become a really big concern for you in the last couple  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:53):**  of years, and that you've been keen to do a podcast looking at this, that sometimes,  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:04:58):**  even when people have facts staring them in the face, there are all kinds of other things  
**[0:05:04-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:04):**  that get in the way that stop people from accepting that information, and indeed from  
**[0:05:10-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:10):**  changing their behaviour to demonstrate the necessity of what that information has called  
**[0:05:17-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:17):**  for.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:18):**  Correct. And, you know, my big my big moment was, I got work 20 years ago with one of the  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:24):**  major, the major retailer of the time. And I thought, you know, I thought that was it.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:30):**  I thought I'd arrived. I thought I will just give this company and all their suppliers,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:35):**  all my, the benefit of all my worldly wisdom and everything will change. And it didn't.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:41):**  It is not that there was no change, but the change was very, very slow. So it's become  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:46):**  increasingly obvious to me over the years. And then of course we try things. I think  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:51):**  we tried things like coercion, demanding, you know, you can't supply us unless you do  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:05:56):**  this, that works to a degree. But the thing that works the best is obvious, isn't it?  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:01):**  It works. Things only really work when people really want to do them. If people don't really  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:06):**  want to do them, then they seem to revert back to the old ways. And I guess I'm looking  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:11):**  at Joe and Suze to give us insight into that, because that's, that's my experience of humanity.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:16):**  And, and, I mean, I'm, while you're talking about that, I'm, I'm actually seeing gangster  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:21):**  movies in my head as well, that, that people will change their behavior if they wake up  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:25):**  with a horse's head on their pillow as they did in Godfather. And, and so there are these  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:30):**  kinds of polls, these opposite polls. There's the the kind of the nurturing approach where  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:35):**  you try and bring people along with you. And then there's the kind of the big stick. And  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:38):**  I, and I suppose, you know, away from a gangster movie the big stick is, is legislation. And  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:44):**  then there's, there's kind of everything in between. And just before we go over to, to  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:50):**  Suze and Joe to talk a little bit about the psychology and the science behind human behavior  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:54):**  change, do you think over the last 20 years or so that this has changed, Ruth? Do you  
**[0:06:59-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:06:59):**  think that things have become more difficult or easier? Are there, has, has society moved  
**[0:07:06-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:06):**  in that period?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:07):**  Yes, I would say definitely. The young people I'm working with now, it's very interesting  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:11):**  is that they get very frustrated about the rate of change. But I would say the rate of  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:17):**  change is increasing all the time because I think we evolve as human beings and maybe  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:22):**  the surround, things like Extinction Rebellion make no, no doubt about it, have raised profile,  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:28):**  Greta Thunberg, these people raise profile and it allows us, I've always said this in  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:33):**  the animal welfare world, you know, you get very frustrated about something and then an  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:38):**  organized organization like Compassion, you know, they come over the hill like a cavalry  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:43):**  because they raise it big time, then people start to listen and then we can do our work.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:47):**  So the rate of change in my experience is increasing, but it's way, way too slow.  
**[0:07:53-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:53):**  So the, so the question is, how can we understand human behavior change, but then really how  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:07:59):**  can we accelerate it so that we can deliver that change within the timeframes that we  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:05):**  ourselves as a species have made necessary, but which nature is now placing on us in terms  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:11):**  of demands. Sus and Jo, I wonder if you could, you know, we've, I've, I've used the phrase  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:17):**  human behavior change many times already in the podcast. I wonder if somebody could just  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:21):**  explain what we mean by that.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:24):**  In relation to understanding why people do certain behaviors. So in the first instance,  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:32):**  how we look at behavior change is that initial understanding and gaining an insight into  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:37):**  why people are doing certain behaviors and all the factors that relate to it. So in relation  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:42):**  to their attitudes, things that would be encouraging them to do that behavior, their particular  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:47):**  beliefs, things that feed into that. So there are so many different elements such as social  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:52):**  influence, how they've learned the behavior in the first place, whether they have social  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:08:58):**  support, there are many, many different factors that we would take into account in, in looking  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:04):**  to understand the behaviors that surround the particular issue or the particular area  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:09):**  that we're interested in, in maybe looking at change. So that's the kind of first element  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:14):**  from a point of view of behavior change is that understanding. We would then look at  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:19):**  it from the perspective of how we can work with the person, how we can support them in  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:25):**  developing and looking at change. So that's looking more from an intervention perspective.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:31):**  In one of the things that evidence has shown us is that if we can work with people and  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:36):**  they can own that change, just as Ruth has already highlighted, if people own their own  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:41):**  change, they are more likely to continue with it. And this is another element of human behavior  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:46):**  change is how we move from that understanding of why someone does something to actually  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:51):**  supporting them through the process of change.  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:09:53):**  And when we're talking about human behavior change, is there an element or an understanding?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:00):**  Whose behavior is it that we're trying to change? Is there a political element to this?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:04):**  I think that everyone's trying to change other people's behaviors, whether it's at home through  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:09):**  trying to change our husband or our children, or in our work trying to change consumers.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:14):**  And we think about change as working across all these levels. In some of our clients,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:19):**  for example, vets, we work with them and their communication with their clients, and how  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:24):**  to drive change and compliance and improve the lives of animals in that one to one setting.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:30):**  But also the science of human behavior change can very much be applied at the consumer level,  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:35):**  at the community level, and at a wider kind of mass change level. And there's different  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:39):**  interventions and different ways of doing that. And of course, some of the interventions  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:43):**  will differ depending on your audience. And so some policy changes might affect mass behavior  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:50):**  change. And then there's some other different interventions for more individual change.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:54):**  And I know, Suze, we had a conversation in advance of the podcast offline. And there  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:10:59):**  was, you know, there was there was some concern, if you make people aware that you're trying  
**[0:11:04-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:04):**  to change their behavior, then then obviously, that's, that's a problem. And, and it's easy  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:10):**  to be accused of being, you know, slightly Machiavellian about this, is there a Machiavellian  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:15):**  element to it? Or is it simply about people just trying to understand people better?  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:19):**  I think the latter and a big part of the whole science is about understanding behavior. And  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:25):**  when people feel understood, and as if they have a voice, and then you can have a more  
**[0:11:31-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:31):**  appropriate dialogue. And really, behavior change is all about that dialogue, whether  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:34):**  it's dialogue of one to one or a dialogue within or between communities. That's what  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:39):**  we're aiming for. It's about improving communication, improving dialogue, helping everyone to feel  
**[0:11:45-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:45):**  valued, worthwhile, their input matters, their opinion is valid. And if we can understand  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:52):**  that we will be working at the causes and not the symptoms of some of the issues we  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:56):**  face.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:11:57):**  And so going back to the the analogy I was using earlier, where, you know, we're not  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:00):**  remotely looking, are we at the sort of gangster end of the spectrum of trying to sort of force  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:05):**  people into change, it's much more that kind of nurturing end where, you know, you're sort  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:09):**  of using positive reinforcement to get, you know, better behavior from your children trying  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:14):**  to make sure they look both ways before crossing the road, etc. So it's kind of it's around  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:19):**  that. That's that sort of side of things.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:22):**  Well, the science of behavior works across all things, if we really understand why the  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:27):**  horse's head, the bloody horses head works, that's part of it. And that's part of understanding  
**[0:12:32-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:32):**  behavior change, and understanding when a really deep impactful negative action drives  
**[0:12:38-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:38):**  change is as important as deciding when it won't or how negative it has to be. And so  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:44):**  the science of behavior change covers the whole spectrum. Of course, the way that we  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:49):**  tend to focus most of our efforts is in the more positive arena, because there's lots  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:12:54):**  of science that shows that the positive communication, that dialogue or the things we've been talking  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:00):**  about that is more effective than using shock tactics.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:04):**  So help me out. So I'm trying to think of some examples here. And, and before Christmas,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:10):**  we we had a an encounter between our car and under river in the floods. And so we've had  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:16):**  to go out and buy a new car. Now, I know, in my mind that I should be going out and  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:21):**  trying to find an electric car. And yet my economics, the budget that I have available  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:27):**  means that we ended up with yet another fossil fuel car because it was it was a sixth of  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:32):**  the price even on the secondhand market. And so there are all kinds of other things that  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:36):**  kind of get in the way on there. It's I want to change my behavior. I want to do the right  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:42):**  thing. But economics and other sort of social aspects layer on top of that and stop and  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:48):**  I wonder, you know, how we balance these things out.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:51):**  It's about understanding the barriers and truly identifying and understanding the barriers.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:13:57):**  And as people trying to change behavior, it's so important that we address the right area,  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:01):**  the actual barrier, a barrier that we assume might be the case. And I think that's really  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:05):**  important in our work. Lots of campaigns, lots of work to change people are based on  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:10):**  assumptions and often erroneous assumptions. They assume that people are doing things for  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:15):**  one reason or another. And if that's wrong, you base your whole intervention on the wrong  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:20):**  on addressing the wrong barrier. So a big part of what we do is really taking a step  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:25):**  back to see where the behavior is coming from to understand it. And by understanding it,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:29):**  we can then know how to change it. And so yes, what you mentioned with the car example  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:34):**  is we would really want to explore those barriers, see what's important to you, try to work out  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:39):**  how to make some of the barriers less and put them in perspective. And that's the approach  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:44):**  we'd use to understand the barriers, understand those influences, and then see how we can  
**[0:14:49-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:49):**  affect them.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:50):**  And so presumably when you're looking at those barriers, I mean, some of those were, were  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:54):**  inside my control, I suppose, and some of them were outside of my control. And so when  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:14:59):**  you're looking at human behavior change, and you're talking about barriers, are you then  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:04):**  helping people to look at strategies that they can put in place to change everything  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:09):**  from, I don't know, the frames that they use to look at the world, the, the language that  
**[0:15:14-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:14):**  they use to think of things, right up to, you know, kind of legislative change or the  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:21):**  change of whether you feel that you're going to get the approval of your peers or that  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:27):**  sort of thing.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:28):**  Yeah, we look at it across the spectrum. So as you've highlighted, we, depends on the  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:34):**  organization and the particular challenge that someone or an organization is dealing  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:38):**  with. But yes, we would look at a variety of different approaches, but I think one of  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:43):**  the things we often talk to, to people about and clients is about breaking it down and  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:49):**  making it as simple as possible. So the more you can unpack the issue or the problem that  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:54):**  you're facing and actually start to break it down into simple behaviors, the more likely  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:15:59):**  we are to actually be able to develop a successful strategy. So it's, it's things like, I think  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:05):**  the simple, simple example that comes up time and time again is about things like physical  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:08):**  exercise and people may want to get fitter, lose weight, just generally be healthier in  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:13):**  their, in their life. But to tackle all of that at once is a really big challenge. So  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:18):**  if you break it down and then think actually the first step would be, I need to go for  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:23):**  a run. So actually thinking about how I can set myself up to succeed. Well, the simplest  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:29):**  thing is I can start by providing myself with a cue to go for that run by putting my trainers  
**[0:16:33-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:33):**  next to my bed. So it's about kind of looking at how big complex problems can be broken  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:40):**  down into smaller and smaller steps that are actually really easily achievable for us.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:46):**  Because I think if we try to tackle one big, massive problem, it's very difficult and very  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:51):**  challenging and more likely to fail. Whereas if we can take small steps, we can achieve  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:16:57):**  successes and actually that can be built upon in terms of actually having a really positive  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:02):**  result.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:03):**  It's interesting that you use the example of going out for a run. And I suppose, you  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:07):**  know, a lot of people in the springtime after Christmas will, will kind of be aware of that  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:11):**  urge to get a little bit fitter. And I'm wondering how we, how we kind of move past the idea  
**[0:17:16-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:16):**  of novelty. And I, you know, I was watching one or two of the films that you've, you've  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:19):**  got of your presentations online, which are really interesting. And, and one of them where,  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:25):**  you know, I kind of see that novelty thing. If you've, if I'm, you know, if you're trying  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:29):**  to get a four year old boy as, as I am to, to wee in the right place and I'll actually  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:35):**  get it into the toilet, then you have this sort of fly in the urinal example where instead  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:40):**  of just telling the child to do the thing that you want them to do and repeatedly getting  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:45):**  it wrong and the child repeatedly getting wrong, you make it into a challenge. And there  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:48):**  was another one with a staircase and an escalator and the staircase became a piano. And I think  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:55):**  the comment that you were making was, you know, everybody had moved from the escalator  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:17:59):**  to to the piano, but there was a question as, as to whether the novelty for that would  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:04):**  wear off. And in the same way, if somebody chooses to go for a run, you know, the first  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:09):**  couple of times you do it, it's, it's, it's interesting enough, but then it gets a bit  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:13):**  dull. And what, what can motivate you to, to keep on doing that, to continue with that  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:19):**  change?  
**[0:18:20-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:20):**  There are a number of things you can put in place. And I think in environmental change  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:24):**  is really interesting. So from a perspective of looking at how you can design your environment  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:30):**  or design the environment to make it more, there be more chance that you're going to  
**[0:18:34-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:34):**  succeed in change. And I think in animal welfare, there's been plenty of examples such as the  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:39):**  great work that people at Temple Grandin have done to look at how you can design those situations  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:46):**  where humans and animals are interacting to make it easier for both parties. So thinking  
**[0:18:51-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:51):**  about some of the work done in slaughterhouses and in markets. And the same is true, you  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:18:58):**  know, when you actually think about kind of how we designed our road networks, we've set  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:04):**  them up. So the environment makes it easier for that flow of traffic. And I think this  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:09):**  is, this is areas that we can really pull upon about how we set ourselves up to succeed.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:14):**  But there's also things that we can do in a kind of more everyday context. So it's linking  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:20):**  some of our everyday habitual behaviors, because 40 to 45% of our daily behaviors are habitual.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:27):**  You have to think about making that cup of tea, cleaning your teeth, driving to work.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:31):**  And if we can link some of the behaviors we want to do to those habitual behaviors, we're  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:37):**  more likely to succeed. So, you know, we often talk about when we're discussing with the  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:42):**  veterinary profession about how they can increase compliance, say, for example, with clients  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:48):**  giving medication to their animals, and we say, well, perhaps if the person regularly  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:52):**  makes a cup of tea in the morning, they could actually look at how they link that behavior  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:19:57):**  of making the cup of tea, something they're going to do every day and automatically to  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:01):**  giving the animal their medication. So there are many things that we can link into existing  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:06):**  behaviors to make it easier for us to do it. But you also touch on reward. And I think  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:11):**  there is an opportunity there. And for example, research undertaken in Germany, where they  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:17):**  used a chocolate as a means to provide that kind of motivation and endorphin rush when  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:23):**  the person went for the run, which over a period of time, as they were going for the  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:28):**  run, and they were doing the activity, they found that they no longer needed it because  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:32):**  they were getting feedback from from doing the run in its own right. So I think over  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:37):**  a period of time, we also have to take into account the behavior itself may provide that  
**[0:20:41-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:41):**  positive, brief feedback, but we need to set it up to actually work and succeed. So Ruth,  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:47):**  when you were talking earlier on about the work that you've been doing with retailers  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:52):**  and food businesses over the course of the last 20 years, and that sort of sense 20 years  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:20:57):**  ago, you know, we got our first client, we've made it where we're going to change the world  
**[0:21:01-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:01):**  and and change was slower, but you you've obviously kept at it and been very successful  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:08):**  in that area. And I wonder if there were particular things that you're able to highlight particular  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:13):**  techniques that you've used, you know, whether that's persuasive techniques or data techniques,  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:18):**  which have helped to deliver change at a faster rate than you were managing initially?  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:23):**  It's a good question, Finn Lowe. And I you know, this is why I'm so interested in Joe  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:28):**  and Sue's work and similar work, because I don't think we did evolve our techniques,  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:33):**  particularly I think what happened over a period of time is the umbrella around us got  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:38):**  stronger in the sense of people generally care more about where their food comes from  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:44):**  and all these issues and therefore the people that we were working with also add more. So  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:49):**  I think it happened around us, the science around food production and animal welfare  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:53):**  etc has increased over the years as an animal welfare person and a food person. I think  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:21:59):**  the recognition is that our information is not enough and we need to bring in other skill  
**[0:22:05-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:05):**  sets. As a loan, we don't have it.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:07):**  And I wonder about the role of outcome measures and actually collecting data because it seems  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:12):**  that one of the things that FAI has always been at the forefront of is this idea of collecting  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:17):**  information so that it's easier to compare what you're doing if if you're trying to make  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:22):**  change and you're trying to deliver change on farm, for example, in a vacuum, then that  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:28):**  that potentially comes quite difficult. You can make assumptions about whether you're  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:31):**  making progress or not, but actually being able to, you know, it's going back to that  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:35):**  fitness thing. If you can see yourself getting fitter, you can feel happier in yourself in  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:41):**  the same way if you can actually see those outcome measures improving. Does that have  
**[0:22:45-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:45):**  an impact?  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:46):**  You raise a really important point here. So what I would say we've done over the years,  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:51):**  those of us that have looked at these techniques, we've improved them in the sense that we've  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:22:55):**  simplified them. So outcome measures for me, you know, it's so simple and you think, well,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:00):**  why weren't we doing this 20 years ago? The truth is we weren't so focused. I don't know  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:05):**  why, but anyway, things evolve and outcome measures have a huge place in the sense that  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:09):**  they simplify what needs to be done. So instead of having literally hundreds of thousands  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:15):**  of input measures, you have a few outcome measures that then you can apply in every  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:20):**  situation across the world. So, you know, my mantra is lame cow is a lame cow wherever  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:24):**  she is in the world and we don't want lame cows. So that measure is a very simple measure  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:30):**  that we can apply and the solutions are many and varied, but it still comes down to the  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:35):**  same thing. Although we've simplified what needs doing, it still doesn't get done if  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:40):**  people, there's still a behaviour change needed to really take it on board. And some of that  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:46):**  now is coming through pressure, but I think this other angle that people like Jo and Suze  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:50):**  bring is so important. I just, you know, my personal story is it's very easy for me to  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:23:56):**  have kept on the animal welfare programme for all these years. I was born with it almost.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:01):**  That's why I became a vet and then I've done what I've done. It's something in me that  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:05):**  drives me to do that. What would be interesting was I had a seminal moment with someone that  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:10):**  stayed with me on the farm and I always used to ask people after they'd spent a period  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:15):**  of time, you know, have you seen anything on the farm that bothers you and things that,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:19):**  you know, that you want to, that you think we should be doing better? I was meaning in  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:22):**  terms of animal welfare and this one very mature student looked at me and she said to  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:27):**  me, yes, there's something that really bothers me, Ruth. And I thought, oh my gosh, I said,  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:31):**  what is it? She said, the fact that you don't recycle. And from that day on, I knew I should  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:35):**  be recycling. It was a long time ago now, but I didn't recycle. It's something that  
**[0:24:39-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:39):**  I came fairly because it wasn't top of my personal agenda.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:43):**  So it's about how to, how to lift those things up agenda so that, so that there are  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:47):**  sort of multiple, multiple outcomes, multiple public goods, if you like, that people are  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:53):**  focusing on and delivering at once. Joe, you've given us quite a, an extensive sort of background  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:24:58):**  around the science of, of human behaviour change. But I wonder, Suze, when we're talking  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:03):**  about it, are there shortcuts that we can, we can help listeners with? Are there sort  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:10):**  of categories of the types of change that we're talking about here?  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:14):**  Definitely. So some things, as we touched on earlier, could be a change through policy.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:20):**  So policy change can be a shortcut that might involve legislation as a tool. We were recently  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:26):**  reminded of this when Joe had a trip to Kenya for a research project. And even before she  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:32):**  went she was told that plastic bags are no longer allowed in Kenya. Kenya has just banned  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:37):**  plastic bags. We were really surprised to see how this worked in, in the real life,  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:42):**  because we know that often things aren't enforced and on the ground it's quite different to  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:47):**  what the situation is meant to be. But Joe reported back and lots of other reports show  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:51):**  that there has been a massive difference in if plastic bags aren't available and then  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:25:55):**  they can't be used. So sometimes legislation can and policy change can provide that shortcut.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:00):**  I think there's also shortcuts when we're interacting with people directly or interacting  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:04):**  with communities directly. And this is where some of the interesting psychology comes in.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:08):**  So for example, just by knowing that if we push an agenda too strongly, if we go in too  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:14):**  strongly with our views about why people should change, if we as animal welfareists really  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:20):**  underline that we think that animals have intrinsic rights to a life worth living, for  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:26):**  example, and if that isn't shared by the other person, we're likely to create what's called  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:30):**  reactants or they're going to push back against that because the more that the stronger we  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:35):**  come in with an opinion, we open up the likelihood that they will form the counter opinion in  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:41):**  their head. And the more people are given the opportunity to rehearse that opinion,  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:45):**  it's going to cement their viewpoint. And so that's a really interesting, easy win almost,  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:50):**  because if we are careful about the way that we frame our own agenda and that we frame  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:26:55):**  our own what we want to happen in a way that isn't going to trigger this reactants and  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:01):**  the other person, we're going to have a much more chance of a much better chance of creating  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:06):**  really constructive dialogue. So that's almost a shortcut in the way we interact with people  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:12):**  in the same way that we know that there's various cognitive biases that people work  
**[0:27:15-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:15):**  through. So we all see the world through a lens. We all bring to the party what our experiences  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:21):**  and as Jo introduced earlier, from our early life, from our parenting, from our education,  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:26):**  from the people we interact with and our social support networks. And we know that when we  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:31):**  are much more likely as humans to take on information, if it fits with what we already  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:35):**  believe in, then we are if some information comes in that counters that. And so again,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:41):**  by being careful about the way we frame things, we can try to frame it in a way that won't  
**[0:27:46-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:46):**  trigger that response in other people, that won't trigger their likelihood to shut down  
**[0:27:50-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:50):**  what we're saying. So that's another kind of a shortcut in terms of dialogue.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:53):**  And that feels like it sort of opens us into a range of other sort of elements. So we can  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:27:59):**  sort of break down that kind of how do we deal with reactants? And I'm thinking about  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:03):**  climate change and climate change denial. And if we look at Britain over the course  
**[0:28:07-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:07):**  of the last 20 or 30 years, and maybe climate change in the Conservative Party, then, you  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:14):**  know, we got Mrs. Thatcher in the 80s being the first politician to say that climate change  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:19):**  is a clear and present danger and that something needs to be done, but then something happens.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:23):**  And I wonder if it's this kind of, you know, climate change is taken on by the environmental  
**[0:28:27-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:27):**  community, it's then seen as being something that the left piggybacks to promote its own  
**[0:28:33-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:33):**  agenda of interventionalism, legislation, you know, big state. And so there's a reaction  
**[0:28:40-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:40):**  by by the more sort of right wing or conservative facets of society that some and again, something's  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:48):**  changed over the last few years, because now the Conservative Party just as the Labour  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:53):**  Party and you know, this around the world that people are starting to sort of recognise  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:28:57):**  that climate change is a clear and present danger. And so I wonder how that how we've  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:03):**  got past that reactants, whether it's been about the framing of the language that people  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:08):**  have been using, we're not talking about polar bears so much now we're talking about agricultural  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:12):**  land and financial risk.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:14):**  There has been some work undertaken in the conservation sector, looking at how the use  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:21):**  of positive framing can support and encourage people through through empowering them to  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:27):**  feel that they can actually take action. They looked at some of the previous messaging that  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:32):**  had gone on, which was sort of more negatively focused and found that actually people felt  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:37):**  quite disempowered and that they weren't able to take action. So I think that's potentially  
**[0:29:42-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:42):**  one factor. But it's also the situation where how you align these things to be more connected  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:52):**  to people's values, the things that they really care about, and actually making it very relevant  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:29:57):**  to their day to day lives. So I think there's been quite a bit of work to to bring it home  
**[0:30:02-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:02):**  to people how relevant this is to their the way they live, how it's connected to everything  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:08):**  they're doing and how it's going to impact on them as individuals. And I think that message  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:12):**  is getting through in a stronger, more impactful way. And as Ruth highlighted earlier in when  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:18):**  we were talking about the role that young people are taking on in terms of this, they're  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:25):**  taking on the responsibility of pushing it forward. And I think that in itself is shaking  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:29):**  the system up and making people reflect because our younger people are doing some of the things  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:35):**  that that maybe we should be shouting about as well. So I think there's a kind of a number  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:39):**  of different factors involved in why that's kind of getting more traction and being highlighted  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:45):**  more evidently.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:46):**  While you were saying that I was sort of thinking a little bit around as well the way in which  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:51):**  climate change has been presented, it continues to be presented as a big threat to society.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:30:57):**  But there, but actually some of the language that's coming out of government now, and more  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:02):**  out of business, is that it's also an opportunity. It's an opportunity to, it's an opportunity  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:08):**  for new industries and businesses to grow, you know, for example, within the renewables  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:12):**  sector. It's an opportunity, even if we don't care about the climate issue itself, to clean  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:18):**  up the air because air pollution is a problem. So I think it's partly what you were touching  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:22):**  on there around values. It's sort of finding different ways of presenting information so  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:27):**  that people who have taken a position are able, and physically and mentally able, to  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:33):**  change that position. That instead of it being a problem that you deal with by going backwards,  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:38):**  you can be progressive, you can move forwards into the future to solve climate change.  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:43):**  Very much so. It's that giving people the opportunity that there is, you know, that  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:47):**  they can take action and that they can actually do something positive and constructive that  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:52):**  will make improvements. And I think that's a really important point you're making there  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:31:58):**  about actually how it's almost being, as you say, it's being seen as an opportunity and  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:03):**  businesses now engaging as a result of that.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:05):**  Now, I wonder about the way that the environment has changed, even just in the last five or  
**[0:32:10-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:10):**  ten years, that social media has just boomed. It's very easy nowadays to just sit and exist  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:17):**  within your own bubble. And it's quite difficult to move out of that bubble. And I'm wondering,  
**[0:32:22-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:22):**  you know, if we were in the 1970s or the 1980s, whether somehow it would have been easier  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:29):**  to talk to people, to have, you know, an intelligent conversation with people. Do you think that  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:33):**  social media has damaged this sort of change that we're talking about? Has it made it harder?  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:39):**  I think it's probably made it different. So I think there's always challenges and advantages  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:44):**  and disadvantages with the technology that's available at any one time. So social media,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:49):**  yes, we it works by putting people in bubbles, the echo chamber effect, where the more you  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:32:56):**  look at a certain type of position or the more you look at certain resources, you're  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:00):**  more likely to get one that is similar. And so you're in a danger of being quite narrow  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:05):**  in what you're exposed to. But again, at the other side, of course, it's an amazing tool  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:10):**  for reaching vast amounts of people, forgetting information quickly around the world. And  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:15):**  so there's a huge advantages to it as well. I think what we need to work on as a society  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:20):**  is really nurturing the ability of the critical thinking for the just teaching people that  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:26):**  we are all in those bubbles. And I know that in some countries in Scandinavia, they are  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:31):**  really focusing on this actually in schools, they're teaching critical thinking, they're  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:36):**  making people aware that when you only listen to the same people in the same sources, you're  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:42):**  in danger of missing so much else out there. And I think it's important for us all to realize  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:47):**  that I really try to make an effort to go out of my way to seek out different sources  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:53):**  of information that I wouldn't normally go to, and to be aware of what's out there to  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:33:57):**  try to avoid that bubble effect. So I think that it's a challenge for modern day society.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:03):**  And there's answers out there, but it's going to be a rocky road, there's going to be some  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:07):**  good things, some real challenges. And we'll see how it all works out.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:13):**  There is a there is a real sense that social media has provided has brought light to dark  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:20):**  places. I mean, Iran is a great example of where suddenly there is information and transparency  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:25):**  coming out of a country that was traditionally quite hard to get information from. But it's  
**[0:34:30-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:30):**  it's kind of balancing that out, it seems with that tendency for people to listen to  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:36):**  people that they agree with, because it's easier, it's less challenging. And somehow  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:41):**  it's, it's encouraging more people to get outside of that bubble and, and talk to people,  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:47):**  I guess, not even just on social media, but talking to people in the town or village or  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:51):**  city that you live in, that you meet and finding out more about what they think as well.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:34:55):**  Exactly. So understanding human behavior change and the science of human behavior change isn't  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:01):**  optional anymore, it's going to become a necessity, because to succeed in getting your message  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:05):**  out to the people that you want to hear it, it's going to require an understanding of  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:09):**  behavior change. And without that the efficiency of your message is really going to be compromised.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:14):**  So, so let's, we're running out of time. So let's, let's move on to practical steps. Are  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:20):**  there, you know, if people are listening, and they're thinking, okay, so some of what's  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:24):**  being talked about here is really ringing, ringing true with me, there are things that  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:28):**  I would like to do better. There are messages that I need to communicate that somehow I'm  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:33):**  not managing to communicate as effectively as I as I want to. Can you give any sort of  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:39):**  practical tips, things that people should think about in order to improve their own  
**[0:35:45-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:45):**  communication skills?  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:46):**  I think it's, Susie's just been highlighting, it's, it's, first of all, as much as anything,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:52):**  it's understanding, the more you can understand. So that is about having conversations with  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:35:57):**  people who you may be, who are some who you are working with, but also people who are  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:04):**  maybe of a different viewpoint from you. So you can really understand kind of what the  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:08):**  resistance is, if there is resistance to change, the more you can understand that, and also  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:13):**  understand who is out there and who you're trying to communicate, the better. And I think  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:17):**  that's kind of one of the first key steps. We've talked about positive framing, and I  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:21):**  think looking at the language that you're using when you're having these conversations,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:27):**  and that might be through verbal communication or written communication, but thinking about  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:32):**  that kind of language that's being used, and if it can be positively framed to, to demonstrate  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:37):**  what's in it for the person you're trying to communicate with, why should they be interested?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:42):**  Why should they take action? We've talked about values and actually looking at values  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:46):**  based communications. What is it that the person you're communicating with, what do  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:51):**  they care about? What's going to resonate with them? Are there areas where you can align  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:36:56):**  your values from a point of view? Are there things that you share so you can have that  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:00):**  common ground? And when we're talking about verbal communications, one of the most important  
**[0:37:05-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:05):**  elements is actually the importance of listening. So both from a point of view of understanding,  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:10):**  but making sure that the person that you're communicating with really feels that they're  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:15):**  being, they have been listened to and they're being heard and that their issues and concerns  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:20):**  are being taken into account. So those are a few things from a, from a communication  
**[0:37:24-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:24):**  point of view. And I think it's, it's making sure that the clarity of message is getting  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:28):**  through and that the message itself is being tested. So it's asking for feedback. It's  
**[0:37:34-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:34):**  not always something that we as humans like to have, but the more we can actually ask  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:39):**  for feedback and take what people are saying, whether it's positive or critical and reflect  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:44):**  upon that because the reflections can really help us to develop on the way we communicate.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:50):**  Just sort of, you know, thinking about listening there, I wonder Ruth, if there are things  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:54):**  that you've heard during the course of the conversation or that you know about human  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:37:59):**  behaviour change that, that help you to draw any conclusions you know, why are facts not  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:05):**  enough? How can we get better at portraying the information that we have?  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:11):**  Yes, I guess I've, you know, I've already drawn some conclusions, which is why I was  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:16):**  keen to have this conversation, but you know, you listen to the conversation and it just  
**[0:38:20-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:20):**  deepens those conclusions. And to me, it comes down to, you know, in all of our interactions  
**[0:38:26-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:26):**  with each other, if we can stay in this place of care and respect for each other, that doesn't  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:32):**  mean agreement. And I think that's sometimes where these things go awry. They think, some  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:36):**  people seem to think if you, if you listen to people, it's an automatic, you're going  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:41):**  to agree. It's not about that. It's really about listening to each other with respect  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:46):**  and with integrity. And then we can find common ground, I think naturally arises from that  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:51):**  because when we understand each other better, we can look for that common ground and then  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:38:56):**  we can move forward. Otherwise, and I, you know, I totally get, I think Joe or Susan  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:01):**  were talking this thing about if we, if we are too heavy with people. And that's one  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:06):**  of the things if I had my time over again, you know, I was too hard on people, harder  
**[0:39:11-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:11):**  myself.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:12):**  I guess our passion at human behaviour change for animals is that the science is out there.  
**[0:39:17-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:17):**  The science about how to understand humans, what drives them to behaviours they do, and  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:23):**  also what drives them to change. The science is out there. We need to apply it. We need  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:27):**  to get creative and excited about harnessing the powerful information that the science  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:33):**  gives us, the evidence gives us. And through doing that, we can create a sustainable difference  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:38):**  and therefore sustainable change through collaborating together in a positive evidence-based way.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:43):**  And that this will, we really believe that this will therefore create positive change  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:48):**  for animals, for humans, for human animal and the planet as a whole.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:53):**  Fantastic. And I think, you know, a conclusion that I might draw is that, you know, humans  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:39:58):**  have been changing, have been evolving for, you know, for thousands of years, but there's  
**[0:40:03-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:03):**  something now, there's a certain level of crisis now, whether that's down to the way  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:09):**  that nature is reacting to human endeavour or the size of our populations or the diets  
**[0:40:16-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:16):**  that we have, whatever it is, there is a need to accelerate that change. And it seems that  
**[0:40:20-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:20):**  the human behaviour change, you know, the psychology around that and the things that  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:24):**  we've been talking about are about giving us the mechanisms to understand each other  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:29):**  better, to have more respect for each other, and to ensure that, you know, as a species,  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:35):**  we can not just change human behaviour, but change it fast enough that we still have a  
**[0:40:40-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:40):**  human species and indeed other species, you know, in the next hundred or two hundred years.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Why-are-facts-not-enough-ebjjlf#t=0:40:45):**  Well, thank you very much, everybody. That's been a really interesting conversation. I'd

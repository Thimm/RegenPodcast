**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. This is the fourth programme in our series  about agroecological agriculture. Today I'm finding out about vegetables and horticulture,  and I'm joined by two fantastic farmers putting agroecology into practice.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:21):**  Jo Rolfe is the General Manager at RB Organic Ltd in Norfolk, and Sinead Fenton runs Oreside  Farm with her partner Adam in East Sussex. You can follow Jo on Twitter by searching  for Farmer Jo, and Sinead is on Twitter and Instagram under the handle at oresidefarm.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:38):**  Jo and Sinead are working with the Soil Association as Agroecology Ambassadors and as part of  the Soil Association's 10 Years for Agroecology project. Welcome both!  Hello!  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:49):**  Hey, hi!  The scale at which you're each working is very different. Your customers are different  too, so I guess we'd better start by finding out about who you are, what you produce, how  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:58):**  large your farms are. Jo, can I come to you first? What do you grow and how much land  do you have available?  We are, first of all, we're 100% organic farmers and growers. We produce a range of crops,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:09):**  so organic carrots, potatoes and onions are sort of the core crops that we produce. And  we're actually tenants on two really large estates, so in terms of scale, we're producing  in the region of about 500 acres of veg and we have access to about 4,500 acres of organic  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:27):**  lands.  You say the farm's on two sites and I think they're 30 miles apart. How does that work  in practice? Do you have different kit for different farms? Are you trundling 30 miles  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:36):**  across the country on a regular basis?  So unfortunately, yes, we're doing the latter. We are sort of going between the two farms.  It's a difficult one if we had enough money, we'd have kit stationed at each farm. But  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:48):**  essentially we work out of one where we're based and we have a farm team and we keep  the majority of the kit there and then we'll travel between the two sites. You know, things  like irrigators and things like that, obviously we leave in situ, but you know, the bigger  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:03):**  bits of kit, the tractors and the implements will, the tropes between the two.  Now my knowledge of the part of the world in which you live, the East of England, is  that you can see just enormous fields. I mean, I used to live in a town that was triangulated  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:16):**  by spuds on one side, onions on another and carrots on the other. Is that kind of what  it's like? You just have really big fields and on one side, do you have the spuds and  the other side, the carrots?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:28):**  Not quite, no, no, no. I wouldn't say it's quite like that. We're quite fortunate if  you like that both of the estates that we farm at, they're very diverse rotations. So  there's multiple different crops being grown at any one point in time. It can rather feel  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:43):**  like we're surrounded by carrots when you're in amongst the thick of it in the growing  season. But no, it's not quite as bad as that. And I think we're blessed with, within Norfolk  by having lots of hedgerows and woodlands and trees. So it's quite a beautiful picturesque  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:56):**  location.  Sinead, your business is different in almost every way. So what do you grow and how much  land do you have available?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:03):**  Yeah, I mean, we're quite different and on a much, much smaller scale, I think we're  probably about 1% of the size of Joe's operation. We're on 4.5 acres of land, ex arable land.  It was growing maize for 30 years. And we're based down in East Sussex. We operate on a  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:21):**  market garden style kind of framework. So we use a lot of permanent beds, grow quite  a wide range of produce, and the core of which is edible flowers, heritage veg, salads and  culinary herbs. And our focus is really about celebrating the diversity of the edible world  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:36):**  and growing a lot of the crops that can't really be grown on that kind of like big commercial  scale.  When I was a kid, I went to a market garden, everything would be in the ground. Whereas  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:44):**  these days, you know, even if you're going picking strawberries, often they were up in  these sort of raised beds, and sort of raised small polytunnels almost. Is that what it's  like on your farm?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:54):**  A little bit. So we use a system called no dig. So we haven't motivated the soil, we,  what we do is we put quite a lot of compost, and then we grow into that. And then the idea  is that worms will kind of take it in. So the beds are slightly raised, but not by too  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:07):**  much. And that's primarily to just try and get organic matter back into the soil. And  we have two polytunnels at the moment, but they're quite, they're quite small on the  grand scheme of things.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:15):**  But those raised beds that you're talking about, they're beds where the soil that's  inside is based on the soil down below. Is that right? Rather than sort of being up on  trestles?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:25):**  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's all on the ground. And that's a primary kind of focus of being  organic that you have to grow with the soil. And so nothing's above ground.  And on Instagram, you have quite a lot of pictures. And there's a lot of diversity within  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:38):**  that four and a half acres that you have. I saw a fantastic pond that you developed  there for nature this morning as well. There's a lot going on.  We've tried to create, I guess, lots of different hubs within the farm. We've put down a woodland,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:50):**  which we won't get anything from that for a while, but an acre and a half of it is down  to woodland. We've put in new hedgerows, there's ponds as well. And it's all about creating  different environments that one, we can then go and grow different crops in at different  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:02):**  times in the future. So like mushrooms in the woodland, we can grow kind of wet loving  plants in the pond areas, all with the idea of kind of creating more kind of wildlife  spots throughout the farm. That's a real basis of how we manage kind of our ecosystem is  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:17):**  bringing back the things that aren't really there anymore.  And who are your main customers?  So mostly restaurants, obviously, Covis has been a bit of a challenge to that. Our main  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:27):**  business, so we used to do this back in London, was to sell to a restaurant in London. We  were going to try and create a new market down here. We're quite close to Brighton and  Brighton has quite a similar food scene to London as well. This year we moved online.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:40):**  We were pushed to because everything was shut and we didn't have enough kind of space and  cultivation to be able to sell into existing veg boxes or wholesalers. So yeah, we started  posting flowers in the post.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:52):**  You talk about, you know, sort of selling into restaurants directly. And I think that's  different to anybody else that we've spoken to within this series. Have you just sort  of trampled the streets of London and beaten the doors of chefs or how have you managed  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:05):**  to build up that side of your sort of customer base?  Yeah, I mean, it was a little bit like that. It was kind of going in being a bit crass,  I guess, with a massive box of flowers and veg and then just going into restaurants.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:16):**  Hey, look at all of this fabulous produce that we grow. Do you want it? That's kind  of what we did maybe like three years ago. I think I was a bit braver back then just  marching into places. A lot of it's also from Instagram. Lots of chefs are on Instagram.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:29):**  Lots of restaurants are on Instagram as well. So us kind of showing the really kind of colourful  unusual veg that they often can't get a hold of. People started getting in touch with us  from that. So yeah, it kind of grew quite organically.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:42):**  The importance of social media, particularly for smaller independent growers. Joe, you  grow a serious volume of carrots and potatoes and onions. Who are your customers?  So we supply into the retail industry, if you like, in the UK. We also supply to the  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:59):**  wholesale marketplace down in London. And we also export as and when required if we've  got surplus as a crop and the market's not overly buoyant in the UK.  So do you find yourself putting some veggies in boxes and knocking on Mr Waitrose's door,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:14):**  that sort of thing?  Yeah, I mean, from time to time, we certainly do. When we're looking at, you know, I would  class it as MPD or added value products. So, you know, if we were looking at coloured carrots  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:23):**  or Chantenay carrots or something that's a little bit outside the ordinary, you know,  different coloured potatoes with different textures and tastes and agronomic reasons  for growing, then we often get told we should be camping in our customers' foyers and, you  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:37):**  know, making sure that we've shown them our ideas. So yeah, we're certainly not averse  to doing that.  And if we wanted to go and buy some of your root vegetables, I take it that you're pretty  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:47):**  much in every one of the big five retailers in the UK?  So I haven't gone into the details of the grower group that we've passed off, but we're  one of five other growers in the UK that form a grower group called the British Organic  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:02):**  Carrot Growers Group. Collectively, we make up probably 90% of any organic carrot bought  in the UK. So I'd like to say yes, you could pick up our carrots at a given time of the  year in most retail shops, but they may not have come directly from ourselves. They could  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:17):**  have come from someone else in that grower group.  World Finance, with your... I mean, if you've got 1,000 acres, and a little bit of it's  unproductive, you can stick a bit of it out to woodland. Perhaps it's not quite so important.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:29):**  With four and a half acres, every square metre you have counts in terms of making your farm  pay. Do you find that profit and ecology create competing demands for you?  I don't personally, no. I think the two have to go hand in hand. I think you can have one  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:43):**  without the other. Not long term, and we're here for the long run. We've got a 150 year  lease. We have to think about the long term here. So we could go and make loads of money  really quickly, we could cultivate the whole space, we could get started, but that's not  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:57):**  going to help us in the long run. There's a lot of other issues that we have to fix  here. This land is really susceptible to flooding. On the flip side, it's also really susceptible  to droughts. It has quite an unusual microclimate, and we're quite low-lying from the south down.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:11):**  So we need to be doing stuff to make sure that we can use this land to create a profit  and to bring in finance. There are spaces where we've put in a woodland, so at the back  where a lot of the water that comes into us. People might think that an acre and a half  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:26):**  of woodland on this space is actually quite a lot, but that's coppicing material. There's  100 walnuts in there, so that's nut trees. There's 200 hazelnuts, so that's hazelnut  trees in the future. A lot of those trees are made up of foraging trees, so a lot of  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:40):**  the work that we do, or we used to do, was a lot of foraging work for chefs and restaurants.  So we've been able to build in different things that will come into production and  come into a revenue stream down the line, but also have the benefit of creating wildlife  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:54):**  spots for us, helping with soil compaction that we've got here, helping with lots of  different things, but ultimately always being able to feed into key revenue streams and  adding new products. You talked about the land being prone to flooding. I mean, presumably,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:09):**  you can't just instantly change from veg and nasturtiums to watercress. So how do you  handle that sort of thing? At the moment, it's, so this is our first season here. So  this winter is really where we're getting an idea of how the water flows, where the  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:23):**  pockets are, where we're getting pooling. So in some of those spaces, we've been like,  okay, there's loads of water pooling there. It probably wants to be a pond. Let's make  it a pond. And we can use that as a water storage space. So then, say, like irrigating  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:36):**  our crops in the polytunnel or using it for kind of irrigation in the summer as well.  So it's, it's kind of just, I guess, listening to some of those spots and being like, okay,  that's probably not going to be an area that we can grow much in. And also looking at plants  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:48):**  that like wet spaces. So things like meadowsweet, we can harvest those for edible flowers too.  It's just looking at what type of plants can we use to go into those areas that maybe we  can't get profit from in a vegetable, but that's fine because there's other stuff that  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:02):**  we can put there. It's really interesting listening to you talking, because it sounds  like, you know, on a small scale, when we think about the proportions of woodland or  ponds or what you're doing with the land there, it's actually not dissimilar to the  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:15):**  proportions that people like George in previous podcasts have talked about, you know, with  their, their larger spaces. So it's, it's really interesting. It's a microcosm. Now,  Joe, you're both Soil Association Organic certified. For you, Joe, how important is  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:29):**  that certification to your customers?  Oh, well, it's hugely important, actually. So obviously, we've come on stage to talk  about agroecology. And I think, you know, I want to be really clear that we're, we're  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:40):**  organic, and agroecology sort of fits part of that. We're obviously certified, which  means we have to go through quite a vigorous inspection on a yearly annual basis. And that  means, you know, there's a whole ream of standards that we must achieve every year.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:56):**  And to be honest, I guess they do become more of just a way of daily life, if you like,  we sort of become so used to those principles, those standards, they're just kind of normal  to us now. But in terms of the benefit, then to our customers into the marketplace is that  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:10):**  they know without question, they can trust us and what they're buying is truly organic.  And that, you know, the principles of the Soil Association set are what I would class  as a sort of gold standard. So I think that's really important. And obviously, there is  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:25):**  a difference in terms of, generally there's a difference in the cost of organic produce  when you're picking that up. But you know, I want people to be fully bought into the  principles behind what we do and why we do it. And therefore, you know, you're paying  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:38):**  for sustainability and environmentally friendly farming. And it's got a guarantee on it,  essentially. So it's a sort of brand, it's the transparency and accountability. And Sinead,  you're also there, you're paid up, organic certified. For a smaller business, that's,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:53):**  you know, it's a lot of money and a lot of paperwork. Why is the certification so important  to you? Yeah, I mean, I completely agree with what Joe said. I think for us, we kind of see  it as like, it's really important for us to support the things that we believe in, not  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:08):**  only in terms of growing, but also like at a policy level and public engagement level.  We kind of see the Soil Association as like doing that work for us. So this is our contribution  towards that. You know, I think our food system is at a really pivotal point right now. And  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:21):**  a lot of things are changing. We're seeing a lot of changes already. And for us personally,  transparency and accountability are really, really important to our business and to how we think the  food system should move forward. Becoming a Soil Association organic certified farm was the kind  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:37):**  of way for us to feel like we were actively a part of that and not just putting words to things and  not actions. It is a cost that, you know, hopefully we'll sell enough flowers and veg to cover it and  it will be okay. Joe, as an organic producer, you're not using pesticides or insecticides.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:54):**  What do you do instead on your, you know, your big fields of veg to manage pests and keep up the  yields that you need? Well, I don't know how long you've got, but we're doing quite a few different  things actually. Fundamentally, I think the kind of principles of organic farming for me are  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:12):**  prevention is better than cure. So, you know, we're in a position now where technology and  science and data to move on to such a stage that having access to that allows us to make better  decisions first and foremost. I think if you then start to look at the fact that yes, we can't use  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:27):**  artificial chemicals and fertilizers and such like it, it then becomes very important in terms of  where your farms are, the type of rotations they have. So looking at things like soil health and  biodiversity and also looking at the wider environment. So, you know, one of the things  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:43):**  that we've really worked hard on with the farms and the estate teams is having sort of beneficial  insect habitats around the farm where, you know, we're not going into a field that's completely  sort of barren and everything's been killed. There is actually quite a good balance of insects,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:01):**  if you like, around and such like. So, you know, that's been really critical finding good resilient  farming systems, if you like, that have got these things built into them. Over and above that,  in terms of what we can actively do ourselves, we've started moving back towards having smaller  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:19):**  plots within a field. So, you know, if we've got a 25 acre field of carrots, we'll split that into  maybe four or five sections and we'll try and establish flower sort of borders or equivalent  of what an old beetle bank may have once been sort of seen as. And again, we'll try and encourage  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:36):**  insects to get right down into the field. And we've actually gone through a process over the  last three or four years of bringing in insects and actually releasing them into the field with  that mindset that when pests come in, obviously the pressure builds up over time and then the  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:53):**  beneficials will come in at a later stage and sort of naturally build up after them. So, we're,  if you like, trying to reverse that and get the population of beneficials to such a level that  when pests come in, they're kind of ready and fit to fight them off. So, to kind of summarise those  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:08):**  things to an extent, you're talking about, you know, using technology and data, changing and  being really careful with the rotation, building up the soil health and the biodiversity there so  that everything is healthier, which sort of contributes to that sort of additional resilience.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:22):**  And it's interesting because we often mention the word diversity on this podcast. And recently  somebody said, well, you know, you can have, if you go to the zoo, the zoo is diverse, but what it  isn't is connected. And so, what you're talking about is trying to build that connectivity between  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:38):**  everything that's living so that nature manages itself to a better extent.  Absolutely. I think a really good way to put that across in layman's terms, you know, if you imagine  a human being, when you're not particularly healthy, you might, you know, you've got  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:54):**  different gut bacteria, you're unhealthy, you're more likely to pick up an illness. If you're  fighting fit, you're much more likely to be able to fight off illness. And I see soil is exactly  the same. I see rotation exactly the same. If you've got a good fit, healthy soil with living  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:11):**  organisms, they're able to look after themselves. And we very rarely touch wood to see disease in  our veg crops. Whereas I know in non-organic systems where chemicals have come in and just  killed everything and almost made it a barren wasteland, if you like, they're getting disease  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:26):**  after disease after disease, because it's the first thing that comes back. The bad insect is  the first one that comes back. You know, it's that type of mindset that we're trying to kind of get  away from.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:35):**  Sinead, is that kind of the same thing that you do on your space?  Yeah, absolutely. It's, you know, it's all about creating balance throughout the entire year. And  I think we're quite fortunate that first and foremost, we are a flower farm. So, those are  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:49):**  the things that a lot of our insects and wildlife eat. So, having an abundance of that across the  farm attracts a lot of kind of beneficial insects into our operation. And that was the first thing  that we did last year. Like last year was quite a write off for us. But we like the first thing we  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:04):**  have to do is plant loads of flowers everywhere so that we can start enticing the insects in and let  them know that we're here and there's lots of food for them. And you know, it's the same as, you  know, creating like those small ponds, we've seen toads in those, we've left our grasses really long,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:18):**  we've seen grass snakes in those. We let a lot of our grasses kind of go to seed or a lot of our  plants go to seed. Those are really good for bringing in birds. So, it's yeah, a lot of stuff  that we do is all driven by wildlife and how do we create balance within the system.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:31):**  Now, you mentioned COVID earlier on Sinead. And you've been on, I think, quite a decent personal  journey during the whole COVID pandemic. Because you were saying before that your sort of key  customer base was chefs, people stopped going to restaurants. And so you've turned to online  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:49):**  retail. Have you been able to make that shift okay? Have you been able to find the online  customers? I think we got started a bit late. So, I mean, we were quite unfortunate in that we moved  to this site two days before lockdown happened. And that pretty much just wrote off everything.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:05):**  But it also meant that a water connection that we were supposed to get here didn't happen. So,  we only had our water connected last month. So, it meant that we couldn't really do a lot. We were  able to do sunflowers, but we just we didn't really have enough quantity to really make it  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:19):**  work very well. But it was enough to kind of just like keep us going and to let us know that okay,  when we're operational next year, and we have more space, and we have water, we will be okay.  It has been hard. And that switch has been, it was something that we weren't really kind of prepared  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:34):**  for. It wasn't really something we wanted to do. And we were kind of pushed towards it. But it has  been, it has been okay. And there were sort of other issues that perhaps, you know, people  wouldn't instantly think about that seem to have been causing you quite a lot of angst. You know,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:47):**  I've seen some of your posts on Instagram where you're talking about packaging and the use of  plastic in the online business. Do you think this is something that you can solve mentally  and ethically as well as physically? I'm not entirely sure. I think we've, we were kind of  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:02):**  pushed to go online, which then means, you know, we have to use plastic punnets, we have to use  plastic ice packs, and then we stick them into a box. And then we like stuff the boxes with lots  of wood shavings to just so they don't get damaged. That's a lot of packaging. And for us to  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:15):**  kind of sit on our soapbox talking about the environment. There's just a lot of hypocrisy in  it. And I think that's something that we wanted to put our hands up and say, you know, we're not  ignoring this issue. We are fully aware, we feel guilty, we feel responsible, and we do need to do  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:29):**  better. I think a huge part of the issue is that there's just nothing available for the organic  grower. There's stuff that you can use called the gas fee, which is like kind of cardboard  pulp punnets, but they're all growing with GM corn, so you can't use them as an organic grower.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:43):**  And I've emailed them so many times just being like, please, will you do something? There's  people that want this stuff. But it's, I mean, I'm one person that's quite insignificant to these  large companies. So it's not going to happen. I think I think we've just decided that we're going  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:54):**  to put our foot down with ourselves about it, that we'll do the fresh flowers this year, just to kind  of help us get out of the situation that we're in right now. But going forward, we'll only do it as  like a local or into restaurant, and then our online stuff will be dried flowers.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:08):**  Paul That's what I was going to say,  you were sort of moving into the dried flower element.  Anna Yeah, absolutely. And that was always our plan.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:14):**  It was our plan to kind of, in terms of the public facing stuff that we wanted to do,  we wanted to do something that had like a longer shelf life that we could use better packaging,  like tin or glass that can be reused. Yeah, I think it's just going back to that and not being  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:27):**  strayed by like, okay, well, there's a bit of easy money here, we could continue going down that and  then we could end up getting stuck in a bit of a trap of not being able to get out of that. So I  think we've just kind of had to put our foot down with ourselves, just so we feel like we can sleep  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:40):**  a bit better at night. Paul  And Joe, as Managing Director at RB Organic, you're responsible for the packing as well as the growing  what sort of sustainability challenges do you face in terms of the packaging?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:49):**  Paul Yeah, so similar sort of issues really, we're hugely aware of the environmental impact and you  know, the blue planet last year or the year before now, you know, I think that's really raised the  awareness for a wide range of people. I think we take a slightly different stance in that,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:07):**  you know, for us plastic is almost a necessary evil because, you know, there is an element with  our products that if you take away plastic at this stage, then the waste percentage goes up because  it does actually serve a purpose for kind of preserving, you know, the products. I think the  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:22):**  other thing is that, like with everything, whilst plastic isn't the best, it's also not necessarily  or rather, there's not necessarily a suitable alternative out there. We talk about paper and  cardboard and other options. Well, you know, they come at a cost financially and they also come at  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:40):**  a cost environmentally and I don't think we truly understand what that actually is. You know, we're  sort of doing lots of work at the moment looking at different alternative options. Our customers  are doing the same and, you know, there's lots of work going on in the background to see, you know,  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:55):**  what sort of suitable alternatives are out there. But I don't think it's going to be a quick fix by  any means. Where's the pressure coming from though, Joe? Is the pressure coming, you know,  is it pressure that you're putting on yourself because of your interest in packaging and being  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:09):**  more sustainable or is that pressure coming from your customers directly? It's both, to be honest,  is absolutely both. I think we ourselves have, you know, we're constantly looking at it because  packaging is not cheap. So we're always looking at reducing the microns. In actual fact, the plastic  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:26):**  that we put all our products in at the moment is what we call LDPE, which means that in theory,  it's all recyclable. But unfortunately, there's very few county councils around the country that  can actually deal with that type of plastic. They don't have the facilities to actually recycle it.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:40):**  So that in itself, you know, could be part of the solution if the government was actually  put some money into facilities that could deal with these things. And certainly as a business,  I think, yeah, our sort of principles at heart would certainly shy us away from plastics in the  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:55):**  future if there was a suitable alternative. But what I don't want to do is go down the road of  something that's worse or get to a stage where people are wasting produce because it's going  off in the fridge. It's interesting, you're talking about the complexity of this issue.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:09):**  And you're right, you know, the life cycles, the life systems of all these different options,  you know, we do need to understand them better. You've also talked about data and using data on  your farm. You're clearly quite invested in the detail in terms of a whole range of different  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:24):**  processes. And I wonder what role technology plays for you more generally on the farm.  Yeah, one of the benefits to scale is supposedly efficiency. Whether that's entirely true,  I would challenge because I think attention to detail can never be beaten and attention to detail  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:41):**  requires people on the ground doing the job hands on, quite frankly. But I think, yeah, technology  in the broader sense has certainly allowed us to make quicker, better decisions because we're,  you know, we've just got it at hands as and when you need it. I think if you look back over the  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:58):**  last 10 years, we've gone away from a paper-based system. You know, we've moved to tractors having  GPS and RTK, which makes them far more accurate and efficient. You know, the guys have all got  iPads now. So, you know, any work that's done on the farm is automatically just transferred onto  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:15):**  computer systems. So, we're recording everything that we do in quite a joined up fashion, if you  like. And, you know, from a financial perspective, again, I think making good, quick decisions has  been so key. It's an interesting balance, isn't it? You have GPS and you were talking about that  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:31):**  25-acre field of carrots where you split it up into three or four different sections with  flour margins in the middle. And I'm kind of getting a picture of even hedgerows being able  to go back there in due course because you might have tractors that are driverless, electric,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:49):**  they're quiet, they're working through the night on a GPS, they don't need the daylight. Can you  see a future where that's happening? A hundred percent. And I think we're all already a long  way down that road, to be honest. I mean, I've not touched on some of the schemes that we're  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:04):**  part of at the moment, but we're certainly looking at electric vehicles, robotic wheeling machines.  You know, we already use lots of different soil moisture probes, which are all put out in the  fields and they connect to satellite dishes and then back to the office. So, yeah, I mean,  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:20):**  you know, even to the extent now where when a tractor stops in the field, we get a text on the  phone and it says that tractor stopped, but you know, here's a load of information. This is what  time it started, this is what diesel it's been using, so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think we're  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:34):**  a long way down that road already. So, you're clearly crunching a lot of data and, you know,  there's lots of information coming from those probes and so on, as you were saying. Do you  think that those probes and the data that's coming back from, you know, from inside the field is ever  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:48):**  going to be entirely able to replace those more traditional instincts of human beings, you know,  for what the weather's going to do or when to take in the harvest? Is there going to be an algorithm  that says this is what you need to do today? Interesting question, because we were having this  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:03):**  debate this morning with an angry tech scientist, I think was his title, but he was almost saying  yes and no to the same question. Yes, a lot of what people do will be replaced, there's no two  ways about it and I think it will only make us better in terms of the output, but equally,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:21):**  I'm sorry to say there's no substitute for taking Spain and sticking it in the ground and having to  look and, you know, grabbing hold of the soil in their own two hands. You just can't substitute  that, I don't think. I sense in you that there is, you know, at the same time as you say that,  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:37):**  you're clearly really interested in the tech and, you know, sort of keeping an eye on it.  Is there a robot that you'd really like to have for the farm but isn't yet in development?  The single biggest cost to our business at the moment is hand weeding. So, we bring in,  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:52):**  in sort of June, July for about six to eight weeks, anywhere up to about 100 people and  their sole purpose in life for that period of time is to pick weeds. So, I think if we could  find something that means we don't need that cost and the hassle quite frankly, then that would be  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:10):**  the ultimate for us. You talk about, you know, people coming in, their sole purpose is weeding.  You know, one of the things that we often hear about is that finding local people to do that  can be quite a challenge. Are you reliant on people, you know, coming over from Europe to  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:26):**  do that in the season? Is Brexit going to affect you in that way? I don't know yet, is the honest  answer. We're very fortunate because here in Western Norfolk, we're very close to quite a few  big towns. So, Kingsland is not too far away, about 10 miles away. And obviously, you know,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:42):**  there's a very rural agricultural area. So, there's quite a few other different types of farms,  but they all use a degree of labour. So, it would be wrong to say that these are local English-born  people, but we generally have a good source of labour. And there may be second or even third  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:01):**  generation, possibly Lithuanian, Polish backgrounds. But to me, I still class them as local  because as I say, if they're second or third generation, then they're living in the local  towns and have been for quite some time. So, it's not been an issue for us yet. But that's not to  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:17):**  say it won't be in the future because frankly, people don't want to be outside when it's raining  and cold and work in long hours, you know. They'd sooner be inside and wrapped up warm.  Sianaid, I imagine there's lots of rain and cold on your farm at the moment. Does technology help  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:33):**  you with that? Do you use technology on your farm as well?  Sianaid Bhandari We're quite basic. I think the most high-tech  thing I have here is a drill and a wheelbarrow. Yeah, it's quite a back-to-basic setup. I mean,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:46):**  part of that's just money. Like, we can't afford much else other than just eating a lot of food  to keep our arms going and lifting things. But yeah, I think in terms of the tech that we do use,  it probably comes down to data, you know, tracking information in terms of the sales that we do and  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:04):**  the kind of revenue streams. A lot of the plants that we grow have several different outlets and  identify what outlet's the best. But yeah, I think really it's kind of like tech for admin that we  use and not really any tech to do what we're doing.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:16):**  World Finance, what do you think about the way in which some of the things that you grow – the salad leaves and  the edible flowers – there are people using old factories and underground stations, old tube  tunnels in London and other cities. What do you think about the way that hydroponics are being  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:33):**  used in urban farms? Sianaid Bhandari It's a tough one. I don't  want to come off as dismissive, and this is something I've been kind of wrestling with and  thinking. But yeah, I grow in soil, I advocate for soil health, I advocate for wildlife and the role  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:46):**  of wildlife within our lives and our farms. The access to nature for its wellbeing purposes,  and you just don't get that with those systems. I think that aside, I think we're yet to kind of see  one of those systems that works economically. You see a lot of start-ups, they come and go.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:03):**  And I think there needs to be a question around the kind of environmental side of that. The amount  of materials that are used from the plastics, the trays that are being used to grow in, to the racks  that are being used, to the lights that are replicating the sun, to the things that are  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:18):**  generating heat. There's a lot of material involved in those set-ups, whereas I guess in my  set-up, I take a feed and I put it in the ground, Bob's your uncle, we're done. And I think that's  something that's often overlooked in those systems. And I think generally a lot of money  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:32):**  goes into those systems for thinking that they're more sustainable, that they're the future of  everything, but to kind of replicate one, what the sun does for us, and two, what clouds do for us in  watering and what the soil does for us in terms of providing nutrients, it just seems like a bit  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:50):**  misplaced. Actually that money could really go towards doing a lot of the stuff that Joe's talked  about in terms of increasing efficiency and going into research for actual farms to become more  productive or to streamline things more. Yeah, I personally feel like it's a bit misplaced,  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:07):**  that kind of faith in those systems.  Jason Vale,  Chief Executive Officer,  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:17):**  Defra,  Why do you think that is?  Why does it matter?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:18):**  I think often if you have the same people using the same methods on the same kind of scale,  often talking about things, where can progress come into that sometimes? And I think sometimes  having an outlier and having someone that's doing things a little bit differently at a different  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:32):**  scale can bring in a different way of thinking and also, you know, challenge some of the thoughts  that might go around in those circles. And likewise, the other way too, I think it's  important that those conversations are had because ultimately we're all trying to progress to the  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:45):**  same thing, but we have to work together and we can't just ignore a section of food producers  that are bringing food to the plate for lots of people.  Absolutely. And I can see entirely why it would be important for Defra to listen to you and to  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:59):**  other people working at the scale that you are. Do you think that there's a difference that Defra  ought to be making for you and your business? I think in terms of making our lives easier,  is one having us a part of the conversation. So I am not entitled to any support whatsoever.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:13):**  But I, out of my own money, have planted an acre and a half of woodland, 500 meters of hedgerow,  200 meters of shelterbelt, which will benefit the wider area. We're here surrounded by lots of  other larger arable fields. What we're doing here will indirectly benefit other farms. And I think  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:30):**  that should be recognized in terms of, you know, small clusters of farms that are growing different  types of things and a big diversity of crops, like the wider benefits that can have to other systems  and other people nearby. And yeah, I think, you know, some of that financial help would be nice.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:44):**  And even just help in terms of access to information or access to capital, etc. It's not  fair that a lot of people get ignored. And I think it's an accessibility issue as well. You know, I'm  not from a farming background. I'm from a city. My only option into farming is to do it kind of small  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:59):**  scale. There's a lot of people in that space too that are unsupported at the moment. Now I'm 48,  and we've been having this conversation for a very long time. Do you feel that there should be  some kind of central plan driven by government delivered much more substantially by local  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:15):**  authorities in order to make sure that there are those sorts of spaces in every community?  Yeah, absolutely. You know, I think small farms and like farms in general, way back before they  were like a real, like a central bedrock of a community. They were the thing that brought  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:30):**  people together. There's nothing that can bring people together like food can. And I think we're  particularly living in like quite a polarizing time at the moment. And if there's one way you can  bring people together, it's to bring people together through food and a sense of community.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:42):**  So I do think it's really important. And I think there's a huge role in terms of addressing lots of  issues around food insecurity and access to nature for people that maybe don't necessarily get out  into green spaces very often. There's so many other things that farms could contribute into,  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:57):**  and it just needs a joined up effort rather than lots of isolated silos that aren't really,  you know, talking to one another. Joe, do you engage with the public at all?  Yeah, we do. I think before I answer that question, I'd just like to back up what  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:12):**  Shanno was saying there. I'd love to know if anybody in Defra even knew what five hectares  look like. I think it's absolutely shocking that they don't recognize it. And they talk all the  time about public goods for, you know, for the public. And to me, what Shanno has just described  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:28):**  there is exactly that. So, you know, the days of giving people support because they own land  should be long gone. You know, it should be because you're doing something that's beneficial  to you and the community that you serve, if you like. But in terms of dealing with the sort of  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:45):**  the consumer base, we host no end to different visits throughout the season. We take part in  leaf open farm Sunday. And like Shanno, we do lots of different videos online and, you know,  we're constantly communicating where we can, the message as to what we do. And yeah, I think we  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:02):**  actively encourage that. I've always said that if I could get every man, woman and child onto farm  and show them what we do, I'm convinced that I could get them to buy our produce in the shops.  Jason Vale, so we're coming to the end of the program. And I just wonder if there are things  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:15):**  for both of you that you've learned the hard way, you know, that you might do differently if you had  your time again. Joe? Joe  Not big ones, I think. We've on too many occasions thought, yeah, let's go in this direction and  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:37):**  moved everything. And then it's been a disaster. So do things in incremental steps and just take  your time. Yeah. Jason Vale  What about you, Sinead? What's been hardest for you? And what do you wish somebody had  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:48):**  told you early on that you had to find out the hard way?  Sinead Well, one, a global pandemic was going to happen two days before we moved to that. That  might have been nice to know. It could have been helpful. It would have been helpful. But no,  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:38:00):**  I completely agree with what Joe said. I think we kind of bulldozed our way like into here,  just like, okay, we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we're going to do this and  try to take on too much too quickly. And you end up kind of diluting how good you can do things.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:38:14):**  And I think if I was to come into it again, I'd probably just focus on one part of what we're  doing, do it well, and get it established. Then on to the next thing, rather than trying to like  stress ourselves out with trying to do everything in one go.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:38:27):**  Joe Both, this has been absolutely fantastic. I feel like I've just had a sort of private  seminar. That's all we have time for. I'd like to thank my guests Sinead Fenton from Oreside Farm  and Joe Rolf from RB Organic Ltd.

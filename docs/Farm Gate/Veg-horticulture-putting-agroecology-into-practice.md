### Farm Gate  (Mon, 08 Mar 2021 17:25:09)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. This is the fourth programme in our series  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:11):**  about agroecological agriculture. Today I'm finding out about vegetables and horticulture,  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:16):**  and I'm joined by two fantastic farmers putting agroecology into practice.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:21):**  Jo Rolfe is the General Manager at RB Organic Ltd in Norfolk, and Sinead Fenton runs Oreside  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:27):**  Farm with her partner Adam in East Sussex. You can follow Jo on Twitter by searching  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:32):**  for Farmer Jo, and Sinead is on Twitter and Instagram under the handle at oresidefarm.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:38):**  Jo and Sinead are working with the Soil Association as Agroecology Ambassadors and as part of  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:43):**  the Soil Association's 10 Years for Agroecology project. Welcome both!  
**[0:00:48-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:48):**  Hello!  
**[0:00:49-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:49):**  Hey, hi!  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:50):**  The scale at which you're each working is very different. Your customers are different  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:53):**  too, so I guess we'd better start by finding out about who you are, what you produce, how  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:00:58):**  large your farms are. Jo, can I come to you first? What do you grow and how much land  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:02):**  do you have available?  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:03):**  We are, first of all, we're 100% organic farmers and growers. We produce a range of crops,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:09):**  so organic carrots, potatoes and onions are sort of the core crops that we produce. And  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:15):**  we're actually tenants on two really large estates, so in terms of scale, we're producing  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:21):**  in the region of about 500 acres of veg and we have access to about 4,500 acres of organic  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:27):**  lands.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:28):**  You say the farm's on two sites and I think they're 30 miles apart. How does that work  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:31):**  in practice? Do you have different kit for different farms? Are you trundling 30 miles  
**[0:01:36-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:36):**  across the country on a regular basis?  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:38):**  So unfortunately, yes, we're doing the latter. We are sort of going between the two farms.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:43):**  It's a difficult one if we had enough money, we'd have kit stationed at each farm. But  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:48):**  essentially we work out of one where we're based and we have a farm team and we keep  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:54):**  the majority of the kit there and then we'll travel between the two sites. You know, things  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:01:58):**  like irrigators and things like that, obviously we leave in situ, but you know, the bigger  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:03):**  bits of kit, the tractors and the implements will, the tropes between the two.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:06):**  Now my knowledge of the part of the world in which you live, the East of England, is  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:11):**  that you can see just enormous fields. I mean, I used to live in a town that was triangulated  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:16):**  by spuds on one side, onions on another and carrots on the other. Is that kind of what  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:22):**  it's like? You just have really big fields and on one side, do you have the spuds and  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:27):**  the other side, the carrots?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:28):**  Not quite, no, no, no. I wouldn't say it's quite like that. We're quite fortunate if  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:32):**  you like that both of the estates that we farm at, they're very diverse rotations. So  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:38):**  there's multiple different crops being grown at any one point in time. It can rather feel  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:43):**  like we're surrounded by carrots when you're in amongst the thick of it in the growing  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:46):**  season. But no, it's not quite as bad as that. And I think we're blessed with, within Norfolk  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:51):**  by having lots of hedgerows and woodlands and trees. So it's quite a beautiful picturesque  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:56):**  location.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:02:57):**  Sinead, your business is different in almost every way. So what do you grow and how much  
**[0:03:02-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:02):**  land do you have available?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:03):**  Yeah, I mean, we're quite different and on a much, much smaller scale, I think we're  
**[0:03:08-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:08):**  probably about 1% of the size of Joe's operation. We're on 4.5 acres of land, ex arable land.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:16):**  It was growing maize for 30 years. And we're based down in East Sussex. We operate on a  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:21):**  market garden style kind of framework. So we use a lot of permanent beds, grow quite  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:25):**  a wide range of produce, and the core of which is edible flowers, heritage veg, salads and  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:32):**  culinary herbs. And our focus is really about celebrating the diversity of the edible world  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:36):**  and growing a lot of the crops that can't really be grown on that kind of like big commercial  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:40):**  scale.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:41):**  When I was a kid, I went to a market garden, everything would be in the ground. Whereas  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:44):**  these days, you know, even if you're going picking strawberries, often they were up in  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:48):**  these sort of raised beds, and sort of raised small polytunnels almost. Is that what it's  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:53):**  like on your farm?  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:54):**  A little bit. So we use a system called no dig. So we haven't motivated the soil, we,  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:03:58):**  what we do is we put quite a lot of compost, and then we grow into that. And then the idea  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:02):**  is that worms will kind of take it in. So the beds are slightly raised, but not by too  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:07):**  much. And that's primarily to just try and get organic matter back into the soil. And  
**[0:04:11-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:11):**  we have two polytunnels at the moment, but they're quite, they're quite small on the  
**[0:04:14-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:14):**  grand scheme of things.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:15):**  But those raised beds that you're talking about, they're beds where the soil that's  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:19):**  inside is based on the soil down below. Is that right? Rather than sort of being up on  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:24):**  trestles?  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:25):**  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it's all on the ground. And that's a primary kind of focus of being  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:29):**  organic that you have to grow with the soil. And so nothing's above ground.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:33):**  And on Instagram, you have quite a lot of pictures. And there's a lot of diversity within  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:38):**  that four and a half acres that you have. I saw a fantastic pond that you developed  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:42):**  there for nature this morning as well. There's a lot going on.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:46):**  We've tried to create, I guess, lots of different hubs within the farm. We've put down a woodland,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:50):**  which we won't get anything from that for a while, but an acre and a half of it is down  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:54):**  to woodland. We've put in new hedgerows, there's ponds as well. And it's all about creating  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:04:58):**  different environments that one, we can then go and grow different crops in at different  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:02):**  times in the future. So like mushrooms in the woodland, we can grow kind of wet loving  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:07):**  plants in the pond areas, all with the idea of kind of creating more kind of wildlife  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:12):**  spots throughout the farm. That's a real basis of how we manage kind of our ecosystem is  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:17):**  bringing back the things that aren't really there anymore.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:20):**  And who are your main customers?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:21):**  So mostly restaurants, obviously, Covis has been a bit of a challenge to that. Our main  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:27):**  business, so we used to do this back in London, was to sell to a restaurant in London. We  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:31):**  were going to try and create a new market down here. We're quite close to Brighton and  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:35):**  Brighton has quite a similar food scene to London as well. This year we moved online.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:40):**  We were pushed to because everything was shut and we didn't have enough kind of space and  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:44):**  cultivation to be able to sell into existing veg boxes or wholesalers. So yeah, we started  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:50):**  posting flowers in the post.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:52):**  You talk about, you know, sort of selling into restaurants directly. And I think that's  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:55):**  different to anybody else that we've spoken to within this series. Have you just sort  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:05:59):**  of trampled the streets of London and beaten the doors of chefs or how have you managed  
**[0:06:05-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:05):**  to build up that side of your sort of customer base?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:07):**  Yeah, I mean, it was a little bit like that. It was kind of going in being a bit crass,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:12):**  I guess, with a massive box of flowers and veg and then just going into restaurants.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:16):**  Hey, look at all of this fabulous produce that we grow. Do you want it? That's kind  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:21):**  of what we did maybe like three years ago. I think I was a bit braver back then just  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:25):**  marching into places. A lot of it's also from Instagram. Lots of chefs are on Instagram.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:29):**  Lots of restaurants are on Instagram as well. So us kind of showing the really kind of colourful  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:35):**  unusual veg that they often can't get a hold of. People started getting in touch with us  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:39):**  from that. So yeah, it kind of grew quite organically.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:42):**  The importance of social media, particularly for smaller independent growers. Joe, you  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:48):**  grow a serious volume of carrots and potatoes and onions. Who are your customers?  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:53):**  So we supply into the retail industry, if you like, in the UK. We also supply to the  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:06:59):**  wholesale marketplace down in London. And we also export as and when required if we've  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:05):**  got surplus as a crop and the market's not overly buoyant in the UK.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:09):**  So do you find yourself putting some veggies in boxes and knocking on Mr Waitrose's door,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:14):**  that sort of thing?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:15):**  Yeah, I mean, from time to time, we certainly do. When we're looking at, you know, I would  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:19):**  class it as MPD or added value products. So, you know, if we were looking at coloured carrots  
**[0:07:23-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:23):**  or Chantenay carrots or something that's a little bit outside the ordinary, you know,  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:27):**  different coloured potatoes with different textures and tastes and agronomic reasons  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:31):**  for growing, then we often get told we should be camping in our customers' foyers and, you  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:37):**  know, making sure that we've shown them our ideas. So yeah, we're certainly not averse  
**[0:07:41-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:41):**  to doing that.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:42):**  And if we wanted to go and buy some of your root vegetables, I take it that you're pretty  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:47):**  much in every one of the big five retailers in the UK?  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:51):**  So I haven't gone into the details of the grower group that we've passed off, but we're  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:07:56):**  one of five other growers in the UK that form a grower group called the British Organic  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:02):**  Carrot Growers Group. Collectively, we make up probably 90% of any organic carrot bought  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:08):**  in the UK. So I'd like to say yes, you could pick up our carrots at a given time of the  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:13):**  year in most retail shops, but they may not have come directly from ourselves. They could  
**[0:08:17-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:17):**  have come from someone else in that grower group.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:19):**  World Finance, with your... I mean, if you've got 1,000 acres, and a little bit of it's  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:24):**  unproductive, you can stick a bit of it out to woodland. Perhaps it's not quite so important.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:29):**  With four and a half acres, every square metre you have counts in terms of making your farm  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:33):**  pay. Do you find that profit and ecology create competing demands for you?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:38):**  I don't personally, no. I think the two have to go hand in hand. I think you can have one  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:43):**  without the other. Not long term, and we're here for the long run. We've got a 150 year  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:48):**  lease. We have to think about the long term here. So we could go and make loads of money  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:53):**  really quickly, we could cultivate the whole space, we could get started, but that's not  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:08:57):**  going to help us in the long run. There's a lot of other issues that we have to fix  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:01):**  here. This land is really susceptible to flooding. On the flip side, it's also really susceptible  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:06):**  to droughts. It has quite an unusual microclimate, and we're quite low-lying from the south down.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:11):**  So we need to be doing stuff to make sure that we can use this land to create a profit  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:16):**  and to bring in finance. There are spaces where we've put in a woodland, so at the back  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:21):**  where a lot of the water that comes into us. People might think that an acre and a half  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:26):**  of woodland on this space is actually quite a lot, but that's coppicing material. There's  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:31):**  100 walnuts in there, so that's nut trees. There's 200 hazelnuts, so that's hazelnut  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:35):**  trees in the future. A lot of those trees are made up of foraging trees, so a lot of  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:40):**  the work that we do, or we used to do, was a lot of foraging work for chefs and restaurants.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:44):**  So we've been able to build in different things that will come into production and  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:48):**  come into a revenue stream down the line, but also have the benefit of creating wildlife  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:54):**  spots for us, helping with soil compaction that we've got here, helping with lots of  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:09:58):**  different things, but ultimately always being able to feed into key revenue streams and  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:03):**  adding new products. You talked about the land being prone to flooding. I mean, presumably,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:09):**  you can't just instantly change from veg and nasturtiums to watercress. So how do you  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:14):**  handle that sort of thing? At the moment, it's, so this is our first season here. So  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:19):**  this winter is really where we're getting an idea of how the water flows, where the  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:23):**  pockets are, where we're getting pooling. So in some of those spaces, we've been like,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:27):**  okay, there's loads of water pooling there. It probably wants to be a pond. Let's make  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:30):**  it a pond. And we can use that as a water storage space. So then, say, like irrigating  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:36):**  our crops in the polytunnel or using it for kind of irrigation in the summer as well.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:40):**  So it's, it's kind of just, I guess, listening to some of those spots and being like, okay,  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:44):**  that's probably not going to be an area that we can grow much in. And also looking at plants  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:48):**  that like wet spaces. So things like meadowsweet, we can harvest those for edible flowers too.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:53):**  It's just looking at what type of plants can we use to go into those areas that maybe we  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:10:58):**  can't get profit from in a vegetable, but that's fine because there's other stuff that  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:02):**  we can put there. It's really interesting listening to you talking, because it sounds  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:05):**  like, you know, on a small scale, when we think about the proportions of woodland or  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:10):**  ponds or what you're doing with the land there, it's actually not dissimilar to the  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:15):**  proportions that people like George in previous podcasts have talked about, you know, with  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:20):**  their, their larger spaces. So it's, it's really interesting. It's a microcosm. Now,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:24):**  Joe, you're both Soil Association Organic certified. For you, Joe, how important is  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:29):**  that certification to your customers?  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:31):**  Oh, well, it's hugely important, actually. So obviously, we've come on stage to talk  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:35):**  about agroecology. And I think, you know, I want to be really clear that we're, we're  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:40):**  organic, and agroecology sort of fits part of that. We're obviously certified, which  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:46):**  means we have to go through quite a vigorous inspection on a yearly annual basis. And that  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:51):**  means, you know, there's a whole ream of standards that we must achieve every year.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:11:56):**  And to be honest, I guess they do become more of just a way of daily life, if you like,  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:01):**  we sort of become so used to those principles, those standards, they're just kind of normal  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:05):**  to us now. But in terms of the benefit, then to our customers into the marketplace is that  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:10):**  they know without question, they can trust us and what they're buying is truly organic.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:15):**  And that, you know, the principles of the Soil Association set are what I would class  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:20):**  as a sort of gold standard. So I think that's really important. And obviously, there is  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:25):**  a difference in terms of, generally there's a difference in the cost of organic produce  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:30):**  when you're picking that up. But you know, I want people to be fully bought into the  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:34):**  principles behind what we do and why we do it. And therefore, you know, you're paying  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:38):**  for sustainability and environmentally friendly farming. And it's got a guarantee on it,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:43):**  essentially. So it's a sort of brand, it's the transparency and accountability. And Sinead,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:48):**  you're also there, you're paid up, organic certified. For a smaller business, that's,  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:53):**  you know, it's a lot of money and a lot of paperwork. Why is the certification so important  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:12:57):**  to you? Yeah, I mean, I completely agree with what Joe said. I think for us, we kind of see  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:03):**  it as like, it's really important for us to support the things that we believe in, not  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:08):**  only in terms of growing, but also like at a policy level and public engagement level.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:12):**  We kind of see the Soil Association as like doing that work for us. So this is our contribution  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:17):**  towards that. You know, I think our food system is at a really pivotal point right now. And  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:21):**  a lot of things are changing. We're seeing a lot of changes already. And for us personally,  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:26):**  transparency and accountability are really, really important to our business and to how we think the  
**[0:13:32-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:32):**  food system should move forward. Becoming a Soil Association organic certified farm was the kind  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:37):**  of way for us to feel like we were actively a part of that and not just putting words to things and  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:43):**  not actions. It is a cost that, you know, hopefully we'll sell enough flowers and veg to cover it and  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:48):**  it will be okay. Joe, as an organic producer, you're not using pesticides or insecticides.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:13:54):**  What do you do instead on your, you know, your big fields of veg to manage pests and keep up the  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:01):**  yields that you need? Well, I don't know how long you've got, but we're doing quite a few different  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:07):**  things actually. Fundamentally, I think the kind of principles of organic farming for me are  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:12):**  prevention is better than cure. So, you know, we're in a position now where technology and  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:17):**  science and data to move on to such a stage that having access to that allows us to make better  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:23):**  decisions first and foremost. I think if you then start to look at the fact that yes, we can't use  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:27):**  artificial chemicals and fertilizers and such like it, it then becomes very important in terms of  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:32):**  where your farms are, the type of rotations they have. So looking at things like soil health and  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:38):**  biodiversity and also looking at the wider environment. So, you know, one of the things  
**[0:14:43-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:43):**  that we've really worked hard on with the farms and the estate teams is having sort of beneficial  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:50):**  insect habitats around the farm where, you know, we're not going into a field that's completely  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:14:56):**  sort of barren and everything's been killed. There is actually quite a good balance of insects,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:01):**  if you like, around and such like. So, you know, that's been really critical finding good resilient  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:07):**  farming systems, if you like, that have got these things built into them. Over and above that,  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:13):**  in terms of what we can actively do ourselves, we've started moving back towards having smaller  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:19):**  plots within a field. So, you know, if we've got a 25 acre field of carrots, we'll split that into  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:24):**  maybe four or five sections and we'll try and establish flower sort of borders or equivalent  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:30):**  of what an old beetle bank may have once been sort of seen as. And again, we'll try and encourage  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:36):**  insects to get right down into the field. And we've actually gone through a process over the  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:40):**  last three or four years of bringing in insects and actually releasing them into the field with  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:46):**  that mindset that when pests come in, obviously the pressure builds up over time and then the  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:53):**  beneficials will come in at a later stage and sort of naturally build up after them. So, we're,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:15:57):**  if you like, trying to reverse that and get the population of beneficials to such a level that  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:02):**  when pests come in, they're kind of ready and fit to fight them off. So, to kind of summarise those  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:08):**  things to an extent, you're talking about, you know, using technology and data, changing and  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:13):**  being really careful with the rotation, building up the soil health and the biodiversity there so  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:17):**  that everything is healthier, which sort of contributes to that sort of additional resilience.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:22):**  And it's interesting because we often mention the word diversity on this podcast. And recently  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:27):**  somebody said, well, you know, you can have, if you go to the zoo, the zoo is diverse, but what it  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:32):**  isn't is connected. And so, what you're talking about is trying to build that connectivity between  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:38):**  everything that's living so that nature manages itself to a better extent.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:42):**  Absolutely. I think a really good way to put that across in layman's terms, you know, if you imagine  
**[0:16:48-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:48):**  a human being, when you're not particularly healthy, you might, you know, you've got  
**[0:16:54-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:16:54):**  different gut bacteria, you're unhealthy, you're more likely to pick up an illness. If you're  
**[0:17:00-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:00):**  fighting fit, you're much more likely to be able to fight off illness. And I see soil is exactly  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:06):**  the same. I see rotation exactly the same. If you've got a good fit, healthy soil with living  
**[0:17:11-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:11):**  organisms, they're able to look after themselves. And we very rarely touch wood to see disease in  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:17):**  our veg crops. Whereas I know in non-organic systems where chemicals have come in and just  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:22):**  killed everything and almost made it a barren wasteland, if you like, they're getting disease  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:26):**  after disease after disease, because it's the first thing that comes back. The bad insect is  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:30):**  the first one that comes back. You know, it's that type of mindset that we're trying to kind of get  
**[0:17:35-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:35):**  away from.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:35):**  Sinead, is that kind of the same thing that you do on your space?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:40):**  Yeah, absolutely. It's, you know, it's all about creating balance throughout the entire year. And  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:44):**  I think we're quite fortunate that first and foremost, we are a flower farm. So, those are  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:49):**  the things that a lot of our insects and wildlife eat. So, having an abundance of that across the  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:54):**  farm attracts a lot of kind of beneficial insects into our operation. And that was the first thing  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:17:59):**  that we did last year. Like last year was quite a write off for us. But we like the first thing we  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:04):**  have to do is plant loads of flowers everywhere so that we can start enticing the insects in and let  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:09):**  them know that we're here and there's lots of food for them. And you know, it's the same as, you  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:13):**  know, creating like those small ponds, we've seen toads in those, we've left our grasses really long,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:18):**  we've seen grass snakes in those. We let a lot of our grasses kind of go to seed or a lot of our  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:22):**  plants go to seed. Those are really good for bringing in birds. So, it's yeah, a lot of stuff  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:27):**  that we do is all driven by wildlife and how do we create balance within the system.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:31):**  Now, you mentioned COVID earlier on Sinead. And you've been on, I think, quite a decent personal  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:38):**  journey during the whole COVID pandemic. Because you were saying before that your sort of key  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:43):**  customer base was chefs, people stopped going to restaurants. And so you've turned to online  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:49):**  retail. Have you been able to make that shift okay? Have you been able to find the online  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:18:54):**  customers? I think we got started a bit late. So, I mean, we were quite unfortunate in that we moved  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:00):**  to this site two days before lockdown happened. And that pretty much just wrote off everything.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:05):**  But it also meant that a water connection that we were supposed to get here didn't happen. So,  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:09):**  we only had our water connected last month. So, it meant that we couldn't really do a lot. We were  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:14):**  able to do sunflowers, but we just we didn't really have enough quantity to really make it  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:19):**  work very well. But it was enough to kind of just like keep us going and to let us know that okay,  
**[0:19:25-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:25):**  when we're operational next year, and we have more space, and we have water, we will be okay.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:30):**  It has been hard. And that switch has been, it was something that we weren't really kind of prepared  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:34):**  for. It wasn't really something we wanted to do. And we were kind of pushed towards it. But it has  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:39):**  been, it has been okay. And there were sort of other issues that perhaps, you know, people  
**[0:19:43-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:43):**  wouldn't instantly think about that seem to have been causing you quite a lot of angst. You know,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:47):**  I've seen some of your posts on Instagram where you're talking about packaging and the use of  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:52):**  plastic in the online business. Do you think this is something that you can solve mentally  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:19:57):**  and ethically as well as physically? I'm not entirely sure. I think we've, we were kind of  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:02):**  pushed to go online, which then means, you know, we have to use plastic punnets, we have to use  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:06):**  plastic ice packs, and then we stick them into a box. And then we like stuff the boxes with lots  
**[0:20:10-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:10):**  of wood shavings to just so they don't get damaged. That's a lot of packaging. And for us to  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:15):**  kind of sit on our soapbox talking about the environment. There's just a lot of hypocrisy in  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:20):**  it. And I think that's something that we wanted to put our hands up and say, you know, we're not  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:23):**  ignoring this issue. We are fully aware, we feel guilty, we feel responsible, and we do need to do  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:29):**  better. I think a huge part of the issue is that there's just nothing available for the organic  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:34):**  grower. There's stuff that you can use called the gas fee, which is like kind of cardboard  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:38):**  pulp punnets, but they're all growing with GM corn, so you can't use them as an organic grower.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:43):**  And I've emailed them so many times just being like, please, will you do something? There's  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:46):**  people that want this stuff. But it's, I mean, I'm one person that's quite insignificant to these  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:50):**  large companies. So it's not going to happen. I think I think we've just decided that we're going  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:54):**  to put our foot down with ourselves about it, that we'll do the fresh flowers this year, just to kind  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:20:59):**  of help us get out of the situation that we're in right now. But going forward, we'll only do it as  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:04):**  like a local or into restaurant, and then our online stuff will be dried flowers.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:08):**  Paul That's what I was going to say,  
**[0:21:09-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:09):**  you were sort of moving into the dried flower element.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:11):**  Anna Yeah, absolutely. And that was always our plan.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:14):**  It was our plan to kind of, in terms of the public facing stuff that we wanted to do,  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:17):**  we wanted to do something that had like a longer shelf life that we could use better packaging,  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:22):**  like tin or glass that can be reused. Yeah, I think it's just going back to that and not being  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:27):**  strayed by like, okay, well, there's a bit of easy money here, we could continue going down that and  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:31):**  then we could end up getting stuck in a bit of a trap of not being able to get out of that. So I  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:35):**  think we've just kind of had to put our foot down with ourselves, just so we feel like we can sleep  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:40):**  a bit better at night. Paul  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:41):**  And Joe, as Managing Director at RB Organic, you're responsible for the packing as well as the growing  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:46):**  what sort of sustainability challenges do you face in terms of the packaging?  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:49):**  Paul Yeah, so similar sort of issues really, we're hugely aware of the environmental impact and you  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:21:57):**  know, the blue planet last year or the year before now, you know, I think that's really raised the  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:02):**  awareness for a wide range of people. I think we take a slightly different stance in that,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:07):**  you know, for us plastic is almost a necessary evil because, you know, there is an element with  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:12):**  our products that if you take away plastic at this stage, then the waste percentage goes up because  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:17):**  it does actually serve a purpose for kind of preserving, you know, the products. I think the  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:22):**  other thing is that, like with everything, whilst plastic isn't the best, it's also not necessarily  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:28):**  or rather, there's not necessarily a suitable alternative out there. We talk about paper and  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:34):**  cardboard and other options. Well, you know, they come at a cost financially and they also come at  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:40):**  a cost environmentally and I don't think we truly understand what that actually is. You know, we're  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:45):**  sort of doing lots of work at the moment looking at different alternative options. Our customers  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:51):**  are doing the same and, you know, there's lots of work going on in the background to see, you know,  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:22:55):**  what sort of suitable alternatives are out there. But I don't think it's going to be a quick fix by  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:00):**  any means. Where's the pressure coming from though, Joe? Is the pressure coming, you know,  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:05):**  is it pressure that you're putting on yourself because of your interest in packaging and being  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:09):**  more sustainable or is that pressure coming from your customers directly? It's both, to be honest,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:14):**  is absolutely both. I think we ourselves have, you know, we're constantly looking at it because  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:19):**  packaging is not cheap. So we're always looking at reducing the microns. In actual fact, the plastic  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:26):**  that we put all our products in at the moment is what we call LDPE, which means that in theory,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:32):**  it's all recyclable. But unfortunately, there's very few county councils around the country that  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:36):**  can actually deal with that type of plastic. They don't have the facilities to actually recycle it.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:40):**  So that in itself, you know, could be part of the solution if the government was actually  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:45):**  put some money into facilities that could deal with these things. And certainly as a business,  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:49):**  I think, yeah, our sort of principles at heart would certainly shy us away from plastics in the  
**[0:23:55-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:55):**  future if there was a suitable alternative. But what I don't want to do is go down the road of  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:23:59):**  something that's worse or get to a stage where people are wasting produce because it's going  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:04):**  off in the fridge. It's interesting, you're talking about the complexity of this issue.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:09):**  And you're right, you know, the life cycles, the life systems of all these different options,  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:14):**  you know, we do need to understand them better. You've also talked about data and using data on  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:19):**  your farm. You're clearly quite invested in the detail in terms of a whole range of different  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:24):**  processes. And I wonder what role technology plays for you more generally on the farm.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:29):**  Yeah, one of the benefits to scale is supposedly efficiency. Whether that's entirely true,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:35):**  I would challenge because I think attention to detail can never be beaten and attention to detail  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:41):**  requires people on the ground doing the job hands on, quite frankly. But I think, yeah, technology  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:47):**  in the broader sense has certainly allowed us to make quicker, better decisions because we're,  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:53):**  you know, we've just got it at hands as and when you need it. I think if you look back over the  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:24:58):**  last 10 years, we've gone away from a paper-based system. You know, we've moved to tractors having  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:04):**  GPS and RTK, which makes them far more accurate and efficient. You know, the guys have all got  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:09):**  iPads now. So, you know, any work that's done on the farm is automatically just transferred onto  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:15):**  computer systems. So, we're recording everything that we do in quite a joined up fashion, if you  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:20):**  like. And, you know, from a financial perspective, again, I think making good, quick decisions has  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:27):**  been so key. It's an interesting balance, isn't it? You have GPS and you were talking about that  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:31):**  25-acre field of carrots where you split it up into three or four different sections with  
**[0:25:37-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:37):**  flour margins in the middle. And I'm kind of getting a picture of even hedgerows being able  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:42):**  to go back there in due course because you might have tractors that are driverless, electric,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:49):**  they're quiet, they're working through the night on a GPS, they don't need the daylight. Can you  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:53):**  see a future where that's happening? A hundred percent. And I think we're all already a long  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:25:58):**  way down that road, to be honest. I mean, I've not touched on some of the schemes that we're  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:04):**  part of at the moment, but we're certainly looking at electric vehicles, robotic wheeling machines.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:10):**  You know, we already use lots of different soil moisture probes, which are all put out in the  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:15):**  fields and they connect to satellite dishes and then back to the office. So, yeah, I mean,  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:20):**  you know, even to the extent now where when a tractor stops in the field, we get a text on the  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:25):**  phone and it says that tractor stopped, but you know, here's a load of information. This is what  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:29):**  time it started, this is what diesel it's been using, so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think we're  
**[0:26:34-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:34):**  a long way down that road already. So, you're clearly crunching a lot of data and, you know,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:38):**  there's lots of information coming from those probes and so on, as you were saying. Do you  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:42):**  think that those probes and the data that's coming back from, you know, from inside the field is ever  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:48):**  going to be entirely able to replace those more traditional instincts of human beings, you know,  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:54):**  for what the weather's going to do or when to take in the harvest? Is there going to be an algorithm  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:26:58):**  that says this is what you need to do today? Interesting question, because we were having this  
**[0:27:03-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:03):**  debate this morning with an angry tech scientist, I think was his title, but he was almost saying  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:10):**  yes and no to the same question. Yes, a lot of what people do will be replaced, there's no two  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:16):**  ways about it and I think it will only make us better in terms of the output, but equally,  
**[0:27:21-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:21):**  I'm sorry to say there's no substitute for taking Spain and sticking it in the ground and having to  
**[0:27:26-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:26):**  look and, you know, grabbing hold of the soil in their own two hands. You just can't substitute  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:31):**  that, I don't think. I sense in you that there is, you know, at the same time as you say that,  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:37):**  you're clearly really interested in the tech and, you know, sort of keeping an eye on it.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:41):**  Is there a robot that you'd really like to have for the farm but isn't yet in development?  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:46):**  The single biggest cost to our business at the moment is hand weeding. So, we bring in,  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:52):**  in sort of June, July for about six to eight weeks, anywhere up to about 100 people and  
**[0:27:58-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:27:58):**  their sole purpose in life for that period of time is to pick weeds. So, I think if we could  
**[0:28:04-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:04):**  find something that means we don't need that cost and the hassle quite frankly, then that would be  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:10):**  the ultimate for us. You talk about, you know, people coming in, their sole purpose is weeding.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:17):**  You know, one of the things that we often hear about is that finding local people to do that  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:21):**  can be quite a challenge. Are you reliant on people, you know, coming over from Europe to  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:26):**  do that in the season? Is Brexit going to affect you in that way? I don't know yet, is the honest  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:30):**  answer. We're very fortunate because here in Western Norfolk, we're very close to quite a few  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:36):**  big towns. So, Kingsland is not too far away, about 10 miles away. And obviously, you know,  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:42):**  there's a very rural agricultural area. So, there's quite a few other different types of farms,  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:48):**  but they all use a degree of labour. So, it would be wrong to say that these are local English-born  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:28:55):**  people, but we generally have a good source of labour. And there may be second or even third  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:01):**  generation, possibly Lithuanian, Polish backgrounds. But to me, I still class them as local  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:07):**  because as I say, if they're second or third generation, then they're living in the local  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:11):**  towns and have been for quite some time. So, it's not been an issue for us yet. But that's not to  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:17):**  say it won't be in the future because frankly, people don't want to be outside when it's raining  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:22):**  and cold and work in long hours, you know. They'd sooner be inside and wrapped up warm.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:27):**  Sianaid, I imagine there's lots of rain and cold on your farm at the moment. Does technology help  
**[0:29:33-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:33):**  you with that? Do you use technology on your farm as well?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:36):**  Sianaid Bhandari We're quite basic. I think the most high-tech  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:40):**  thing I have here is a drill and a wheelbarrow. Yeah, it's quite a back-to-basic setup. I mean,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:46):**  part of that's just money. Like, we can't afford much else other than just eating a lot of food  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:51):**  to keep our arms going and lifting things. But yeah, I think in terms of the tech that we do use,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:29:57):**  it probably comes down to data, you know, tracking information in terms of the sales that we do and  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:04):**  the kind of revenue streams. A lot of the plants that we grow have several different outlets and  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:08):**  identify what outlet's the best. But yeah, I think really it's kind of like tech for admin that we  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:13):**  use and not really any tech to do what we're doing.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:16):**  World Finance, what do you think about the way in which some of the things that you grow – the salad leaves and  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:22):**  the edible flowers – there are people using old factories and underground stations, old tube  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:28):**  tunnels in London and other cities. What do you think about the way that hydroponics are being  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:33):**  used in urban farms? Sianaid Bhandari It's a tough one. I don't  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:36):**  want to come off as dismissive, and this is something I've been kind of wrestling with and  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:40):**  thinking. But yeah, I grow in soil, I advocate for soil health, I advocate for wildlife and the role  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:46):**  of wildlife within our lives and our farms. The access to nature for its wellbeing purposes,  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:52):**  and you just don't get that with those systems. I think that aside, I think we're yet to kind of see  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:30:57):**  one of those systems that works economically. You see a lot of start-ups, they come and go.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:03):**  And I think there needs to be a question around the kind of environmental side of that. The amount  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:08):**  of materials that are used from the plastics, the trays that are being used to grow in, to the racks  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:14):**  that are being used, to the lights that are replicating the sun, to the things that are  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:18):**  generating heat. There's a lot of material involved in those set-ups, whereas I guess in my  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:23):**  set-up, I take a feed and I put it in the ground, Bob's your uncle, we're done. And I think that's  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:28):**  something that's often overlooked in those systems. And I think generally a lot of money  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:32):**  goes into those systems for thinking that they're more sustainable, that they're the future of  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:38):**  everything, but to kind of replicate one, what the sun does for us, and two, what clouds do for us in  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:44):**  watering and what the soil does for us in terms of providing nutrients, it just seems like a bit  
**[0:31:50-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:50):**  misplaced. Actually that money could really go towards doing a lot of the stuff that Joe's talked  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:31:54):**  about in terms of increasing efficiency and going into research for actual farms to become more  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:01):**  productive or to streamline things more. Yeah, I personally feel like it's a bit misplaced,  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:07):**  that kind of faith in those systems.  
**[0:32:09-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:09):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:32:08-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:08):**  Chief Executive Officer,  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:17):**  Defra,  
**[0:32:18-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:18):**  Why do you think that is?  
**[0:32:48-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:32:48):**  Why does it matter?  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:18):**  I think often if you have the same people using the same methods on the same kind of scale,  
**[0:33:23-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:23):**  often talking about things, where can progress come into that sometimes? And I think sometimes  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:28):**  having an outlier and having someone that's doing things a little bit differently at a different  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:32):**  scale can bring in a different way of thinking and also, you know, challenge some of the thoughts  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:37):**  that might go around in those circles. And likewise, the other way too, I think it's  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:41):**  important that those conversations are had because ultimately we're all trying to progress to the  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:45):**  same thing, but we have to work together and we can't just ignore a section of food producers  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:50):**  that are bringing food to the plate for lots of people.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:53):**  Absolutely. And I can see entirely why it would be important for Defra to listen to you and to  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:33:59):**  other people working at the scale that you are. Do you think that there's a difference that Defra  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:03):**  ought to be making for you and your business? I think in terms of making our lives easier,  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:08):**  is one having us a part of the conversation. So I am not entitled to any support whatsoever.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:13):**  But I, out of my own money, have planted an acre and a half of woodland, 500 meters of hedgerow,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:19):**  200 meters of shelterbelt, which will benefit the wider area. We're here surrounded by lots of  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:25):**  other larger arable fields. What we're doing here will indirectly benefit other farms. And I think  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:30):**  that should be recognized in terms of, you know, small clusters of farms that are growing different  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:35):**  types of things and a big diversity of crops, like the wider benefits that can have to other systems  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:39):**  and other people nearby. And yeah, I think, you know, some of that financial help would be nice.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:44):**  And even just help in terms of access to information or access to capital, etc. It's not  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:50):**  fair that a lot of people get ignored. And I think it's an accessibility issue as well. You know, I'm  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:54):**  not from a farming background. I'm from a city. My only option into farming is to do it kind of small  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:34:59):**  scale. There's a lot of people in that space too that are unsupported at the moment. Now I'm 48,  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:04):**  and we've been having this conversation for a very long time. Do you feel that there should be  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:09):**  some kind of central plan driven by government delivered much more substantially by local  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:15):**  authorities in order to make sure that there are those sorts of spaces in every community?  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:20):**  Yeah, absolutely. You know, I think small farms and like farms in general, way back before they  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:26):**  were like a real, like a central bedrock of a community. They were the thing that brought  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:30):**  people together. There's nothing that can bring people together like food can. And I think we're  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:34):**  particularly living in like quite a polarizing time at the moment. And if there's one way you can  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:38):**  bring people together, it's to bring people together through food and a sense of community.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:42):**  So I do think it's really important. And I think there's a huge role in terms of addressing lots of  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:47):**  issues around food insecurity and access to nature for people that maybe don't necessarily get out  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:52):**  into green spaces very often. There's so many other things that farms could contribute into,  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:35:57):**  and it just needs a joined up effort rather than lots of isolated silos that aren't really,  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:03):**  you know, talking to one another. Joe, do you engage with the public at all?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:07):**  Yeah, we do. I think before I answer that question, I'd just like to back up what  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:12):**  Shanno was saying there. I'd love to know if anybody in Defra even knew what five hectares  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:17):**  look like. I think it's absolutely shocking that they don't recognize it. And they talk all the  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:22):**  time about public goods for, you know, for the public. And to me, what Shanno has just described  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:28):**  there is exactly that. So, you know, the days of giving people support because they own land  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:34):**  should be long gone. You know, it should be because you're doing something that's beneficial  
**[0:36:38-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:38):**  to you and the community that you serve, if you like. But in terms of dealing with the sort of  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:45):**  the consumer base, we host no end to different visits throughout the season. We take part in  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:50):**  leaf open farm Sunday. And like Shanno, we do lots of different videos online and, you know,  
**[0:36:56-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:36:56):**  we're constantly communicating where we can, the message as to what we do. And yeah, I think we  
**[0:37:02-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:02):**  actively encourage that. I've always said that if I could get every man, woman and child onto farm  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:07):**  and show them what we do, I'm convinced that I could get them to buy our produce in the shops.  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:12):**  Jason Vale, so we're coming to the end of the program. And I just wonder if there are things  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:15):**  for both of you that you've learned the hard way, you know, that you might do differently if you had  
**[0:37:20-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:20):**  your time again. Joe? Joe  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:32):**  Not big ones, I think. We've on too many occasions thought, yeah, let's go in this direction and  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:37):**  moved everything. And then it's been a disaster. So do things in incremental steps and just take  
**[0:37:42-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:42):**  your time. Yeah. Jason Vale  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:44):**  What about you, Sinead? What's been hardest for you? And what do you wish somebody had  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:48):**  told you early on that you had to find out the hard way?  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:51):**  Sinead Well, one, a global pandemic was going to happen two days before we moved to that. That  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Veg--Horticulture---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-es0cpk#t=0:37:55):**  might have been nice to know. It could have been helpful. It would have been helpful. But no,

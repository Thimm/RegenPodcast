### Farm Gate  (Sun, 13 Jun 2021 19:08:24)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Land Unlocked, a collaboration from the Food Farming and Countryside Commission  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:10):**  and the Farmgate podcast. I'm Fenlow Kustain, the chief executive of Farmwell, and in this  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:15):**  series I'm talking about land use, with influential figures in the UK and around the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:20):**  world in the run-up to COP26 in Glasgow this November. Land is all too often the silent  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:26):**  partner in climate change discussions, and yet the way we manage land and produce and  
**[0:00:31-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:31):**  supply food holds the key to unlocking lasting solutions not only to global warming but also  
**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:38):**  to biodiversity restoration and the fair distribution of good quality, diverse and nutritious meals.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:45):**  In this programme, I'm thrilled to be joined by two truly exceptional people.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:50):**  Christiana Figueres is an internationally recognised leader on global climate change.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:55):**  She was executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:59):**  from 2010 to 2016, the force behind the Paris Agreement. Today she is the co-founder of  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:05):**  Global Optimism and co-host of the podcast Outrage and Optimism. Her new book is called  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:11):**  The Future We Choose â€“ Surviving the Climate Crisis, which she co-authored with Tom Rivett-Carnack.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:17):**  Professor Tim Jackson is an ecological economist, a writer, and he's a commissioner for the  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:22):**  Food, Farming and Countryside Commission. Since 2016, Tim has been director of the Centre  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:27):**  for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity at the University of Surrey. And between 2004  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:33):**  and 2011, Tim was economics commissioner for the UK Sustainable Development Commission,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:38):**  where his work culminated in the groundbreaking book Prosperity Without Growth. Not only that,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:44):**  but he's also written a plethora of award-winning plays for BBC Radio. Welcome both.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:49):**  Hello, Finla. It's wonderful to be here today with you and with Tim, who I can't believe  
**[0:01:57-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:57):**  it, but we haven't met. So this is the first time.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:00):**  It's really strange, isn't it? And Finla, you should probably mention that we both have  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:03):**  the honour of being Hillary laureates, which is awarded by the Hillary Institute in New  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:09):**  Zealand in memory of Edmund Hillary. And Christiana is the latest Hillary laureate, I think. And  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:15):**  I was Hillary laureate five years ago. So it's a pleasure to be here.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:21):**  Wonderful. Well, as I say, welcome to you both. Christiana, I'd like to come to you  
**[0:02:25-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:25):**  first if I may. The Paris Agreement of 2015 is hailed as a global breakthrough in our  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:31):**  united struggle to avert the climate crisis. You led that process as executive secretary  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:37):**  of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Six years on, looking back, was it  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:43):**  the tipping point you hoped for? Well, I'm afraid that on something as complex  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:49):**  as climate change, there is no one tipping point that is actually going to be any sort  
**[0:02:56-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:56):**  of magical solution. I think it is the compounded effect of several tipping points. And I think  
**[0:03:03-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:03):**  we're seeing those compounded effects. Now, the agreement definitely was the start of  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:11):**  a very new approach to the evolution of the global economy. And I have not that it's my  
**[0:03:19-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:19):**  term, but I have now seen several analysis out there calling on the Paris effect. Why  
**[0:03:27-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:27):**  the Paris effect? Because since the agreement, which clearly points out and marks out the  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:35):**  decarbonization rate and scale that needs to occur around the world in order to keep  
**[0:03:41-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:41):**  us safe. Since then, we have seen so much progress, not enough. Let me underline that  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:49):**  three times. But we have seen quite a bit of progress on renewable energy generation,  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:55):**  certainly on finance. And I don't know if you want to talk about that, but quite a shift  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:01):**  in where financing is going, quite a shift in where fossil fuels are going, and quite  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:08):**  a shift in where global transport is going. So all of those areas actually really being  
**[0:04:14-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:14):**  benefited by the Paris effect and into what is increasingly being recognized as exponential  
**[0:04:23-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:23):**  transformations. Big exception here, land use, big exception. That is the Cinderella  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:30):**  at this party because we haven't focused enough on that. And I'm sure we want to go deeper  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:36):**  into that issue here. Absolutely. And of course, land use, there's complexities in there, a  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:41):**  much less linear challenge perhaps than transport and energy. But we'll come to that, as you  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:46):**  say in just a moment. And I'm interested in the way that, looking at the news, I've seen  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:52):**  so many new commitments and new pledges in the run up to Glasgow in November. Was it  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:57):**  like that around the Paris Agreement? Was there this sort of year or six months when  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:02):**  nations were starting to vie together to see who could pledge the most? Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:08):**  That is actually what is prescribed in the Paris Agreement, that every five years, countries  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:12):**  will take a look at what they have done on decarbonising, how much more they can do because  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:18):**  of newly available technologies, how much more they can do because of financial shifts  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:23):**  and policy effect and then come up with their new ambition levels. So what we're seeing  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:28):**  now is basically a repeat performance, hopefully an improved performance of what we saw in  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:35):**  the 12 months leading up to the Paris Agreement, where all countries came in to register the  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:41):**  first tranche of their emission reduction commitments. And now we're seeing them coming  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:47):**  forward with the second tranche of their emission reduction commitments as prescribed by Paris.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:53):**  This will happen every five years. This time it's a little bit strange. It's a six year  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:57):**  period because of COVID, but we will see this happen every five years.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:01):**  Now, we're going to come on to land use, but at the same time, before we do that, I want  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:05):**  to think about the story of change. And both of you have really interesting experiences  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:10):**  in this area. Christiana, you recently founded Global Optimism. Optimism is a fantastic word  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:17):**  and so often in terms of climate change and other global crises that we face, optimism  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:22):**  seems to be in short supply. And you've characterised optimism not as a sunny day attitude, but  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:27):**  as a gritty and relentless pursuit. What makes you optimistic?  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:32):**  My choice. It's because we have to choose. Either we give in to the doom and gloom and  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:38):**  the helplessness and disappear into a dark room on the couch and cry and be miserable  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:45):**  and despair forever, or we recognise the destruction that we have wrought on this planet. And because  
**[0:06:53-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:53):**  of that, we stand up tall and strong and say because we have wrought the destruction, that  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:00):**  is why we now have the responsibility and actually we have the ingenuity and the capital  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:05):**  and the technology to do something about it and to be able to address climate change in  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:11):**  a timely fashion. So it's a choice. Do you want to give in to helplessness or do you  
**[0:07:17-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:17):**  actually want to be much more optimistic in the sense of rallying everything you can to  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:25):**  be part of the solution? It's a simple choice. Are you part of the problem or do you want  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:31):**  to be part of the solution? And that is a choice, Vinlal, that I think we have to make  
**[0:07:35-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:35):**  every single day.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:36):**  Tim, do you see yourself as an optimistic person?  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:38):**  Yeah, I kind of go along with that. It reminds me of Italian philosopher Gramsci who talks  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:44):**  about pessimism of the intellect, the optimism of the will. And I think that's right. You  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:48):**  know, we can think of all the bad things that there are with the planet, with the situation,  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:52):**  with what we've done to the planet, with the inequality that exists. We can worry about  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:56):**  that and we can and we should take responsibility for it. But actually, as Christiana says,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:02):**  the choice to optimism is always there and it's a profoundly human quality. And it's  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:07):**  one I think that matters to us in this situation. You know, we're in the, if you like, we're  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:11):**  in the kind of final stages of a football match and we're kind of trailing a goal.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:16):**  And if we're the team that gives up at that point because we're too pessimistic, we've  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:19):**  already seen the outcome, then sure enough, we're going to lose. But we do, even in those  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:23):**  circumstances, kind of have a choice to try until the whistle blows. And I think that's  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:28):**  what we should be doing. In a sense, see, people often think of optimism and hope as  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:32):**  being the antidote to despair. But I think actually the antidote to despair is action  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:38):**  and action is always possible. And that's, as Christiana says, is a choice that we can  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:42):**  all make.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:43):**  So optimism is part of the story, but just, you know, sort of thinking a bit more about  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:47):**  your background, you're a true descendant of the Renaissance here, a thinker, professor,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:52):**  a writer in the field of ecological economics, but also a prolific playwright. And it's that  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:57):**  last that I want to come to first here. As human beings, we were storytellers long before  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:03):**  we invented the wheel. Stories help us, you know, as we've just been discussing, to make  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:08):**  sense of the world. And I wonder how important narrative is in addressing the crises that  
**[0:09:13-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:13):**  we face today in nature.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:15):**  I think it is important. It's stories that connect people. It's stories that people can  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:19):**  relate to. It's stories that make us see how the world is working and don't speak just  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:24):**  to fact, but to relationship and to meaning. And I think, you know, in a sense, we've kind  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:29):**  of given into a very simple story that also turns out, as it happens, to be completely  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:34):**  wrong, which is that the human species is kind of is a greedy, selfish, hedonistic species  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:40):**  that is only cruel to each other and wants only to pursue its own ends to whatever destructive  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:47):**  final conclusion that may lead. And we've also been told a story that that's a good  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:51):**  thing, that that's what keeps us working together. That's what keeps capitalism going. That's  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:56):**  what makes us, you know, that competition, that competitive element within us is the  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:00):**  thing that produces social good in society. And it's a really, it's a really interesting  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:05):**  story because it's one that you don't really find in the wisdom traditions in religion.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:09):**  You don't really find it in poetry or literature. You don't find it in sociology or psychology.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:14):**  You don't even find it if you ask people on the streets at the end of the day. The place  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:17):**  you find it and where we're absolutely convinced about it is in economics. And it's that kind  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:22):**  of, it's that story in a sense that's taken over our possibilities and usurped our sense  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:29):**  of what it means to live well and to be well and to be fully flourishing human beings.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:34):**  And it's wrong. So, so yes, the idea of telling a different story, a story more grounded in  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:40):**  reality, a story that offers us the choices that Christiana was talking about, that's  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:45):**  something worth telling.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:46):**  And it's always seemed to me that with economics...  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:48):**  Sorry, can I just end in to underline something really interesting that Tim has mentioned.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:55):**  I'm an anthropologist by training. And so oral history has always been a fascination  
**[0:11:03-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:03):**  to me because we see so many different cultures and societies that over time have relied on  
**[0:11:12-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:12):**  oral history in order to maintain their sense of identity and their sense of the future.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:21):**  And we tend to think rather erroneously that oral history was a tool that was used in the  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:27):**  past by some societies. The fact is we are constantly using oral history. What we're  
**[0:11:34-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:34):**  doing here right now is oral history. It is a very compelling determinant of how we think  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:44):**  about ourselves, who we are, how we turn up in the world. What do we believe in? What  
**[0:11:49-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:49):**  do we believe we are capable of? It is transmitted to us by those with whom we speak or transmitted  
**[0:11:58-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:58):**  to those with whom we are in conversation and in conversation writ large. This is a  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:06):**  conversation. The conversations we have every day, the conversations that we have through  
**[0:12:10-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:10):**  many of our media channels. And so when the bottom line message of all of those stories,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:19):**  all of those conversations is the one that Tim has said that we're actually at best,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:27):**  we are egotistical, short-sighted, non-empathetic humans, and that that's the world that we  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:35):**  inhabit and hence the world that we're going to continue to create. Well, it is then a  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:44):**  self-fulfilling prophecy. And that's why it's so important to be aware of those stories  
**[0:12:50-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:50):**  that we tell, but that start in our mind. What are the stories that we have in our mind  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:57):**  about ourselves and about each other? Because those are the stories that we will then tell,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:02):**  that we will communicate, and those are the stories that we will turn into reality. So  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:07):**  truly standing up to our better selves and to our capacity to be effective agents of  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:13):**  change is very important.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:15):**  And how important is narrative in the diplomatic process? Because I think from the outside,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:19):**  it can seem quite technocratic and remote, but of course, diplomats and politicians,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:24):**  they're human beings the same as anybody else. When you're trying to, well, I hope so. And  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:30):**  when you're trying to corral these people towards a common objective, how important  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:35):**  is that story? Are you having trade-offs between one another? Are you trying to sell a story  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:39):**  to them?  
**[0:13:40-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:40):**  Yes, but there is a mega story there that is an, that acts as an organising principle.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:48):**  And the mega story that helped us to organise or to weave together the countless different  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:54):**  threads that came together in the Paris tapestry, the mega story there was, what kind of a future  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:01):**  do we want to experience? And that was my conversation with almost 195 governments of  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:08):**  the world is, so tell me, what do you want for your people 10 years from now, 20 years  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:13):**  from now, 30 years from now? And the fascinating thing is that when you put your focus at that  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:19):**  time scale, then everybody, of course, is going to tell you what I want is a prosperous  
**[0:14:26-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:26):**  economy that allows everyone to participate, that allows and ensures that everyone is healthy,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:33):**  that everyone has a safe livelihood. And that's a mega story that is shared by everyone who  
**[0:14:39-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:39):**  is a member of the human race. So once you have that mega story established, then you  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:46):**  walk that back and you say, okay, so what does that look like for country X, country  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:52):**  Y, country W? And then you begin to weave those threads together. But it all obeys a  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:59):**  bigger long-term mega story that everyone has actually coincided on.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:05):**  Do you think, Christiana, that's why 1.5 happened in Paris? Because in some sense, 1.5 was a  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:11):**  minor character, a kind of walk-on role for a bit part. It wasn't a major protagonist  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:16):**  as you were going into Paris and yet turned out to be a kind of, you know, this character  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:21):**  who walked on became the main story, in some sense, it's the big story coming out of Paris  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:26):**  because it aligned with that mega narrative that you're talking about.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:31):**  Well, it aligned over time, Tim, right? And as you say, 1.5 as a maximum temperature rise  
**[0:15:38-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:38):**  was sort of smuggled into the text almost in the last minute and was definitely done  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:46):**  on the impulse of the low-lying island states who knew that unless we keep to that a maximum  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:53):**  temperature rise, that their survival was in severe danger. But countries weren't ready  
**[0:15:58-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:58):**  to accept that as a final outcome, as a final ceiling of temperature. So that's why in negotiations  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:07):**  you always try to find middle-of-the-ground text and that middle-of-the-ground ended up  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:12):**  being well below two or striving for 1.5. Since then, as you say, science has advanced  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:18):**  and we now know that there's actually a huge difference between 1.5 and two degrees. We  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:23):**  didn't know that back in 2015. And so, you know, kudos to every single country who really  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:29):**  insisted on that 1.5. They have been proven right.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:33):**  This is fascinating. I could talk for an entire hour on this, but let's move on to land use  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:37):**  for the rest of our time. Now, Tim, your books, Prosperity Without Growth and more recently  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:42):**  Post Growth, contend that our economic model is broken. It's incapable of delivering us  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:48):**  from the climate emergency. Now, I want to challenge that just a little, at least in  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:52):**  terms of food and agriculture. Surely growth is necessary, but it needs to be redefined  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:58):**  away from the corporate profit led model where a small number of people get extremely rich  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:03):**  and towards a stronger, more vibrant countryside where there are new farm and food businesses  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:09):**  supporting a more resilient but growing rural economy in which power has shifted from the  
**[0:17:15-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:15):**  city and back towards the fields.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:16):**  Yeah, it's a very interesting challenge, Finno, because in a sense you've used the word  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:20):**  growth in three very distinct ways there. And in the most obvious way, agriculture is  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:26):**  about growth. It's about growing food and nature knows a lot about growth.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:31):**  Grace is an incredibly important part of the resilience of nature and the cycles of nature.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:37):**  And what's interesting about it, though, is that it's also, you know, that kind of growth  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:41):**  is aligned with decay. It is aligned with cycles. And the decay becomes the part of  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:47):**  the growth in the next cycle. It's a regenerative process. And that regenerative process actually  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:52):**  is a process that agriculture kind of knows very well and knows what the limits of it  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:57):**  are very well. But it's also a process that's gone wrong. You know, it's gone wrong in the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:02):**  sense that in pursuit of growth at the economic level, this almost overriding drive towards  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:08):**  productivity, we put all kinds of chemicals on the land and fertilizers on the land. It's  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:12):**  a very energy intensive process. And that has had the perverse impacts actually of propping  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:17):**  up productivity over the short term and undermining it in the long term so that the quality of  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:22):**  soils actually, not least their inability to absorb carbon in the way that they that  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:27):**  we would like them to be able to do but even worse, perhaps their inability to produce  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:32):**  that same source of food on which we're going to rely on the future indefinitely, because  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:38):**  the farming models, the agricultural models have been pushed and pushed and pushed by  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:42):**  this idea of relentless productivity growth serving actually, not farmers, not land workers,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:48):**  not agriculture itself, and not even really sustainable food, but serving the interests  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:53):**  of the people who are kind of extracting value out of the land in the form of profits for  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:00):**  a minority of people. So it's that, that's the critique, I think that would come out  
**[0:19:05-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:05):**  of prosperity without growth, not that we don't want a thriving rural community. Of  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:11):**  course we do. And you know, for goodness sake, those communities have suffered for decades.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:16):**  So there's very definitely a role for increasing their prosperity, but also aligning that increase  
**[0:19:22-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:22):**  in prosperity with the growth that happens through the cycles of nature in a regenerative  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:29):**  agriculture.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:30):**  So it's a redistribution to an extent of wealth, but certainly of power?  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:34):**  Yes, it is. I mean, you know, the question about about narrative that we were talking  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:39):**  about before is a very interesting one. Who controls the narrative is a question ultimately  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:43):**  of power, which is exactly why it's important to go back to narrative and to change the  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:48):**  narrative and put different narratives on the table. And then the narrative of a regenerative  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:53):**  nature puts different people actually in power, you know, and and it was a lesson from the  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:58):**  pandemic as well, you know, when things went down, it wasn't the financial analysts on  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:02):**  Wall Street that saved our lives. It was the farmers and the nurses and the doctors. And  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:07):**  they were the people who had been in the lowest ranks of power in many ways in society because  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:13):**  of the story, the narrative that we told about what prosperity is. And so, you know, kind  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:18):**  of shifting that around, changing that balance does mean actually giving power to people  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:24):**  who have not had it in the past, whose stories have been excluded from the mainstream narrative  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:30):**  and who are actually the most valuable people in society.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:33):**  Jason Vale, The New York Times. So notoriously, power hungry isn't quite the right phrase,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:38):**  but they like to retain power at the center and devolving power back to individual people.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:43):**  It's very difficult for governments. Do you think they've grown up enough to do that in  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:47):**  the time we have available?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:48):**  I actually have a much more optimistic view of government and what government is. We have  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:53):**  aligned our governments with kind of capitalistic power. We've allowed lobbying into politics  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:58):**  in a way that's undermined the role of democracy and government in the state itself. But actually,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:03):**  it's where government came from. It's not where democracy came from. It's not what democracy  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:09):**  means. It's actually much more aligned with a role that looks after the most vulnerable  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:15):**  in society, that distributes power fairly and equally, that supports those on livelihoods  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:21):**  which might otherwise be skewed or even corrupted by the influences of big power. And this allows  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:29):**  for the conditions under which that distribution can happen. And I believe that is a, you know,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:34):**  that view of government to me goes all the way back to the people who were the architects  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:38):**  of democracy in the philosophy of the of the 16th, 17th, 18th century. And the idea of  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:46):**  a social contract is exactly what gives government the legitimacy to create the conditions so  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:52):**  that the poorest and the most vulnerable, including those who work on the land, have  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:56):**  themselves decent livelihoods.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:58):**  Christiana, I wonder if you could reflect on that. But at the same time, I want to draw  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:02):**  you back to the very beginning of this podcast where we were talking about processes around  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:07):**  climate change and you said, yes, land use was missing. And I wonder why you think that  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:12):**  is.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:13):**  Christiana Davidson I think it's so for several reasons. First,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:18):**  because it is so much more difficult to get your head around land use. It is 30% of the  
**[0:22:26-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:26):**  problem. 30% of emissions come from land use, 70 from the energy side. And if it's 30% of  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:33):**  the problem, then it ought to be 30% of the solution. But typically, it is a much more  
**[0:22:39-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:39):**  distributed sector where the decisions on land use, on agriculture, on forestry are  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:48):**  so much more decentralized than they are in the energy side, where you have basically  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:54):**  a handful of very large energy companies who, if they decide to do the right thing, they  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:00):**  could actually make a huge difference. Land use is very, very different. And it goes all  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:05):**  the way from some agricultural companies that are large, but actually to millions and millions  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:11):**  of small landowners who have been using the land in the same completely unsustainable  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:18):**  and inefficient way for years. And especially when you look at food output, it is just so  
**[0:23:26-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:26):**  inefficient what we're doing. Because when you see how much of the land area in the UK,  
**[0:23:35-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:35):**  48% of all UK land is given over to animal agriculture, basically the same as over the  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:43):**  whole world. One half of our land area is given over to animal agriculture. It's taking  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:49):**  up one quarter of our irrigation water, it's emitting 15% of our greenhouse gas emissions.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:55):**  And it's not really giving us an efficient move from the protein that is in the food  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:03):**  that these animals use to the protein that we consume. So I really want to make a huge  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:08):**  shout out here for plant based diets, because we have to move toward that. Yes, because  
**[0:24:15-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:15):**  of climate change, but also just because of efficiency. It is the most inefficient way  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:21):**  to produce protein is to have, you know, these animals that should be with us for other reasons,  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:27):**  other than for us to eat them. Every single piece of beef that you have on your plate  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:32):**  has lost 97% of the protein contained in the plants that were eaten by that animal. Pork  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:39):**  loses 90%, chicken 80%. It is just such a waste. And frankly, we are at such a point  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:46):**  in breaking through planetary boundaries that we cannot afford to be inefficient. We can't  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:52):**  afford to be inefficient about energy, we can't afford to be inefficient about food,  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:56):**  we can't afford to be inefficient about water, we have to be able to be minutiously efficient  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:02):**  and circular because every single resource that we have, we have to get one, two, three,  
**[0:25:07-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:07):**  four, five times the use out of that resource. So it is time to include land use and everything  
**[0:25:14-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:14):**  that that means, reforestation, protecting of standing lands, move over toward agroecology,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:22):**  move over to plant based diets. It is a huge family of issues. And it's difficult to wrap  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:28):**  your heads around it because each one of those sub chapters has its own barriers. That's  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:34):**  why I think we still haven't moved with the speed that we should on these issues.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:40):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:36):**  But surely we're not talking about stopping eating meat and dairy products altogether  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:45):**  because there's so much of the world, which is grazing land, rough land, or there are  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:49):**  communities in developing countries that are very dependent on the livestock in much drier  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:53):**  areas where, where it's more difficult to grow arable crops or fruit and vegetables.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:59):**  It's about getting the mix right, surely starting from the land and working upwards.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:02):**  Dr. Anneke Vandenbroek,  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:03):**  Well, we're definitely at the wrong side of that extreme, right? Definitely on the wrong  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:08):**  side of that range, because we are just not being efficient at all about the use of land.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:14):**  We are extracting from the land without making it regenerative, without being able to repurpose  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:22):**  and capture back into the soil, the richness that it had originally, we're just extracting.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:29):**  Think of soil as the same way that we extract minerals. That's what we're doing to the soil.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:35):**  We're just extracting, extracting, extracting, then we use very little of what we extract  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:40):**  and then we throw it. Food waste, absolutely just discard. We are not even careful about  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:45):**  our food waste. We do not, we are not recycling food waste back into the soil so that we can  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:52):**  be regenerative about the soil. It is just completely inefficient and irresponsible.  
**[0:26:57-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:57):**  Dr. Mark Walsman,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:58):**  One of the ways in which it's most inefficient is actually that a very heavy meat-based diet  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:03):**  is not conducive to human health. And, you know, we know that in the advanced economies,  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:08):**  we're on the wrong side of that. We know because the World Health Organization tells us that  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:12):**  more people now die from diseases of overconsumption and in particular from things like red meat  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:20):**  and heavy meat-based diets. And we know that actually we could be healthier and have a  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:25):**  more efficient agricultural system at the same time.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:27):**  Dr. Paul Edmondson  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:28):**  I want to come at that question.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:29):**  Dr. Annette Mehr-S  
**[0:27:45-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:45):**  I would say that our view at Food Farming and Countryside  
**[0:28:00-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:00):**  Commission and Farmwell is we need a complete mindset shift if we are going to solve the  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:07):**  climate crisis while at the same time reversing the crisis in biodiversity. When we talk about  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:13):**  high quality nutrition and feeding people well, and then talk about nature, nature gets  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:17):**  split down. There are different conflicting sort of issues. And I think you've touched  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:22):**  on this already, but I still want to ask you quite directly about what the future of land  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:26):**  use looks like to you. Whether it's about food production and a diverse food economy  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:31):**  being at the center of the change that you envision, or whether you think it is essential  
**[0:28:37-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:37):**  to spare off land into different activities so that we end up with forestry here, rewilding  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:43):**  there and then food production intensified into ever smaller parcels.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:47):**  Dr. Annette Mehr-S Well, that depends on whether those parts,  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:50):**  how effective and productive those parcels are going to be. We definitely have to return  
**[0:28:55-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:55):**  a lot of land to reforesting. That is definitely for sure, because otherwise we are creeping  
**[0:29:03-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:03):**  into our biodiversity, our standing biodiversity that is already quite diminished. And so yes,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:11):**  we have to have some land devoted to food production. But again, if that land is primarily  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:17):**  devoted to animal crops, then we're not being efficient with that. Why don't we just go  
**[0:29:23-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:23):**  straight to those crops that give us the most protein and the most efficient use of protein?  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:31):**  So yes, we have to have more land restored. Yes, we have to have richer soil. Yes, we  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:36):**  have to see about us humans having better health and producing our food more efficiently,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:42):**  both from a soil perspective, as well as from a protein intake perspective.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:47):**  Jason Vale So if I think about that in a slightly different  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:50):**  way, with soil health, for example, and biodiversity restoration, sometimes the best ways of achieving  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:56):**  that regeneration in biodiversity is actually with livestock integrated in those systems.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:01):**  And so if we take two different examples, we've got a Sitka spruce plantation, which  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:06):**  is really intensive, doesn't really do an awful lot for biodiversity, can actually exacerbate  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:10):**  flood management problems. And then on the other hand, we have an agroforestry system  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:15):**  where there are livestock integrated, but you've also got trees in that system, and  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:19):**  that pasture managed regeneratively. And then you're drawing down carbon at the same time  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:24):**  as restoring biodiversity and producing food. Is that acceptable in your view?  
**[0:30:29-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:29):**  Tim  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:46):**  Tim, you say that a paradigm shift is essential if we're to solve the twin crises in nature.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:51):**  But the fear of traditionally leftist solutions to global warming around taxation and legislative  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:56):**  interventionism led to decades of climate change denial from politicians, particularly  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:01):**  on the right. And it seems to me that in terms of renewable energy sources and transport,  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:06):**  there's still a role for big business. But when it comes to agricultural land use and  
**[0:31:10-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:10):**  food production, there's a genuine urgent need for power to shift back to smaller scale  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:16):**  businesses and producers who are closer to the communities and to the soil and the watersheds  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:21):**  they serve, no matter what it is that they're producing, whether that's meat or dairy or  
**[0:31:26-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:26):**  fruit or nuts or cereal. And I just I wonder from your perspective, can we achieve that  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:31):**  economic paradigm shift in time to solve this unfolding ecological emergency?  
**[0:31:36-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:36):**  Tim Yeah, I mean, there were quite a lot of questions  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:38):**  really in that. I mean, I think the way that I think about this is you don't spend too  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:43):**  long on thinking about whether you've got enough time because it takes up time. And  
**[0:31:47-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:47):**  so the longer you spend worrying if you've got enough time is still time that you're  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:49):**  not actually doing anything. We know the things that we need to do. So we should get on and  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:53):**  do them. And I mean, I believe that in a model in relation to land and to agriculture and  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:00):**  rural communities, generally, that is about diversity, I think diversity really matters  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:05):**  because the land is diverse. It has different characteristics, it has different strengths  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:09):**  and people in relation to that land are also diverse. But the big paradigm shift that you  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:14):**  were asking me about really is one that has to happen, I think, quite predominantly at  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:19):**  an economic level. I was in a seminar, I think it was the Bank of England that had organized  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:25):**  it and I listened to this economist talking about the role of agriculture in climate change,  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:30):**  quite seriously say at one point, listen, don't worry about agriculture, it's less than  
**[0:32:35-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:35):**  3% of the GDP. And of course, to an economist less than 3% of the GDP matters not at all,  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:42):**  let's protect the financial sector, because that's, you know, at the time, I don't know  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:45):**  what it was 10 or 11% of the GDP. But of course, it's nuts, because food is the basis of our  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:50):**  lives and our livelihoods. And agriculture is, is the basis for future prosperity. But  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:56):**  economics that doesn't see that is out of its mind. And likewise, you know, it's not  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:01):**  seeing the impact of people in relation to that 3% of the GDP either. We did some some  
**[0:33:06-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:06):**  interviews in the first phase of the Food Farming Countryside Commission. And the one  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:09):**  that really stood out for me was an interview with a worker in the food chain, who could  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:16):**  not afford to pay for food for himself and his family had to rely on the charity of food  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:22):**  banks in order to pay, because why because that food chain actually had become a source  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:27):**  of extraction of the surplus of ordinary people working in the food chain, to the extent that  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:34):**  they could no longer even afford the food that they were working towards, which is just  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:38):**  a travesty. And then in, you know, to take the analogy about the statistics further,  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:44):**  GDP of 3%, maybe all the agriculture is worth in the advanced economies, but actually, it's  
**[0:33:50-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:50):**  60% of the GDP of the poor, as has been pointed out. And that, you know, that's a huge amount  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:58):**  of the rural livelihoods that belong to the land that belong to our management of the  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:03):**  land that tell us and provide the resources for the agriculture that is going to give  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:09):**  us the food that ends up on our table and keeps us alive. And yet, that's the tragedy.  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:15):**  That's the paradigm shift I think we have to look at. We do not have an economics that  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:20):**  is fit for purpose in managing the land, the agriculture, or indeed the livelihoods of  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:25):**  the people who work in that sector. And that is actually, I would argue, a kind of almost  
**[0:34:30-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:30):**  an obscenity in modern 21st century countries who think of themselves as advanced economies  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:37):**  to denigrate the agricultural sector in that way, to fail to protect its workers, and to  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:44):**  not even think seriously about the issues like the integrity of the soil that Christiana  
**[0:34:49-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:49):**  was talking about.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:50):**  And it seems to me that this is why land use is different, because it is much more complex,  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:56):**  because you're able to deliver these multiple outcomes, and land needs to deliver these  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:01):**  multiple outcomes. And one of the things that concerns me about the climate conversation  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:05):**  when the drive is towards emissions reduction efficiency is that we somehow miss out these  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:11):**  other elements, the need for diversity, the need for rural livelihoods that rely on this  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:17):**  land, the need to restore biodiversity and soil health, which is important, not least  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:21):**  in terms of adaptation, because if we're looking for food security in the future, nutritional  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:26):**  security, we need land that is going to be able to produce even if there are very challenging  
**[0:35:32-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:32):**  climate impacts in the future. And so it becomes complicated, Christiana.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:36):**  Christiana Davidson Yeah, and it reminds me, Finlow, that, you  
**[0:35:39-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:39):**  know, I go back, way back to the Rio Convention in 1992, where in our collective ignorance  
**[0:35:47-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:47):**  and our puny little brains, we developed three conventions that are basically being pursued  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:54):**  as silo issues, the climate, the biodiversity, and the desertification convention, all each  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:02):**  of them with a whole infrastructure, international infrastructure, each of them with the corresponding  
**[0:36:08-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:08):**  national infrastructure, and each of them pursuing goals that were conceived of as at  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:15):**  that time as being independent of each other. Fortunately, and it's taken us 30 years, but  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:21):**  fortunately, we're now beginning to understand that these things are not silos, that they're  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:26):**  actually totally independent of each other. And we're beginning to see the convergence  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:31):**  of all of these issues. I actually think that COVID-19 has been very, very helpful in helping  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:37):**  us to converge cognitively, intellectually converge these issues and understand how interlinked  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:43):**  all of this is. But unless we truly understand that, and unless we understand, let me just  
**[0:36:49-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:49):**  take, you know, fast forward from 1992 to 2015, 17 SDGs, sustainable development goals  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:57):**  that were developed, you know, with a lot, a lot of diplomatic input from every country.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:03):**  But those 17 goals, if anybody can remember what the 17 are, are actually one goal. It  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:10):**  is actually the betterment of humanity in its home on the planet. And they're all interlinked.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:17):**  And unless we understand that, unless we understand that damaging one damages the others, and  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:22):**  improving one will improve the others. Unless we understand that and take advantage, take  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:29):**  truly enlightened advantage of the fact that improving one improves the others, that is  
**[0:37:34-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:34):**  the only way we're actually going to make it on time. If we see the attendant beneficial  
**[0:37:43-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:43):**  echoing from one over to the other.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:46):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:42):**  You've taken my fears and you've made me feel optimistic with that last answer, Christiana.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:50):**  So looking forwards with optimism, I wonder how, how should COP26 address these competing  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:57):**  demands that we have for land use? Is it possible for this international diplomatic process,  
**[0:38:02-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:02):**  this haggling that goes on between nations to address the urgency of climate mitigation,  
**[0:38:08-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:08):**  while ensuring that that drive for emissions reduction doesn't somehow undermine other  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:13):**  global priorities, such as the restoration of biodiversity and soil health, the need  
**[0:38:17-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:17):**  to improve land resilience in order to ensure nutritional security in every nation and for  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:23):**  every human being?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:24):**  I think we're on the way to that. Well, first of all, let's understand that there is no  
**[0:38:31-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:31):**  expectation of any big global agreement to come out of COP26. That's just not what is  
**[0:38:38-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:38):**  being expected. The big outcome of COP26 is the series of national, as we call them nationally  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:45):**  determined contributions, that is every country coming forward to say what they're going to  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:50):**  do to contribute. And then, of course, the invitation to companies and financial sector  
**[0:38:55-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:55):**  and civil society to also contribute to the solution. So there is not a negotiated package  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:01):**  such as there was in the Paris Agreement. So where we need to see this convergence and  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:08):**  the focus on land use is actually in both the national commitments that are being made.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:14):**  So we need to see nations begin to understand that. But also very importantly, corporations  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:19):**  and the financial sector, if they continue to build a wall between all of these things,  
**[0:39:25-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:25):**  we are not going to get forward. So in their commitments that they're making, the more  
**[0:39:29-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:29):**  that they integrate, and I see the growth of that integration every day, the better  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:37):**  we're going to be. But let's not look for a negotiated package that is going to solve  
**[0:39:42-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:42):**  this at COP26.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:43):**  I know that there has been a feeling over the last decade or so from developing countries  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:49):**  that it's the rich nations that are in the driving seat here and that there is a danger  
**[0:39:53-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:53):**  that poor countries will bear the brunt of some of the decision making. Do you feel that  
**[0:39:57-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:57):**  poorer nations are now starting to be heard on a level playing field with richer nations?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:03):**  I go back to Tim's point. Tim made a very good point. He said, you know, the in developing  
**[0:40:10-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:10):**  nations, 60% of the GDP is actually agriculture, 3% in industrialised countries. Let's understand  
**[0:40:17-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:17):**  that. Who's producing the food that the world needs? Right. So let's just truly understand  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:24):**  that none of us can survive without food, that most of the food is being produced in  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:29):**  developing countries. And it needs to be priced properly and it needs to be transported properly  
**[0:40:35-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:35):**  and we need to cut down on waste. But basically, the global south is the farm for the global  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:42):**  north. And who is going to survive without that farm?  
**[0:40:46-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:46):**  Tim, let's go back to story. Building on Christiana's call for relentless optimism, can you paint  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:53):**  me a picture of what the future ought to look like for land use? Nine years from now, in  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:59):**  2030, if or when we have achieved the changes necessary to stay within 1.5 degrees, what  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:06):**  does the new paradigm look like in terms of land use?  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:10):**  I don't know that I can answer this story in the way, answer this question in the way  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:15):**  that you want me to. I mean, I could point to sort of nice pictures. I mean, you know,  
**[0:41:20-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:20):**  William Morris in News from Nowhere does a pretty good job of pointing to this world.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:26):**  And there are other pictures, of course, that almost take the mickey out of that and say,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:30):**  well, you know, the world isn't a rural idyll and we can never get back to pretending that  
**[0:41:35-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:35):**  it is. So somewhere between those things, you know, I think the future lies. And in  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:40):**  a way, rather than sort of saying, well, what is the promised land going to look like when  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:45):**  we get there? I almost feel as though the most important thing is to look at the signposts  
**[0:41:51-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:51):**  and to read the signs that are pointing us, you know, towards a place which is more optimistic  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:57):**  and away from a place actually which has been quite destructive. And I do think that the  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:03):**  core element in that destructiveness and the opposite direction is the one that we want  
**[0:42:09-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:09):**  to travel from this is the way in which finance has operated in the agricultural sector, the  
**[0:42:16-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:16):**  way that it's become a kind of rent seeking activity on the back of the fact that land  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:23):**  itself has a value on which we can extract rents. And indeed, it has created a kind of,  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:29):**  you know, a chain which is pumping money out of the rural land, pumping money out of the  
**[0:42:35-0:42:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:35):**  countryside, pumping money out of agriculture, in pursuit of profits elsewhere in the financial  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:42):**  food chain rather than the agricultural food chain. And we desperately need not to follow  
**[0:42:49-0:42:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:49):**  that signpost anymore. We definitely need to look in the other direction and point to  
**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:54):**  the mechanisms that value land, that value work on the land, that value people who work  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:00):**  on the land, that value the integrity of the soil, that create value out of the diversity  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:06):**  in nature, that see the rural environment as a place where we can capture carbon, increase  
**[0:43:13-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:13):**  rural livelihoods and provide the food that allows us to survive as human beings. And  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:20):**  to build those mechanisms, you know, almost if necessary from the bottom up, asking what  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:26):**  it is that farmers need, what kinds of returns on their activities are actually consistent  
**[0:43:32-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:32):**  with healthy soils and regenerative lands, and understanding that those returns and they're  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:37):**  typical of the returns in nature of the order of a few percent at the very most, sometimes  
**[0:43:43-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:43):**  even a fraction of a percent return on the effort and the money that goes into those  
**[0:43:49-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:49):**  activities. And if you then attempt out of that, out of that, those slim margins that  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:56):**  nature allows us in order to be resilient and regenerative, if you then attempt to pump  
**[0:44:03-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:03):**  productivity and profit out of those systems, that's the point at which you lose the story.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:10):**  That's the point actually at which, you know, the story you're looking at is a very dystopian  
**[0:44:13-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:13):**  one. It's one where the soil no longer supports our children, the one where the people who  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:19):**  work on the land are no longer able to support themselves, where there is no sequestration  
**[0:44:24-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:24):**  of carbon, where we don't feed the people who are the poorest on the planet, and where  
**[0:44:30-0:44:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:30):**  the system itself begins to desert us. And it isn't the happy picture that you wanted  
**[0:44:37-0:44:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:37):**  me to paint. But I think I'm saying, you know, that there is a place where that resilient,  
**[0:44:44-0:44:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:44):**  regenerative nature, that strong, resilient farming, those rural communities that are  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:50):**  diverse and vibrant and support livelihoods for ordinary people, that is all there for  
**[0:44:56-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:56):**  the taking. But only if we pay attention to the signposts at this point in time and follow  
**[0:45:03-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:03):**  the road that leads us there.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:05):**  Christiana, I just want to come back to you finally. Just to touch on your family history,  
**[0:45:11-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:11):**  your father established the Social Democratic Party of Costa Rica. He led a revolutionary  
**[0:45:16-0:45:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:16):**  army. He served three times as president. But before that, he was a farmer. And you've  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:21):**  said that we're all farmers of the future. Now, just through that three line story, you've  
**[0:45:27-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:27):**  seen big change. You've experienced big change. You know it can happen. Surely that must make  
**[0:45:34-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:34):**  you or contribute to the optimism that you have. And so with that in mind, are we going  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:40):**  to stay within 1.5 degrees?  
**[0:45:41-0:45:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:41):**  Let me ask a question against that question, Finlow. Can we afford not to? That's the question  
**[0:45:49-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:49):**  that we have to face. The fact is, we can't afford, we cannot afford to go over 1.5 because  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:58):**  the level of physical destruction, the level of economic destruction above all, and biodiversity  
**[0:46:04-0:46:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:04):**  destruction, but above all the level of human misery and pain is such that we can't even  
**[0:46:13-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:13):**  conceive it from where we are right now. And that is something that we cannot be responsible  
**[0:46:18-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:18):**  that we cannot to use Tim's points of the signposts. We cannot put those signposts into  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:27):**  the path and follow that path because then it will be our responsibility. So we don't  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:32):**  have any other option. Don't ask me, you know, can we get to 1.5? The scientists have already  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:37):**  said yes. It's not my opinion. It's the scientists who have said, yes, you're barely, barely  
**[0:46:42-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:42):**  there. You can still squeeze in under the door. The question is, do we have the will,  
**[0:46:50-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:50):**  the determination, the stubbornness, the obstinate staying the course power to make it actually  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:58):**  true because under our watch, Finlow, you and me and Tim, we are not going to let future  
**[0:47:06-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:47:06):**  generations live in a world that goes above 1.5. We just can't.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:47:14):**  And for that, we need a really positive story for land use. We need to really understand  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:47:21):**  the contribution that land use can make. I'd like to thank my guests, Christiana Figueres

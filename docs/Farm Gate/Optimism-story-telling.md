**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Land Unlocked, a collaboration from the Food Farming and Countryside Commission  and the Farmgate podcast. I'm Fenlow Kustain, the chief executive of Farmwell, and in this  series I'm talking about land use, with influential figures in the UK and around the  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:20):**  world in the run-up to COP26 in Glasgow this November. Land is all too often the silent  partner in climate change discussions, and yet the way we manage land and produce and  supply food holds the key to unlocking lasting solutions not only to global warming but also  
**[0:00:38-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:38):**  to biodiversity restoration and the fair distribution of good quality, diverse and nutritious meals.  In this programme, I'm thrilled to be joined by two truly exceptional people.  Christiana Figueres is an internationally recognised leader on global climate change.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:00:55):**  She was executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  from 2010 to 2016, the force behind the Paris Agreement. Today she is the co-founder of  Global Optimism and co-host of the podcast Outrage and Optimism. Her new book is called  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:11):**  The Future We Choose â€“ Surviving the Climate Crisis, which she co-authored with Tom Rivett-Carnack.  Professor Tim Jackson is an ecological economist, a writer, and he's a commissioner for the  Food, Farming and Countryside Commission. Since 2016, Tim has been director of the Centre  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:27):**  for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity at the University of Surrey. And between 2004  and 2011, Tim was economics commissioner for the UK Sustainable Development Commission,  where his work culminated in the groundbreaking book Prosperity Without Growth. Not only that,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:01:44):**  but he's also written a plethora of award-winning plays for BBC Radio. Welcome both.  Hello, Finla. It's wonderful to be here today with you and with Tim, who I can't believe  it, but we haven't met. So this is the first time.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:00):**  It's really strange, isn't it? And Finla, you should probably mention that we both have  the honour of being Hillary laureates, which is awarded by the Hillary Institute in New  Zealand in memory of Edmund Hillary. And Christiana is the latest Hillary laureate, I think. And  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:15):**  I was Hillary laureate five years ago. So it's a pleasure to be here.  Wonderful. Well, as I say, welcome to you both. Christiana, I'd like to come to you  first if I may. The Paris Agreement of 2015 is hailed as a global breakthrough in our  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:31):**  united struggle to avert the climate crisis. You led that process as executive secretary  of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Six years on, looking back, was it  the tipping point you hoped for? Well, I'm afraid that on something as complex  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:02:49):**  as climate change, there is no one tipping point that is actually going to be any sort  of magical solution. I think it is the compounded effect of several tipping points. And I think  we're seeing those compounded effects. Now, the agreement definitely was the start of  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:11):**  a very new approach to the evolution of the global economy. And I have not that it's my  term, but I have now seen several analysis out there calling on the Paris effect. Why  the Paris effect? Because since the agreement, which clearly points out and marks out the  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:35):**  decarbonization rate and scale that needs to occur around the world in order to keep  us safe. Since then, we have seen so much progress, not enough. Let me underline that  three times. But we have seen quite a bit of progress on renewable energy generation,  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:03:55):**  certainly on finance. And I don't know if you want to talk about that, but quite a shift  in where financing is going, quite a shift in where fossil fuels are going, and quite  a shift in where global transport is going. So all of those areas actually really being  
**[0:04:14-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:14):**  benefited by the Paris effect and into what is increasingly being recognized as exponential  transformations. Big exception here, land use, big exception. That is the Cinderella  at this party because we haven't focused enough on that. And I'm sure we want to go deeper  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:36):**  into that issue here. Absolutely. And of course, land use, there's complexities in there, a  much less linear challenge perhaps than transport and energy. But we'll come to that, as you  say in just a moment. And I'm interested in the way that, looking at the news, I've seen  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:04:52):**  so many new commitments and new pledges in the run up to Glasgow in November. Was it  like that around the Paris Agreement? Was there this sort of year or six months when  nations were starting to vie together to see who could pledge the most? Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:08):**  That is actually what is prescribed in the Paris Agreement, that every five years, countries  will take a look at what they have done on decarbonising, how much more they can do because  of newly available technologies, how much more they can do because of financial shifts  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:23):**  and policy effect and then come up with their new ambition levels. So what we're seeing  now is basically a repeat performance, hopefully an improved performance of what we saw in  the 12 months leading up to the Paris Agreement, where all countries came in to register the  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:41):**  first tranche of their emission reduction commitments. And now we're seeing them coming  forward with the second tranche of their emission reduction commitments as prescribed by Paris.  This will happen every five years. This time it's a little bit strange. It's a six year  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:05:57):**  period because of COVID, but we will see this happen every five years.  Now, we're going to come on to land use, but at the same time, before we do that, I want  to think about the story of change. And both of you have really interesting experiences  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:10):**  in this area. Christiana, you recently founded Global Optimism. Optimism is a fantastic word  and so often in terms of climate change and other global crises that we face, optimism  seems to be in short supply. And you've characterised optimism not as a sunny day attitude, but  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:27):**  as a gritty and relentless pursuit. What makes you optimistic?  My choice. It's because we have to choose. Either we give in to the doom and gloom and  the helplessness and disappear into a dark room on the couch and cry and be miserable  
**[0:06:45-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:06:45):**  and despair forever, or we recognise the destruction that we have wrought on this planet. And because  of that, we stand up tall and strong and say because we have wrought the destruction, that  is why we now have the responsibility and actually we have the ingenuity and the capital  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:05):**  and the technology to do something about it and to be able to address climate change in  a timely fashion. So it's a choice. Do you want to give in to helplessness or do you  actually want to be much more optimistic in the sense of rallying everything you can to  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:25):**  be part of the solution? It's a simple choice. Are you part of the problem or do you want  to be part of the solution? And that is a choice, Vinlal, that I think we have to make  every single day.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:36):**  Tim, do you see yourself as an optimistic person?  Yeah, I kind of go along with that. It reminds me of Italian philosopher Gramsci who talks  about pessimism of the intellect, the optimism of the will. And I think that's right. You  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:07:48):**  know, we can think of all the bad things that there are with the planet, with the situation,  with what we've done to the planet, with the inequality that exists. We can worry about  that and we can and we should take responsibility for it. But actually, as Christiana says,  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:02):**  the choice to optimism is always there and it's a profoundly human quality. And it's  one I think that matters to us in this situation. You know, we're in the, if you like, we're  in the kind of final stages of a football match and we're kind of trailing a goal.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:16):**  And if we're the team that gives up at that point because we're too pessimistic, we've  already seen the outcome, then sure enough, we're going to lose. But we do, even in those  circumstances, kind of have a choice to try until the whistle blows. And I think that's  
**[0:08:28-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:28):**  what we should be doing. In a sense, see, people often think of optimism and hope as  being the antidote to despair. But I think actually the antidote to despair is action  and action is always possible. And that's, as Christiana says, is a choice that we can  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:42):**  all make.  So optimism is part of the story, but just, you know, sort of thinking a bit more about  your background, you're a true descendant of the Renaissance here, a thinker, professor,  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:08:52):**  a writer in the field of ecological economics, but also a prolific playwright. And it's that  last that I want to come to first here. As human beings, we were storytellers long before  we invented the wheel. Stories help us, you know, as we've just been discussing, to make  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:08):**  sense of the world. And I wonder how important narrative is in addressing the crises that  we face today in nature.  I think it is important. It's stories that connect people. It's stories that people can  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:19):**  relate to. It's stories that make us see how the world is working and don't speak just  to fact, but to relationship and to meaning. And I think, you know, in a sense, we've kind  of given into a very simple story that also turns out, as it happens, to be completely  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:34):**  wrong, which is that the human species is kind of is a greedy, selfish, hedonistic species  that is only cruel to each other and wants only to pursue its own ends to whatever destructive  final conclusion that may lead. And we've also been told a story that that's a good  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:09:51):**  thing, that that's what keeps us working together. That's what keeps capitalism going. That's  what makes us, you know, that competition, that competitive element within us is the  thing that produces social good in society. And it's a really, it's a really interesting  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:05):**  story because it's one that you don't really find in the wisdom traditions in religion.  You don't really find it in poetry or literature. You don't find it in sociology or psychology.  You don't even find it if you ask people on the streets at the end of the day. The place  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:17):**  you find it and where we're absolutely convinced about it is in economics. And it's that kind  of, it's that story in a sense that's taken over our possibilities and usurped our sense  of what it means to live well and to be well and to be fully flourishing human beings.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:34):**  And it's wrong. So, so yes, the idea of telling a different story, a story more grounded in  reality, a story that offers us the choices that Christiana was talking about, that's  something worth telling.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:10:46):**  And it's always seemed to me that with economics...  Sorry, can I just end in to underline something really interesting that Tim has mentioned.  I'm an anthropologist by training. And so oral history has always been a fascination  
**[0:11:03-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:03):**  to me because we see so many different cultures and societies that over time have relied on  oral history in order to maintain their sense of identity and their sense of the future.  And we tend to think rather erroneously that oral history was a tool that was used in the  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:27):**  past by some societies. The fact is we are constantly using oral history. What we're  doing here right now is oral history. It is a very compelling determinant of how we think  about ourselves, who we are, how we turn up in the world. What do we believe in? What  
**[0:11:49-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:11:49):**  do we believe we are capable of? It is transmitted to us by those with whom we speak or transmitted  to those with whom we are in conversation and in conversation writ large. This is a  conversation. The conversations we have every day, the conversations that we have through  
**[0:12:10-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:10):**  many of our media channels. And so when the bottom line message of all of those stories,  all of those conversations is the one that Tim has said that we're actually at best,  we are egotistical, short-sighted, non-empathetic humans, and that that's the world that we  
**[0:12:35-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:35):**  inhabit and hence the world that we're going to continue to create. Well, it is then a  self-fulfilling prophecy. And that's why it's so important to be aware of those stories  that we tell, but that start in our mind. What are the stories that we have in our mind  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:12:57):**  about ourselves and about each other? Because those are the stories that we will then tell,  that we will communicate, and those are the stories that we will turn into reality. So  truly standing up to our better selves and to our capacity to be effective agents of  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:13):**  change is very important.  And how important is narrative in the diplomatic process? Because I think from the outside,  it can seem quite technocratic and remote, but of course, diplomats and politicians,  
**[0:13:24-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:24):**  they're human beings the same as anybody else. When you're trying to, well, I hope so. And  when you're trying to corral these people towards a common objective, how important  is that story? Are you having trade-offs between one another? Are you trying to sell a story  
**[0:13:39-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:39):**  to them?  Yes, but there is a mega story there that is an, that acts as an organising principle.  And the mega story that helped us to organise or to weave together the countless different  
**[0:13:54-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:13:54):**  threads that came together in the Paris tapestry, the mega story there was, what kind of a future  do we want to experience? And that was my conversation with almost 195 governments of  the world is, so tell me, what do you want for your people 10 years from now, 20 years  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:13):**  from now, 30 years from now? And the fascinating thing is that when you put your focus at that  time scale, then everybody, of course, is going to tell you what I want is a prosperous  economy that allows everyone to participate, that allows and ensures that everyone is healthy,  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:33):**  that everyone has a safe livelihood. And that's a mega story that is shared by everyone who  is a member of the human race. So once you have that mega story established, then you  walk that back and you say, okay, so what does that look like for country X, country  
**[0:14:52-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:14:52):**  Y, country W? And then you begin to weave those threads together. But it all obeys a  bigger long-term mega story that everyone has actually coincided on.  Do you think, Christiana, that's why 1.5 happened in Paris? Because in some sense, 1.5 was a  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:11):**  minor character, a kind of walk-on role for a bit part. It wasn't a major protagonist  as you were going into Paris and yet turned out to be a kind of, you know, this character  who walked on became the main story, in some sense, it's the big story coming out of Paris  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:26):**  because it aligned with that mega narrative that you're talking about.  Well, it aligned over time, Tim, right? And as you say, 1.5 as a maximum temperature rise  was sort of smuggled into the text almost in the last minute and was definitely done  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:15:46):**  on the impulse of the low-lying island states who knew that unless we keep to that a maximum  temperature rise, that their survival was in severe danger. But countries weren't ready  to accept that as a final outcome, as a final ceiling of temperature. So that's why in negotiations  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:07):**  you always try to find middle-of-the-ground text and that middle-of-the-ground ended up  being well below two or striving for 1.5. Since then, as you say, science has advanced  and we now know that there's actually a huge difference between 1.5 and two degrees. We  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:23):**  didn't know that back in 2015. And so, you know, kudos to every single country who really  insisted on that 1.5. They have been proven right.  This is fascinating. I could talk for an entire hour on this, but let's move on to land use  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:37):**  for the rest of our time. Now, Tim, your books, Prosperity Without Growth and more recently  Post Growth, contend that our economic model is broken. It's incapable of delivering us  from the climate emergency. Now, I want to challenge that just a little, at least in  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:16:52):**  terms of food and agriculture. Surely growth is necessary, but it needs to be redefined  away from the corporate profit led model where a small number of people get extremely rich  and towards a stronger, more vibrant countryside where there are new farm and food businesses  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:09):**  supporting a more resilient but growing rural economy in which power has shifted from the  city and back towards the fields.  Yeah, it's a very interesting challenge, Finno, because in a sense you've used the word  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:20):**  growth in three very distinct ways there. And in the most obvious way, agriculture is  about growth. It's about growing food and nature knows a lot about growth.  Grace is an incredibly important part of the resilience of nature and the cycles of nature.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:37):**  And what's interesting about it, though, is that it's also, you know, that kind of growth  is aligned with decay. It is aligned with cycles. And the decay becomes the part of  the growth in the next cycle. It's a regenerative process. And that regenerative process actually  
**[0:17:52-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:17:52):**  is a process that agriculture kind of knows very well and knows what the limits of it  are very well. But it's also a process that's gone wrong. You know, it's gone wrong in the  sense that in pursuit of growth at the economic level, this almost overriding drive towards  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:08):**  productivity, we put all kinds of chemicals on the land and fertilizers on the land. It's  a very energy intensive process. And that has had the perverse impacts actually of propping  up productivity over the short term and undermining it in the long term so that the quality of  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:22):**  soils actually, not least their inability to absorb carbon in the way that they that  we would like them to be able to do but even worse, perhaps their inability to produce  that same source of food on which we're going to rely on the future indefinitely, because  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:38):**  the farming models, the agricultural models have been pushed and pushed and pushed by  this idea of relentless productivity growth serving actually, not farmers, not land workers,  not agriculture itself, and not even really sustainable food, but serving the interests  
**[0:18:53-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:18:53):**  of the people who are kind of extracting value out of the land in the form of profits for  a minority of people. So it's that, that's the critique, I think that would come out  of prosperity without growth, not that we don't want a thriving rural community. Of  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:11):**  course we do. And you know, for goodness sake, those communities have suffered for decades.  So there's very definitely a role for increasing their prosperity, but also aligning that increase  in prosperity with the growth that happens through the cycles of nature in a regenerative  
**[0:19:29-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:29):**  agriculture.  So it's a redistribution to an extent of wealth, but certainly of power?  Yes, it is. I mean, you know, the question about about narrative that we were talking  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:39):**  about before is a very interesting one. Who controls the narrative is a question ultimately  of power, which is exactly why it's important to go back to narrative and to change the  narrative and put different narratives on the table. And then the narrative of a regenerative  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:19:53):**  nature puts different people actually in power, you know, and and it was a lesson from the  pandemic as well, you know, when things went down, it wasn't the financial analysts on  Wall Street that saved our lives. It was the farmers and the nurses and the doctors. And  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:07):**  they were the people who had been in the lowest ranks of power in many ways in society because  of the story, the narrative that we told about what prosperity is. And so, you know, kind  of shifting that around, changing that balance does mean actually giving power to people  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:24):**  who have not had it in the past, whose stories have been excluded from the mainstream narrative  and who are actually the most valuable people in society.  Jason Vale, The New York Times. So notoriously, power hungry isn't quite the right phrase,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:38):**  but they like to retain power at the center and devolving power back to individual people.  It's very difficult for governments. Do you think they've grown up enough to do that in  the time we have available?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:20:48):**  I actually have a much more optimistic view of government and what government is. We have  aligned our governments with kind of capitalistic power. We've allowed lobbying into politics  in a way that's undermined the role of democracy and government in the state itself. But actually,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:03):**  it's where government came from. It's not where democracy came from. It's not what democracy  means. It's actually much more aligned with a role that looks after the most vulnerable  in society, that distributes power fairly and equally, that supports those on livelihoods  
**[0:21:21-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:21):**  which might otherwise be skewed or even corrupted by the influences of big power. And this allows  for the conditions under which that distribution can happen. And I believe that is a, you know,  that view of government to me goes all the way back to the people who were the architects  
**[0:21:38-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:38):**  of democracy in the philosophy of the of the 16th, 17th, 18th century. And the idea of  a social contract is exactly what gives government the legitimacy to create the conditions so  that the poorest and the most vulnerable, including those who work on the land, have  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:21:56):**  themselves decent livelihoods.  Christiana, I wonder if you could reflect on that. But at the same time, I want to draw  you back to the very beginning of this podcast where we were talking about processes around  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:07):**  climate change and you said, yes, land use was missing. And I wonder why you think that  is.  Christiana Davidson I think it's so for several reasons. First,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:18):**  because it is so much more difficult to get your head around land use. It is 30% of the  problem. 30% of emissions come from land use, 70 from the energy side. And if it's 30% of  the problem, then it ought to be 30% of the solution. But typically, it is a much more  
**[0:22:39-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:22:39):**  distributed sector where the decisions on land use, on agriculture, on forestry are  so much more decentralized than they are in the energy side, where you have basically  a handful of very large energy companies who, if they decide to do the right thing, they  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:00):**  could actually make a huge difference. Land use is very, very different. And it goes all  the way from some agricultural companies that are large, but actually to millions and millions  of small landowners who have been using the land in the same completely unsustainable  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:18):**  and inefficient way for years. And especially when you look at food output, it is just so  inefficient what we're doing. Because when you see how much of the land area in the UK,  48% of all UK land is given over to animal agriculture, basically the same as over the  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:23:43):**  whole world. One half of our land area is given over to animal agriculture. It's taking  up one quarter of our irrigation water, it's emitting 15% of our greenhouse gas emissions.  And it's not really giving us an efficient move from the protein that is in the food  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:03):**  that these animals use to the protein that we consume. So I really want to make a huge  shout out here for plant based diets, because we have to move toward that. Yes, because  of climate change, but also just because of efficiency. It is the most inefficient way  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:21):**  to produce protein is to have, you know, these animals that should be with us for other reasons,  other than for us to eat them. Every single piece of beef that you have on your plate  has lost 97% of the protein contained in the plants that were eaten by that animal. Pork  
**[0:24:39-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:39):**  loses 90%, chicken 80%. It is just such a waste. And frankly, we are at such a point  in breaking through planetary boundaries that we cannot afford to be inefficient. We can't  afford to be inefficient about energy, we can't afford to be inefficient about food,  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:24:56):**  we can't afford to be inefficient about water, we have to be able to be minutiously efficient  and circular because every single resource that we have, we have to get one, two, three,  four, five times the use out of that resource. So it is time to include land use and everything  
**[0:25:14-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:14):**  that that means, reforestation, protecting of standing lands, move over toward agroecology,  move over to plant based diets. It is a huge family of issues. And it's difficult to wrap  your heads around it because each one of those sub chapters has its own barriers. That's  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:34):**  why I think we still haven't moved with the speed that we should on these issues.  Jason Vale,  But surely we're not talking about stopping eating meat and dairy products altogether  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:45):**  because there's so much of the world, which is grazing land, rough land, or there are  communities in developing countries that are very dependent on the livestock in much drier  areas where, where it's more difficult to grow arable crops or fruit and vegetables.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:25:59):**  It's about getting the mix right, surely starting from the land and working upwards.  Dr. Anneke Vandenbroek,  Well, we're definitely at the wrong side of that extreme, right? Definitely on the wrong  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:08):**  side of that range, because we are just not being efficient at all about the use of land.  We are extracting from the land without making it regenerative, without being able to repurpose  and capture back into the soil, the richness that it had originally, we're just extracting.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:29):**  Think of soil as the same way that we extract minerals. That's what we're doing to the soil.  We're just extracting, extracting, extracting, then we use very little of what we extract  and then we throw it. Food waste, absolutely just discard. We are not even careful about  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:45):**  our food waste. We do not, we are not recycling food waste back into the soil so that we can  be regenerative about the soil. It is just completely inefficient and irresponsible.  Dr. Mark Walsman,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:26:58):**  One of the ways in which it's most inefficient is actually that a very heavy meat-based diet  is not conducive to human health. And, you know, we know that in the advanced economies,  we're on the wrong side of that. We know because the World Health Organization tells us that  
**[0:27:12-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:12):**  more people now die from diseases of overconsumption and in particular from things like red meat  and heavy meat-based diets. And we know that actually we could be healthier and have a  more efficient agricultural system at the same time.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:27):**  Dr. Paul Edmondson  I want to come at that question.  Dr. Annette Mehr-S  
**[0:27:45-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:27:45):**  I would say that our view at Food Farming and Countryside  Commission and Farmwell is we need a complete mindset shift if we are going to solve the  climate crisis while at the same time reversing the crisis in biodiversity. When we talk about  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:13):**  high quality nutrition and feeding people well, and then talk about nature, nature gets  split down. There are different conflicting sort of issues. And I think you've touched  on this already, but I still want to ask you quite directly about what the future of land  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:26):**  use looks like to you. Whether it's about food production and a diverse food economy  being at the center of the change that you envision, or whether you think it is essential  to spare off land into different activities so that we end up with forestry here, rewilding  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:43):**  there and then food production intensified into ever smaller parcels.  Dr. Annette Mehr-S Well, that depends on whether those parts,  how effective and productive those parcels are going to be. We definitely have to return  
**[0:28:55-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:28:55):**  a lot of land to reforesting. That is definitely for sure, because otherwise we are creeping  into our biodiversity, our standing biodiversity that is already quite diminished. And so yes,  we have to have some land devoted to food production. But again, if that land is primarily  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:17):**  devoted to animal crops, then we're not being efficient with that. Why don't we just go  straight to those crops that give us the most protein and the most efficient use of protein?  So yes, we have to have more land restored. Yes, we have to have richer soil. Yes, we  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:36):**  have to see about us humans having better health and producing our food more efficiently,  both from a soil perspective, as well as from a protein intake perspective.  Jason Vale So if I think about that in a slightly different  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:29:50):**  way, with soil health, for example, and biodiversity restoration, sometimes the best ways of achieving  that regeneration in biodiversity is actually with livestock integrated in those systems.  And so if we take two different examples, we've got a Sitka spruce plantation, which  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:06):**  is really intensive, doesn't really do an awful lot for biodiversity, can actually exacerbate  flood management problems. And then on the other hand, we have an agroforestry system  where there are livestock integrated, but you've also got trees in that system, and  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:19):**  that pasture managed regeneratively. And then you're drawing down carbon at the same time  as restoring biodiversity and producing food. Is that acceptable in your view?  Tim  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:30:46):**  Tim, you say that a paradigm shift is essential if we're to solve the twin crises in nature.  But the fear of traditionally leftist solutions to global warming around taxation and legislative  interventionism led to decades of climate change denial from politicians, particularly  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:01):**  on the right. And it seems to me that in terms of renewable energy sources and transport,  there's still a role for big business. But when it comes to agricultural land use and  food production, there's a genuine urgent need for power to shift back to smaller scale  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:16):**  businesses and producers who are closer to the communities and to the soil and the watersheds  they serve, no matter what it is that they're producing, whether that's meat or dairy or  fruit or nuts or cereal. And I just I wonder from your perspective, can we achieve that  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:31):**  economic paradigm shift in time to solve this unfolding ecological emergency?  Tim Yeah, I mean, there were quite a lot of questions  really in that. I mean, I think the way that I think about this is you don't spend too  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:43):**  long on thinking about whether you've got enough time because it takes up time. And  so the longer you spend worrying if you've got enough time is still time that you're  not actually doing anything. We know the things that we need to do. So we should get on and  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:31:53):**  do them. And I mean, I believe that in a model in relation to land and to agriculture and  rural communities, generally, that is about diversity, I think diversity really matters  because the land is diverse. It has different characteristics, it has different strengths  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:09):**  and people in relation to that land are also diverse. But the big paradigm shift that you  were asking me about really is one that has to happen, I think, quite predominantly at  an economic level. I was in a seminar, I think it was the Bank of England that had organized  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:25):**  it and I listened to this economist talking about the role of agriculture in climate change,  quite seriously say at one point, listen, don't worry about agriculture, it's less than  3% of the GDP. And of course, to an economist less than 3% of the GDP matters not at all,  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:42):**  let's protect the financial sector, because that's, you know, at the time, I don't know  what it was 10 or 11% of the GDP. But of course, it's nuts, because food is the basis of our  lives and our livelihoods. And agriculture is, is the basis for future prosperity. But  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:32:56):**  economics that doesn't see that is out of its mind. And likewise, you know, it's not  seeing the impact of people in relation to that 3% of the GDP either. We did some some  interviews in the first phase of the Food Farming Countryside Commission. And the one  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:09):**  that really stood out for me was an interview with a worker in the food chain, who could  not afford to pay for food for himself and his family had to rely on the charity of food  banks in order to pay, because why because that food chain actually had become a source  
**[0:33:27-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:27):**  of extraction of the surplus of ordinary people working in the food chain, to the extent that  they could no longer even afford the food that they were working towards, which is just  a travesty. And then in, you know, to take the analogy about the statistics further,  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:33:44):**  GDP of 3%, maybe all the agriculture is worth in the advanced economies, but actually, it's  60% of the GDP of the poor, as has been pointed out. And that, you know, that's a huge amount  of the rural livelihoods that belong to the land that belong to our management of the  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:03):**  land that tell us and provide the resources for the agriculture that is going to give  us the food that ends up on our table and keeps us alive. And yet, that's the tragedy.  That's the paradigm shift I think we have to look at. We do not have an economics that  
**[0:34:20-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:20):**  is fit for purpose in managing the land, the agriculture, or indeed the livelihoods of  the people who work in that sector. And that is actually, I would argue, a kind of almost  an obscenity in modern 21st century countries who think of themselves as advanced economies  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:37):**  to denigrate the agricultural sector in that way, to fail to protect its workers, and to  not even think seriously about the issues like the integrity of the soil that Christiana  was talking about.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:34:50):**  And it seems to me that this is why land use is different, because it is much more complex,  because you're able to deliver these multiple outcomes, and land needs to deliver these  multiple outcomes. And one of the things that concerns me about the climate conversation  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:05):**  when the drive is towards emissions reduction efficiency is that we somehow miss out these  other elements, the need for diversity, the need for rural livelihoods that rely on this  land, the need to restore biodiversity and soil health, which is important, not least  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:21):**  in terms of adaptation, because if we're looking for food security in the future, nutritional  security, we need land that is going to be able to produce even if there are very challenging  climate impacts in the future. And so it becomes complicated, Christiana.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:36):**  Christiana Davidson Yeah, and it reminds me, Finlow, that, you  know, I go back, way back to the Rio Convention in 1992, where in our collective ignorance  and our puny little brains, we developed three conventions that are basically being pursued  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:35:54):**  as silo issues, the climate, the biodiversity, and the desertification convention, all each  of them with a whole infrastructure, international infrastructure, each of them with the corresponding  national infrastructure, and each of them pursuing goals that were conceived of as at  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:15):**  that time as being independent of each other. Fortunately, and it's taken us 30 years, but  fortunately, we're now beginning to understand that these things are not silos, that they're  actually totally independent of each other. And we're beginning to see the convergence  
**[0:36:31-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:31):**  of all of these issues. I actually think that COVID-19 has been very, very helpful in helping  us to converge cognitively, intellectually converge these issues and understand how interlinked  all of this is. But unless we truly understand that, and unless we understand, let me just  
**[0:36:49-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:36:49):**  take, you know, fast forward from 1992 to 2015, 17 SDGs, sustainable development goals  that were developed, you know, with a lot, a lot of diplomatic input from every country.  But those 17 goals, if anybody can remember what the 17 are, are actually one goal. It  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:10):**  is actually the betterment of humanity in its home on the planet. And they're all interlinked.  And unless we understand that, unless we understand that damaging one damages the others, and  improving one will improve the others. Unless we understand that and take advantage, take  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:29):**  truly enlightened advantage of the fact that improving one improves the others, that is  the only way we're actually going to make it on time. If we see the attendant beneficial  echoing from one over to the other.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:46):**  Jason Vale,  You've taken my fears and you've made me feel optimistic with that last answer, Christiana.  So looking forwards with optimism, I wonder how, how should COP26 address these competing  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:37:57):**  demands that we have for land use? Is it possible for this international diplomatic process,  this haggling that goes on between nations to address the urgency of climate mitigation,  while ensuring that that drive for emissions reduction doesn't somehow undermine other  
**[0:38:13-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:13):**  global priorities, such as the restoration of biodiversity and soil health, the need  to improve land resilience in order to ensure nutritional security in every nation and for  every human being?  
**[0:38:24-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:24):**  I think we're on the way to that. Well, first of all, let's understand that there is no  expectation of any big global agreement to come out of COP26. That's just not what is  being expected. The big outcome of COP26 is the series of national, as we call them nationally  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:38:45):**  determined contributions, that is every country coming forward to say what they're going to  do to contribute. And then, of course, the invitation to companies and financial sector  and civil society to also contribute to the solution. So there is not a negotiated package  
**[0:39:01-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:01):**  such as there was in the Paris Agreement. So where we need to see this convergence and  the focus on land use is actually in both the national commitments that are being made.  So we need to see nations begin to understand that. But also very importantly, corporations  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:19):**  and the financial sector, if they continue to build a wall between all of these things,  we are not going to get forward. So in their commitments that they're making, the more  that they integrate, and I see the growth of that integration every day, the better  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:37):**  we're going to be. But let's not look for a negotiated package that is going to solve  this at COP26.  I know that there has been a feeling over the last decade or so from developing countries  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:39:49):**  that it's the rich nations that are in the driving seat here and that there is a danger  that poor countries will bear the brunt of some of the decision making. Do you feel that  poorer nations are now starting to be heard on a level playing field with richer nations?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:03):**  I go back to Tim's point. Tim made a very good point. He said, you know, the in developing  nations, 60% of the GDP is actually agriculture, 3% in industrialised countries. Let's understand  that. Who's producing the food that the world needs? Right. So let's just truly understand  
**[0:40:24-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:24):**  that none of us can survive without food, that most of the food is being produced in  developing countries. And it needs to be priced properly and it needs to be transported properly  and we need to cut down on waste. But basically, the global south is the farm for the global  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:42):**  north. And who is going to survive without that farm?  Tim, let's go back to story. Building on Christiana's call for relentless optimism, can you paint  me a picture of what the future ought to look like for land use? Nine years from now, in  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:40:59):**  2030, if or when we have achieved the changes necessary to stay within 1.5 degrees, what  does the new paradigm look like in terms of land use?  I don't know that I can answer this story in the way, answer this question in the way  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:15):**  that you want me to. I mean, I could point to sort of nice pictures. I mean, you know,  William Morris in News from Nowhere does a pretty good job of pointing to this world.  And there are other pictures, of course, that almost take the mickey out of that and say,  
**[0:41:30-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:30):**  well, you know, the world isn't a rural idyll and we can never get back to pretending that  it is. So somewhere between those things, you know, I think the future lies. And in  a way, rather than sort of saying, well, what is the promised land going to look like when  
**[0:41:45-0:41:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:41:45):**  we get there? I almost feel as though the most important thing is to look at the signposts  and to read the signs that are pointing us, you know, towards a place which is more optimistic  and away from a place actually which has been quite destructive. And I do think that the  
**[0:42:03-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:03):**  core element in that destructiveness and the opposite direction is the one that we want  to travel from this is the way in which finance has operated in the agricultural sector, the  way that it's become a kind of rent seeking activity on the back of the fact that land  
**[0:42:23-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:23):**  itself has a value on which we can extract rents. And indeed, it has created a kind of,  you know, a chain which is pumping money out of the rural land, pumping money out of the  countryside, pumping money out of agriculture, in pursuit of profits elsewhere in the financial  
**[0:42:42-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:42:42):**  food chain rather than the agricultural food chain. And we desperately need not to follow  that signpost anymore. We definitely need to look in the other direction and point to  the mechanisms that value land, that value work on the land, that value people who work  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:00):**  on the land, that value the integrity of the soil, that create value out of the diversity  in nature, that see the rural environment as a place where we can capture carbon, increase  rural livelihoods and provide the food that allows us to survive as human beings. And  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:20):**  to build those mechanisms, you know, almost if necessary from the bottom up, asking what  it is that farmers need, what kinds of returns on their activities are actually consistent  with healthy soils and regenerative lands, and understanding that those returns and they're  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:37):**  typical of the returns in nature of the order of a few percent at the very most, sometimes  even a fraction of a percent return on the effort and the money that goes into those  activities. And if you then attempt out of that, out of that, those slim margins that  
**[0:43:56-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:43:56):**  nature allows us in order to be resilient and regenerative, if you then attempt to pump  productivity and profit out of those systems, that's the point at which you lose the story.  That's the point actually at which, you know, the story you're looking at is a very dystopian  
**[0:44:13-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:13):**  one. It's one where the soil no longer supports our children, the one where the people who  work on the land are no longer able to support themselves, where there is no sequestration  of carbon, where we don't feed the people who are the poorest on the planet, and where  
**[0:44:30-0:44:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:30):**  the system itself begins to desert us. And it isn't the happy picture that you wanted  me to paint. But I think I'm saying, you know, that there is a place where that resilient,  regenerative nature, that strong, resilient farming, those rural communities that are  
**[0:44:50-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:44:50):**  diverse and vibrant and support livelihoods for ordinary people, that is all there for  the taking. But only if we pay attention to the signposts at this point in time and follow  the road that leads us there.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:05):**  Christiana, I just want to come back to you finally. Just to touch on your family history,  your father established the Social Democratic Party of Costa Rica. He led a revolutionary  army. He served three times as president. But before that, he was a farmer. And you've  
**[0:45:21-0:45:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:21):**  said that we're all farmers of the future. Now, just through that three line story, you've  seen big change. You've experienced big change. You know it can happen. Surely that must make  you or contribute to the optimism that you have. And so with that in mind, are we going  
**[0:45:40-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:40):**  to stay within 1.5 degrees?  Let me ask a question against that question, Finlow. Can we afford not to? That's the question  that we have to face. The fact is, we can't afford, we cannot afford to go over 1.5 because  
**[0:45:58-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:45:58):**  the level of physical destruction, the level of economic destruction above all, and biodiversity  destruction, but above all the level of human misery and pain is such that we can't even  conceive it from where we are right now. And that is something that we cannot be responsible  
**[0:46:18-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:18):**  that we cannot to use Tim's points of the signposts. We cannot put those signposts into  the path and follow that path because then it will be our responsibility. So we don't  have any other option. Don't ask me, you know, can we get to 1.5? The scientists have already  
**[0:46:37-0:46:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:37):**  said yes. It's not my opinion. It's the scientists who have said, yes, you're barely, barely  there. You can still squeeze in under the door. The question is, do we have the will,  the determination, the stubbornness, the obstinate staying the course power to make it actually  
**[0:46:58-0:47:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:46:58):**  true because under our watch, Finlow, you and me and Tim, we are not going to let future  generations live in a world that goes above 1.5. We just can't.  And for that, we need a really positive story for land use. We need to really understand  
**[0:47:21-0:47:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Optimism--story-telling-e12jmnb#t=0:47:21):**  the contribution that land use can make.

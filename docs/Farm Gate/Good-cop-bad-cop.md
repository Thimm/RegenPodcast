### Farm Gate  (2021-12-06)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Costayne, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and the founder  of the Food and Global Security Network.  Was COP26 a success? Arguably, there was incremental progress on emissions reduction, but climate  
**[0:00:19-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:00:19):**  policy is still disconnected from the rest of nature and while the COP hosts may claim  that 1.5 has been kept alive, there are few that seriously believe it'd be up and moving  any time soon.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:00:30):**  And yet, inside the COP conference centre, there were glimmers of hope. Yes, land, soil  and food systems were still absent from high-level policy negotiations, but there were discussions  taking place in official side events, such as the one I chaired in the European Union  
**[0:00:46-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:00:46):**  Pavilion with representatives from IPES Food, the World Economic Forum, the World Bank and  the UN Food Systems Summit. In fact, among these disparate and sometimes quite conservative  groups, there was a surprising level of agreement around the need for an agroecological transition  
**[0:01:02-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:01:02):**  and an unforced recognition that land use must deliver multiple outcomes.  In this programme, we're going to do a stock take. What was achieved at COP26 in terms  of global warming and agricultural land use? What was missing? What was fundamentally misunderstood  
**[0:01:17-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:01:17):**  at the top table? And what, now that Glasgow's dust is settling in the dreak, wintry mizzle,  do we need to do to ensure that an agroecological transition is lifted firmly onto the negotiating  table at COP27 and beyond?  
**[0:01:33-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:01:33):**  I'm joined by two giant thinkers and influencers in the agroecological world. Sue Pritchard  is the chief executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission, and Patrick Holden  is the founder of the Sustainable Food Trust. Welcome both.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:01:47):**  Hello.  Thank you. Thank you for that amazing introduction. You forgot to say we're both Welsh, Shminlow.  I did. Well, I'm not Welsh, but it's humans.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:01:56):**  I'm very Welsh.  And that you've both been haggling over Turkey while we've been waiting to start the podcast.  Let me start. And perhaps, you know, question for both of you, but Patrick, let me come  
**[0:02:06-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:02:06):**  to you first. What did you hope that COP26 was going to achieve and was it delivered  for you?  Well, I thought that COP26 could have been the cop for food and farming. Like, you know,  
**[0:02:17-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:02:17):**  it could have been as big an event as Paris was for climate change, but instead shifting  the emphasis on the potential of farming and land use to be part of the solution instead  of part of the problem as it has been. But unfortunately, the UK government, who I guess  
**[0:02:33-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:02:33):**  could have taken that opportunity, failed to even notice it, let alone act on it. So  even though all the talk, I think, around COP26 in the places I was in, which wasn't  the blue zone, they didn't have a pass, wasn't the green zone because I just didn't get to  
**[0:02:49-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:02:49):**  it somehow. It was what some people have called the action zone, which is people who represent  the doers, the people who are the companies and the people who actually get on with things.  I think all the talk was about food and farming, but missing in action rather than actually  
**[0:03:06-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:03:06):**  acted upon.  And isn't that a weird thing? I mean, you say there that, you know, this was an opportunity,  you hoped that agriculture and food systems would be on the agenda and, you know, because  
**[0:03:16-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:03:16):**  the UK was leading this particular COP. And of course, in the UK, we have had this really  intense conversation over the last few years. So it is a remarkable missed opportunity.  So what about you? What do you think?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:03:28):**  My expectations were pretty low going into COP because the situation that Patrick just  described that food and farming, land use is kind of missing in action. We knew that  before the conference itself started because much of the work in setting the scene for  
**[0:03:44-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:03:44):**  the conference is going on for the previous six months. And so as the run up to COP unfolded,  and it was clear what was going to be on the agenda and what wasn't, my expectations were  really pretty, pretty low.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:04:00):**  And if they were low, were they met?  Yes and no. Yes and no. I mean, I think what I learned in the run up to COP and during  COP was that actually COP is its own kind of a process. It's a really painstaking process  
**[0:04:16-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:04:16):**  of international negotiations that's almost separate to the kinds of things that, you  know, Patrick and I and you, Finlow, are talking about all the time. We're talking about, you  know, big ambitions and a sense of urgency and transformational change. But actually  
**[0:04:31-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:04:31):**  COP negotiations are baby steps and are really kind of painstaking and bureaucratic, COP  conversations between countries who have got really, really complex interests to manage.  So I suppose the thing that I realised was that we need other parallel, we need other  
**[0:04:51-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:04:51):**  processes alongside those to create the sense of urgency, to create the sense of possibility  to mobilise other actors, non-state actors, business, government, but actually civic society.  The thing that really did excite me in this COP was the voice of civil society really,  
**[0:05:10-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:05:10):**  really growing alongside the kind of COP business. And, you know, as Patrick says, the kind of  thing that he was involved in, many others were involved in, you know, the Glasgow Declaration  about food and farming systems and the fact that, you know, there were lots of other activities  
**[0:05:25-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:05:25):**  happening adjacent to COP that gave me perhaps more hope that the structures for non-governmental  organisations to really put their demands on the table were becoming stronger. And that's  the thing that gives me a bit more hope.  
**[0:05:39-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:05:39):**  Jason Vale, Director of Global Development, The New York Times,  If governments just going to trundle its way towards wherever it's going to trundle its  way towards, then actually we need to put more emphasis onto civil society. We need  
**[0:06:07-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:06:07):**  to load more pressure onto companies and corporations. And so, you know, when we spoke to Christiana  Figueres in the summer for the Land Unlocked podcast, she said that one of the big mistakes  of the last 30 years or 30 years ago was choosing to run separate international processes to  
**[0:06:24-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:06:24):**  deal first with climate change and then biodiversity and desertification. And I'd add food security  in there as well. And I wonder if there was any sense that this COP did anything to change  that.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:06:36):**  Well, again, perhaps not as much as we would have liked. I'm trying to be deeply pragmatic  about it all. As a general note to self and a way for me to manage my, what would otherwise  be a completely bipolar relationship with this kind of work, I try to set aside feelings  
**[0:06:54-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:06:54):**  of hope or pessimism or optimism and just think, you know, what do we need to focus  on? What is the work that we need to do? And the work that was done at this particular  COP, it did talk about nature based solutions. It did bring in some really interesting work  
**[0:07:09-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:07:09):**  around deforestation. And it talked about the financial mechanisms that can invest in  climate action as well as nature based solutions. So there were some positives, I think, which  demonstrated that people are increasingly understanding the deeply interconnected relationships  
**[0:07:25-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:07:25):**  between climate, between biodiversity, food security, as you say, Finlow, but also a just  transition for countries all over the world. One of the great losses, I think, is the extent  to which the most vulnerable nations felt under supported and that the gains made have  
**[0:07:45-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:07:45):**  not heard them and not understood that for them, moderate gains create existential crisis.  But that said, the fresh focus on adaptation and even the inclusion of the loss and damage  category, even though it's not gone anywhere near far enough, I think begins to illustrate  
**[0:08:03-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:08:03):**  that the people are increasingly understanding that the challenges we face are deeply interconnected  and can't simply be siloed in the way that we have done in the past.  I think that's really interesting. I think it's a really positive spin actually on what  
**[0:08:17-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:08:17):**  seemed to me, you know, often certainly with things like deforestation, that it was almost  rehashing a conversation that had been had a decade ago and was sort of trying to find  new ways of delivering what had been promised in the past. But I think, you know, you were  
**[0:08:29-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:08:29):**  mentioning before, Sue, about the conversation that was happening outside of the conference.  And I wonder, Patrick, even if that conversation is changing outside, it still seemed to me  that inside at the top table, there's still a drive and possibly as a result of this COP,  
**[0:08:45-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:08:45):**  a renewed drive because of different understandings of what nature-based solutions means and how  we interact with nature, that there was a drive for a spreadsheet approach to land use,  a sparing off of large tracts for different activities, which always seemed to me grossly  
**[0:09:00-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:09:00):**  inefficient and perpetuates the problems that we face. And I wonder if you think that the  negotiators at COP really understand food and farming at all?  No, I don't think they do yet. And I'm afraid I agree with your, I admire and respect your  
**[0:09:15-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:09:15):**  pragmatism in the face of these challenging circumstances, Sue. But I do think it's quite,  the situation is quite, we've got a lot of work to do. And perhaps just to respond to  you, Finn, though, I'd say that there are two factors which spring to mind listening  
**[0:09:29-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:09:29):**  to this conversation, which I think needs to be kind of called out. Maybe some of what  I'm about to say is a little bit controversial. The first maybe is not so controversial, which  is that I think the UK Climate Change Committee just don't get it. So they are advocating,  
**[0:09:45-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:09:45):**  as you just mentioned, a land sparing approach to addressing climate change, by which I think  they mean, if I'm not misquoting them, further intensification of a sustainable nature, if  that's not an oxymoron on the best land, leaving room for more land to be rewilded, grow biofuels  
**[0:10:02-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:10:02):**  will be reforested. And the other approach really has been ignored by the Climate Change  Committee, namely a land sharing approach, which means producing food in harmony with  nature coming out of this siloed mentality, which I think still predominates, and sharing  
**[0:10:17-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:10:17):**  the land between food production and the reinstatement of the lost biodiversity, which has happened  during my farming lifetime. And because the Climate Change Committee, weirdly chaired  by John Gummer, who I know because I just spent a day with him last week, apparently  
**[0:10:32-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:10:32):**  doesn't seem to share that thinking, which is a really fascinating insight, is such a  huge influence on government that I don't think the UK government was able to know what  to say and what to think in terms of playing a leadership role on including the role of  
**[0:10:48-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:10:48):**  agriculture to become part of the solution. And the other community I blame, and this  is slightly more controversial, is to a degree the NGO community, because I think the NGO  community have joined this less but better meat bandwagon. Although you could say it's  
**[0:11:04-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:11:04):**  true in the application, in other words, what should people eat to be part of the solution,  the plant based bandwagon is really rolling all over the world now. But I think the truth  is much more complicated than that. And in fact, if you look at what's caused the wrong  
**[0:11:18-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:11:18):**  kind of agriculture, it's the intensification of plant based production, which is at the  root of the thing because we wouldn't have any intensive livestock industry without intensive  plant production, particularly grain production. And because the land sparers, the climate  
**[0:11:36-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:11:36):**  change committees don't seem to get that. And I think in some sort of way, the NGO community  have jumped on this idea that, you know, livestock are part of the problem, you can call them  one commodity and not differentiate between the ones which are part of the solution, one  
**[0:11:50-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:11:50):**  switch part of the problem, and have completely ignored plant production, which as I've just  mentioned is at the root cause of the thing. I think this is added to the confusion. I'm  not saying that the NGO community don't mean well, I know they do, you know, it's that  
**[0:12:05-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:12:05):**  this praise, eat less but better meat on the face of it seems reasonable, but I think it's  caused enormous confusion amongst the farming community, amongst the government, and probably  amongst many of the negotiators at the COP26. And I think that we can look forward to the  
**[0:12:21-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:12:21):**  COP27 to be where food and agriculture finally gets onto the agenda. Because as I'm sure  you will agree, Sue, all the side conversations were how food and agriculture was missing  from the from the Blue Zone. So I think without the Blue Zone, although it's baby steps, as  
**[0:12:37-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:12:37):**  you said, Sue, without the Blue Zone crunching all these issues, showing leadership and saying  we have to get back to true regenerative agriculture, which involves a return to mixed farming,  I think everybody else has been just frozen into inaction. So I think we've got some work  
**[0:12:52-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:12:52):**  to do to resolve some of these differences of view within the NGO community, if we're  going to be the influence that is needed right now.  Well, let's stay with that for a moment, Patrick, because it seems to me that that, you know,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:13:05):**  that situation that you talked about with the Committee on Climate Change and the situation  with NGOs, and I think there are plenty of NGOs out there who are interested in particular  environmental outcomes or particular vegetarian outcomes, who have used climate change as  
**[0:13:19-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:13:19):**  a proxy to push the agenda that they already had. But fundamental to this, and the reason  that they can do that is because the Committee on Climate Change still doesn't recognise  this conflict between an emissions focus and a warming focus for land use. And that seems  
**[0:13:35-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:13:35):**  to me to be central to the problem, especially when we discuss an agro-ecological transition  where ruminant livestock are essential. So you started talking about this. I was going  to ask you, Patrick, what we should be doing now to change the perception of livestock,  
**[0:13:49-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:13:49):**  and you started to talk about that before. What should we be doing now to change the  way that we see agro-ecology and livestock food production before COP27?  The fatal flaw, it seems to be, in the UK Climate Change Committee's strategy was that  
**[0:14:06-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:14:06):**  they factor in zero soil carbon sequestration from agriculture. So if you are anti-ruminant  livestock, which just about all the sort of woke people seem to be these days, obviously,  if you don't include the capacity of grass-based livestock systems, meaning cows and sheep,  
**[0:14:25-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:14:25):**  and animals to be able to sequester carbon to offset methane emissions, then you're going  to be left with a very sort of anti-ruminant conclusion. So unless that's recognised, and  then from that, you recognise that if there's a serious transition towards regenerative  
**[0:14:41-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:14:41):**  agriculture, then we can lay down some of the soil carbon stocks that we've lost. We  won't be able to go forward and promote a truly sustainable agriculture as part of the  solution. So I think we have to unlock that. We have to persuade the doubters that actually  
**[0:14:58-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:14:58):**  a return to mixed farming firstly can feed enough people, and then find a way how that  could find expression in policy and the application of the Pluto Pays principle in the redirection  of subsidies, and indeed a strategy for the whole of the world of agriculture, not just  
**[0:15:14-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:15:14):**  the UK. Then we could start to move towards maybe an Egypt COP27, which will become the  historically, the place where food and farming finally made it onto the negotiation table.  So you work very closely, I think, with a lot of NGOs. Do you think that we're being  
**[0:15:31-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:15:31):**  unfair?  Oh gosh, I mean, NGOs are as diverse as farmers, are they? I think it's very difficult to start  picking out a category and speaking on behalf of all of them. There are some NGOs that I  
**[0:15:42-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:15:42):**  think completely understand what we're talking about here, particularly NGOs that represent  the global south, just as there are farmers who are already doing their very, very best  to adopt the practices that we're talking about here in spite of prevailing conditions  
**[0:15:57-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:15:57):**  not being especially supportive. I think we're all missing the point, actually. For me, the  elephant in the room is the economics. We have a complete attachment, an inability to  imagine a future without growth, and the global food sector seems to me is in exactly the  
**[0:16:16-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:16:16):**  same position as the energy sector, which is that the value in it is based on a particular  way of operating, which is extractive, which is polluting, but which is enormously profitable  for some very, very large players. And they find it hard to imagine and work towards a  
**[0:16:36-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:16:36):**  different version of the future in which, some might say, they don't have a role. So  there is the potential for a massive conversation about stranded assets in the global food system  in exactly the same way we talk about stranded assets in the energy sector, in the fossil  
**[0:16:51-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:16:51):**  fuel sector, that we don't, we're almost afraid to face into it. To me, the arguments that  support the plant-based diets is because that doesn't actually challenge the underpinning  values of the global agribusiness system. Those big food processing businesses can still  
**[0:17:11-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:17:11):**  make plenty of money out of selling us processed foods, ultra-processed foods that are essentially  plant-based rather than meat-based. So meeting that agenda, but still producing highly polluting  food in masses of packaging that's really bad for our health. That's the other piece  
**[0:17:28-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:17:28):**  of this that I think we should not forget. That's the part of the conversation, I think,  the other, if you like, the other leg of the conversation that COP really struggles to  deal with and is implicit in so many missed moments of meeting between the global south  
**[0:17:43-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:17:43):**  and the global north. I completely agree with Sue that it's all  about the economics, but I'm slightly more, I'm slightly less down on the attitude of  the big food companies and retailers in the sense that I think that just about all of  
**[0:17:58-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:17:58):**  them now know that their own customers are getting disenchanted with at least some of  the food that they're having to buy from them and they know that the game's up and if they're  going to be part of the solution, you know, the pathway towards net zero, they have to  
**[0:18:11-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:18:11):**  change their food systems pretty fundamentally. And I've heard chief executives of companies  like Nestle, even McDonald's more or less say that much and certainly some of the supermarkets.  But I think where you're so right is that at the moment, if they try to make the changes  
**[0:18:26-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:18:26):**  that are needed, they're going to lose money because at the moment, as I know and you know  too, farming in a way which is climate friendly and nature friendly pays less well than producing  food in ways which degrades environmental capital and causes climate change. So unless  
**[0:18:42-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:18:42):**  we correct the economics where we can create a business case at scale for a truly agroecological  regenerative choose your term farming, then it's going to be impossible for those same  companies to make the changes that they now need to make to satisfy their customers. So  
**[0:18:57-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:18:57):**  that's where I think it comes back to us to somehow persuade the companies themselves  to ask governments to introduce the polluter pays principle.  I hear you, I absolutely hear you and it reminds me of a lovely conversation I had with the  
**[0:19:08-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:19:08):**  chief executive, Greg's, who, you know, fully acknowledged that his much loved sausage roll  is not the healthiest of foods. And he was saying, you're right, people shouldn't be  eating so many sausage rolls, but I just only want them to eat mine. And you know, you've  
**[0:19:23-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:19:23):**  got a laugh in the audience, of course. But the reality is that it just doesn't add up.  And I hear you, I hear, you know, McDonald's are, you know, are working hard to shore up  regenerative practices and Nestle are making some very bold statements. But is there really  
**[0:19:38-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:19:38):**  room in the world, a world that comes to terms with the fact that we in the global north  have to consume a lot less of that over processed, over commodified stuff, so that people in  the global south can have their basic needs met. So we have too many of those big corporations.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:19:57):**  I completely agree. Of course, you're right. But surely won't the production changes deliver  that change? So just give me one example. I'm old enough to remember when I was growing  up in the 50s and 60s, that chicken was a once a month treat. And that was because grain  
**[0:20:11-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:20:11):**  in those days was really expensive to produce, because actually it is ecologically expensive  to produce grain. But during the chemical farming era, grain has become very cheap,  we produced a lot more of it as a result, because we've used intensive farming methods.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:20:26):**  If we had a regenerative farming transition globally, the amount of grain that would be  produced in the world would reduce by more than half. And as a result, it would become  much more expensive and cheap chicken would be history. So the best way to wean ourselves  
**[0:20:43-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:20:43):**  off our global addiction to cheap meat is to change our farming systems. And at the  moment, the economic climate is not strong enough for that to happen either. So you've  got both the farming industry, not that I'd like to call it an industry, but let's say  
**[0:20:56-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:20:56):**  it's an industry at the moment. And the big food businesses are both trapped in an economic  world where doing the wrong thing pays and doing the right thing doesn't.  Absolutely. And I guess the big question for shareholders, as well as customers, is how  
**[0:21:12-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:21:12):**  the boards and the shareholders can help companies manage that transition much more quickly.  Because ultimately, it seems to me still, shareholder value trumps many of these other  considerations. It's a very, very brave chief executive or board that says, we are now going  
**[0:21:31-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:21:31):**  to do things that will give less dividends to our shareholders.  Yes, but I think you're so right on that, that the power of the investment community  to change things is really powerful. The combination of that and the mindfulness that is shared,  
**[0:21:46-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:21:46):**  I think in the chief executive community now that they don't want to become Kodaks. And  then the fear about stranded assets. And then if we had the power of the investment community  behind the shareholder element of it, behind the change that's needed, I think that would  
**[0:22:02-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:22:02):**  unlock things. Thanks both. That's been so interesting just  just listening to you talking there about the financial challenges and how to sort of  change the system. I just want to go back to the whole stuff about soil, Patrick, and  
**[0:22:12-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:22:12):**  just the idea that soil, this is something, if we regenerate the world's soils, we can  draw down a third of the carbon that we need to. So, it is utterly bizarre that soil just  doesn't factor into the COP negotiations. And why do you think that is?  
**[0:22:28-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:22:28):**  Well, I think it's partly because of what I mentioned earlier about this idea of sustainable  intensification. So, putting myself in the shoes of Chris Stark, who I think is the chief  executive of the climate change committee, if he signs up to the idea of sustainable  
**[0:22:44-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:22:44):**  intensification, which means growing more food with responsible use of chemicals on  the best land, I guess he may well be right, or they may well be right. But if you sign  up to that strategy, there will not be any net carbon sequestration. And then you might  
**[0:23:00-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:23:00):**  also know that the UK grassland scientific community currently are of the view that if  you have pasture land, if you put down pasture land, it sequesters carbon for the first 20  years, but then it plateaus. Now, I personally think, and I think a growing number of regenerative  
**[0:23:17-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:23:17):**  farmers think that their views on the capacity of grasslands to be a soil carbon bank and  to continue to sequester carbon are wrong. But right now, if you are a scientist, quote,  led by the science and you ring up the people who are the leaders of the research community  
**[0:23:35-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:23:35):**  on the potential of pasture land to be a soil carbon bank, that's what they will tell you.  So in a way, the climate change committee are following the current scientific orthodoxy.  So in order to change things where farming can become part of the solution, we have to  
**[0:23:53-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:23:53):**  not only realign, I think, the messaging from the NGO community with the farming community,  we also need to realign or educate, if I might be so rude, the scientific community about  why they've got it wrong about the potential of the soil to hold more carbon.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:24:10):**  Mason So there is so much anecdotal evidence, isn't  there? So much anecdotal evidence that that prevailing view is inaccurate. Do we need  to wait until the scientists have managed to spend several years kind of running their  
**[0:24:22-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:24:22):**  research? Or do you think it's possible to persuade policymakers that they've simply  got it wrong? They're not up to date?  Daniel It would be nice to think that we could just  
**[0:24:30-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:24:30):**  get on with it. But I think that the trouble is governments are led by science. So I think  we have to say to these scientists respectfully, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  And the reason why they haven't got evidence that under regenerative holistic, calling  
**[0:24:45-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:24:45):**  what you want management, grassland and soils under grassland management can not only build  soil organic matter levels, but actually build soil, we won't win these arguments easily.  So I do think that some work to be done, and we need to start immediately.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:25:00):**  And I'm sure that that view, that understanding that soil organic carbon can continue to be  grown, that there will be people within DEFRA who understand that and who recognise that.  But surely this is another problem, Sue, and the UK is a good example of this particular  
**[0:25:15-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:25:15):**  challenge, that agricultural departments are often seen as lesser departments. And so here  we've got the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy that is responsible  for climate policy and frankly doesn't seem to have the first clue about agriculture,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:25:30):**  and is fixated on emissions rather than warming from emissions, that is then directing the  Committee on Climate Change to look at emissions, so that's what they have to do. And then DEFRA,  poor old DEFRA, is right down the pecking order, kind of having to do what they've been  
**[0:25:44-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:25:44):**  told by base and by the Committee on Climate Change.  It's more of the same problem we've been identifying throughout this conversation, which is that  particularly in Western thought, we end up thinking in narrow channels, narrow silos.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:25:58):**  Policy is in exactly the same situation. And I think just quickly picking up that point  about the science, there is plenty of science about improving carbon in soil, we just have  to amplify it and illuminate it to the same level that the other scientific evidence has  
**[0:26:15-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:26:15):**  been. So we're not being anti-science at all in saying, okay, this specialty makes  this case, but over here, this specialty, this academic discipline and specialty, has  also made their own very strong case, and we think this is worthy of investigation.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:26:32):**  I think the thing that we try and do all the time at FFCC is point to how important it  is to take, if you like, a transdisciplinary view of the evidence, go to the heart of the  question that you were asking right at the start, and the question that Cristiano Figueres  
**[0:26:46-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:26:46):**  was asking, when you silo up huge, interconnected and fundamentally interdependent challenges,  you risk unintended consequences and unforeseen consequences. So it's a feature of Western  thought, it's a feature of the Western Academy, it is also a feature of UK governments. But  
**[0:27:09-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:27:09):**  if with my compassionate head on, that's typically because if we try and look at the  whole system all the time, our heads explode. So we have to carve up huge problems in ways  that become more manageable for action. You're right to say, I think, that very often, farming,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:27:27):**  rural affairs, the environment have been the poor relation at the policy table, even as  the evidence has been growing that so many critical solutions for big global problems  sit within that department, within the environment, with how we use the countryside, how we use  
**[0:27:46-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:27:46):**  our land, more sustainable land uses, and of course, food and farming. I think government  is stepping in that direction. The work that Michael Barber did on the public value framework  explicitly asks Treasury to require of departments to pick out those topics that are interdepartmental  
**[0:28:03-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:28:03):**  and multidimensional.  And Patrick, when we're talking about things like energy and getting government to understand  energy and using the mechanisms of power to change things, there's a relatively small  
**[0:28:15-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:28:15):**  number of people whose minds need to be changed. It's a small number of companies to change  the way that energy works. But when it comes to agriculture and land use, just in the UK  there's over 100,000 farmers. It's a lot of people. Do you think there's a degree to which  
**[0:28:33-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:28:33):**  governments are running scared of trying to tackle land use because they've got to change  the hearts and minds of so many individual people and individual businesses and it's  just easier to fix on transport, easier to fix on energy?  
**[0:28:46-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:28:46):**  Exactly why they're scared is a really important question. They may be scared because they  might conclude in a way rightly that if they took action on agriculture and food transition,  the price of food would go up and they might be thinking to themselves, that's so politically  
**[0:29:04-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:29:04):**  sensitive and if my government or the government took these actions, then it would be inflationary  on food and therefore we wouldn't get reelected. So that might be a factor. But I just want  to pick up your point about the energy transition and what we can learn from it. Here's a story  
**[0:29:20-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:29:20):**  I heard about the energy transition in the feed-in tariffs, which was led by the Germans.  Renata Kunats was the German agriculture minister. She's a Green. When she was in power, she  sat down with a man called Alexander Muller, who was her minister of state, right at the  
**[0:29:35-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:29:35):**  beginning of their time in office. And they plotted the energy change and they said, let's  go to the big fossil fuel companies, suggest we should have feed-in tariffs and that they  should, we should get money from the big fossil fuel energy generators to subsidise the feed-in  
**[0:29:51-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:29:51):**  tariffs. And they went to the big energy companies and I think they thought this was such an  outlying idea that they'd go along with it. And that formed the basis of the feed-in tariffs,  which have really led the energy transition. So what we really need now is a food transition  
**[0:30:05-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:30:05):**  or a farming transition. And I think we can do similar things to achieve it, namely to  make sure that we raise money from polluting practices and inputs and we use those, we  redirect those funds to support regenerative farming. And to your last point about, you  
**[0:30:22-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:30:22):**  know, whether it's too difficult to persuade thousands of farmers to go on that journey,  I don't think it is. I think there are, I speak to quite a lot of large scale farmers,  arable farmers, and I think there's not one of them that isn't wondering what they should  
**[0:30:35-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:30:35):**  do. But the problem we have at the moment is that they can see that if they switch to  regenerative farming, it would not only mean a fundamental change in their farming system,  but they'd have to go into mixed farming essentially, because if they're going to give up nitrogen  
**[0:30:47-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:30:47):**  fertiliser, the only way to build fertility is through a crop rotation. They're looking  at a crop rotation which might be up to 50% grassland and clover. And they're thinking,  why would I do that? Quite apart from the infrastructure investment that's needed, everybody's  
**[0:31:01-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:31:01):**  telling the public not to eat red meat anymore. So it just looks too risky. And then they're  looking for elms for inspiration and guidance. Good luck with that. And elms are sitting  absolutely frozen into inaction after five years and giving the farmers no leadership  
**[0:31:16-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:31:16):**  whatsoever. So I think that is a reasonable analysis of why we're not making any progress.  Jason Vale,  I'm sort of thinking about that conversation we had about science and the way in which  
**[0:31:27-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:31:27):**  we seem very much in the West to have an idea that science is something that comes from  the research community. It's something that comes out of labs and it's people with white  coats that need to do it. But actually there's so much anecdotal evidence and experience  
**[0:31:42-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:31:42):**  from within the farming community, not just here, but around the world. And many of the  solutions that we're talking about with agroecology are based on reconnecting with soil and becoming  indigenous with the earth again and using that indigenous knowledge, even if we're still  
**[0:31:56-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:31:56):**  talking about using new technology and data collection to inform that future relationship.  And just going back to COP26, there was really significant criticism of COP26 from groups  representing indigenous people. And I wonder if that sort of conflict around scientific  
**[0:32:12-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:32:12):**  understanding and the experience and knowledge of the way that the earth works is sort of  at the heart of that criticism and at the heart of this conversation.  I mean, again, I think it's important to say the science scientific inquiry is a process.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:32:27):**  There isn't any such thing as the science, which is somehow out there waiting to be discovered.  Scientific inquiry is a process of answering questions. We ask, we ask as human beings.  It's not a question of being anti-science. I don't want to sound like I'm being anti-science,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:32:43):**  but it's, it's recognising that there is knowledge and experience out there that hasn't come  through that scientific process.  Well, that's, well, I mean, again, I think I want to be cautious about that. There are,  
**[0:32:55-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:32:55):**  in the research community, there are different kinds of research and there are different  kinds of research processes that do privilege different forms of knowledge. The issue for  me is it's very often not commodifiable. You can't financialise it. I had a blinding flash  
**[0:33:11-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:33:11):**  that became obvious on a UKRI advisory group that I sit on when we were talking about the  kinds of projects that this particular programme would want to fund. And one of the criteria  for deciding projects was that it would be commercially viable. But the definition of  
**[0:33:28-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:33:28):**  commercially viable was for big companies, big players. And when I asked the question,  so how do we know whether doing less using more regenerative practices will be extremely  commercially viable for small, medium sized farming enterprises? There was a moment of  
**[0:33:46-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:33:46):**  silence. The problem arises when science is operating in service of a particular kind  of business, a particular kind of future. There is plenty of knowledge and evidence  and material to support the alternative. It just does not get amplified in quite the same  
**[0:34:06-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:34:06):**  way. So that's the challenge, I think. The challenge is how do we really listen to and  hear the kinds of knowledge and evidence that comes from indigenous communities, from seldom  heard communities, from communities in the global south, who want for themselves and  
**[0:34:19-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:34:19):**  their communities a version of farming and agriculture that isn't just about maximising  profit but allowing the whole community to flourish across a whole range of different  considerations. It's kind of back to the economics again, isn't it? Or the kind of underpinning  
**[0:34:36-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:34:36):**  values of the economic system in which we find ourselves and our ability to imagine  a kind of post-growth economics that recognises that it's us in the global north that has  to think somewhat differently about what we produce and how we produce it.  
**[0:34:50-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:34:50):**  Because there's still a view, isn't there, Patrick? When people are talking about indigenous  communities or indigenous agriculture, there's something slightly patronising about that  very often. Actually, rather than looking at indigenous communities as something from  
**[0:35:04-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:35:04):**  the past, this is where we need to be learning, isn't it? It's the anecdotal evidence of people  who are indigenous with the earth in our country. It's indigenous peoples around the world who  are doing the sort of thing that we now need to scale. But this is an enormous challenge  
**[0:35:20-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:35:20):**  when there are still so many companies and international mechanisms that are trying to  export that failing western approach to land use. And I wonder how we can build that knowledge  of an indigenous approach to agriculture, learn from it and do it in our own community.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:35:37):**  I agree and I think that Sue's analysis is spot on. I think that it is about challenging  that slightly patronising, now old view about the true importance of indigenous people,  small-scale regenerative agriculture and putting that at the centre of a transition plan. And  
**[0:35:58-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:35:58):**  I do think that to enable that and to unlock the economic environment where that would  be possible, we need to mobilise public opinion. My feeling is that that comes back again,  interestingly enough, in part, but only in part, to the NGO community. Because although  
**[0:36:15-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:36:15):**  the NGO community do not control public opinion, if you add all the major NGOs in this country  up in their membership, it's much, much larger than the membership political parties. If  you take the National Trust, WWF and the Wildlife Trust, RSPB and a few others, I don't know,  
**[0:36:31-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:36:31):**  you must be approaching collectively 10 million members. If I'm honest, I don't think that  some of the views that I've tried to express during this conversation are understood and  shared by all of them in an editorial sense. So I think if we want to have an agricultural  
**[0:36:46-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:36:46):**  renaissance, the sort of thing that Colin Tudge goes on about at the Oxford Real Farming  Conference, we have to mobilise those NGOs and their editorial positions. And I think  that that is the conversation that needs to develop from where it is right now. And the  
**[0:37:02-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:37:02):**  point about the plant based diets bandwagon is only one part of it. I mean, this might  be requiring some analysis. I'm a son of a psychiatrist, I'll get this off my chest.  For the last 30 or 40 years, when I was at the Soil Association, we were advocating a  
**[0:37:18-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:37:18):**  change to, you know, what I would call now regenerative farming based on those the kind  of principles that Sue was just talking about. But the truth is the NGO community was pretty  disparaging about it. I think they thought that Patrick Holden is like a nice bunch of  
**[0:37:32-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:37:32):**  well meaning hippies, but it'll never really catch on and go to scale. But I think many  of the NGOs genuinely swallowed the Kool Aid from the old math and the NFU and everyone  that actually grown up farming needed chemicals. And I'm not sure that we've completely shifted  
**[0:37:47-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:37:47):**  that position yet. That may be just me being, you know, sound great about something. But  I do think there's a discussion to be had here. I'm sure I was part of the problem myself.  But you know, we're in an existential crisis here. And I think that the big power to influence  
**[0:38:02-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:38:02):**  public opinion is in part in the hands of the NGO community.  Okay, so we've got two leaders from the NGO community here. And I wonder, what is it that  we need to do for that transitional plan that you were mentioning there, Patrick, what do  
**[0:38:16-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:38:16):**  we need to do in the next six months in the next three months to make sure that COP 27  is the turning point that we hope that COP 26 was going to be?  Well, I think we need to build a new consensus. And I think Sue's in a pivotal position here  
**[0:38:31-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:38:31):**  because she's, her board and all the old commissioners Sue, really do span quite a breadth, don't  they, of institutions and organisations in leadership positions. So maybe there needs  to be some sort of honest conversation where we hammer out some of these issues in a safe  
**[0:38:49-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:38:49):**  environment with lots of trust. I think there's an apparent consensus, but I'm not sure that  if you really look underneath it, it's quite as it seems to be at the moment.  That's what it always seems to me that you know, if you start off with relatively generic  
**[0:39:02-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:39:02):**  statements like sort of talking about agroecology or regenerative agriculture, then it's quite  easy to build consensus. But once you start trying to drill down into what that actually  means, then that consensus falls apart quite rapidly. And we really need someone to moderate  
**[0:39:18-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:39:18):**  that conversation to make sure that we can have that conversation that you just were  talking about, Patrick, but then help us convene around a vision of the future, Sue.  Well, absolutely. And you were asking what we're doing for the next three months, next  
**[0:39:32-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:39:32):**  six months. I'm absolutely focused on holding open what one of our commissioners, Helen  Browning, calls the big tent, which means that we have to focus on the things that we  can do together and not perhaps focus on the things that separate us. That's just the route  
**[0:39:48-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:39:48):**  to more polarisation and more argument. And, you know, the narcissism sometimes of small  differences as Freud calls it, or the people's fronted liberation front of Judea, as the  Life of Ryan calls it. But so finding those points where we can agree and we can make  
**[0:40:03-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:40:03):**  progress, and very often that's baby steps. But just as a, you know, a quick aside, Patrick,  you must be feeling more optimistic. And quite rightly, being able to say, I told you so  when we can see around us, a massive shift towards acceptance that regenerative farming  
**[0:40:22-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:40:22):**  is the most promising route to the future. So I think, you know, those folks have been  doing this work for decades and decades and decades, 50 years, 60 years, 70 years, can  I think allow themselves, you know, a modest pat on the back. So the first thing is keeping  
**[0:40:39-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:40:39):**  the consensus open so that we can make a shift. The second is pointing to the grassroots movements  where change is already happening. I think it's a real antidote to the cynicism of people,  of some people in some leadership positions who say, this is just pie in the sky. This  
**[0:40:57-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:40:57):**  isn't realistic. When we can point to the growing movement of people in all scales of  farming enterprise, who are already making progress, whether they're small horticulturalists  or when they're running big estates, they are on either in that movement, and they're  
**[0:41:11-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:41:11):**  making change. And then the last thing I'm obsessing about at the moment, and in fact,  we've got a meeting tomorrow on this very subject bringing together, I hope the start  of a new consensus around it is the money. The money has to flow where the real work  
**[0:41:28-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:41:28):**  is needed. We hear a lot about the wall of finance waiting to crowd into nature based  solutions, you know, carbon and nature credits, but at the moment, the market, the market's  looking after the market, capital is looking after capital. And that money is pouring into  
**[0:41:42-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:41:42):**  initiatives, which do not connect to public benefit or public value, and in fact, are  very much at risk of taking away the possibility of more strategic decision making on the parts  of countries and governments to make sure that private capital aligns with government  
**[0:42:00-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:42:00):**  intention so that we're all moving in the same direction. So I think we're at a critical  moment about making sure the money works in the way that it needs to, and that it's invested  in the things that it needs to invest in. And where it's not investing properly at the  
**[0:42:13-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:42:13):**  moment is in regenerative and agro ecological futures. And that's what I'm obsessing about  now for the next three months, six months.  When you say that, Subin, it's fascinating to hear, and it's really interesting. And  
**[0:42:23-0:42:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:42:23):**  I think that whole conversation around finance, of course, has global influence. But when  we're talking about NGOs and getting them together, that's what we're talking about  at a national level, isn't it? And of course, we need global change. And I wonder, Patrick,  
**[0:42:37-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:42:37):**  just sort of coming to you, finally, when different parts of the world are so clearly  at different stages of development, and when there are so many conflicting narratives,  how do we make, you know, we're convinced that our voice is right, that agroecology  
**[0:42:53-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:42:53):**  is the way forward. How do we make our voice and our ideas the strongest and most compelling  at a global level?  Well, I think we listen to what Sue's just said, and she's one of the world's great reconcilers.  
**[0:43:06-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:43:06):**  And that's exactly what's needed in a situation such as this. And, you know, despite the fact  that my dad was a Freudian psychoanalyst, I clearly got some work to do on myself still  to vanquish my any I told you so tendencies that might pop up occasionally. But I do think  
**[0:43:23-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:43:23):**  there is, you know, I think it's Lawrence Woodward who once said, quoted an old proverb  to me, he who sits on fence gets splintered up arse. And I think that reconciliation is  crucial. But we need to make sure that we're not just papering over cracks. If there's  
**[0:43:39-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:43:39):**  an issue of substance that still needs to be resolved, and I think there are one or  two within the NGO community. And I don't think we need to throw rocks at each other  at all the reverse. And I think that if we can meet in the right spirit, we can perhaps  
**[0:43:55-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:43:55):**  work through some of these things together. But I think to pretend that there's just a  complete consensus is slightly to overlook some of the reasons which provoked this whole  conversation because we're not there yet as we well know as a result of the COP26 failure  
**[0:44:11-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Good-COP--Bad-COP-e1baoo3#t=0:44:11):**  to include agriculture and food on the agenda.  Thank you both. That's been fascinating. As always, that is all we have time for. I'd  like to thank my guests, Sue Pritchard and Patrick Holden. If you've enjoyed listening,

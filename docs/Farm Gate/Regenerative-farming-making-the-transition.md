### Farm Gate  (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 09:36:53)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to FarmGate. Our strapline is Practical Solutions for Climate and Food  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:11):**  Security. Well, today we're getting down to the practical solutions, and we're looking  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:15):**  at how farmers can make the transition to regenerative agriculture. I'm joined by  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:21):**  Claire Hill, who is the Farm Manager at FAI Farms, just outside Oxford, and by Caroline  
**[0:00:27-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:27):**  Grindrod, who is a regenerative farmer, and her consultancy website is rootsofnature.co.uk.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:34):**  And Caroline, you're advising Claire and FAI on how to make this regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:41):**  But Claire, I wonder if I can sort of come to you first. What is FAI Farm? What kind  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:46):**  of farm are you? Can you kind of describe what people would see on the ground if they  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:52):**  walked on a footpath across the fields there?  
**[0:00:54-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:54):**  Yes, I can. Yeah, we're 1200 acres in total, a livestock farm predominantly. We historically  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:01):**  have grown a small amount of cereals, but actually as part of this process for a while,  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:05):**  we're going to have a break from that so we can really focus on the livestock side of  
**[0:01:09-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:09):**  things. We're a beef and sheep farm, very traditional in many senses. We've got 70 head  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:17):**  satchel cows, which is growing, and a sheep flock of 380 ewes at the moment, which is  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:24):**  shrinking. But that's all kind of part of our decision making process, which I guess  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:28):**  we'll explain more in a minute.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:29):**  Who are your customers?  
**[0:01:32-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:32):**  We sell everything. So we finish everything ourselves. We're a breeder finisher operation,  
**[0:01:35-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:35):**  I guess, and we sell everything direct to sorta into the main abattoirs, supplying the  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:42):**  supermarket. So we're a M&S and Sainsbury's approved farm for supplying beef and beef  
**[0:01:47-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:47):**  and lamb. We also have a small organic laying hen unit. We've got 1,200 hens, we supply  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:54):**  eggs into local delis and restaurants into Oxford.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:59):**  So in terms of, you know, when you've made that transition, or as you're making that  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:02):**  transition, in terms of bringing customers with you, I guess the bigger opportunity actually  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:08):**  is with eggs where you can engage directly with delis and that sort of thing and sell  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:12):**  and brand eggs in the way that you want to, but there's less capacity for doing that with  
**[0:02:16-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:16):**  the beef cattle and the sheep.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:19):**  Well, we are looking at, so I guess for us, there's two different customer streams. There's  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:26):**  developing a market for regeneratively raised animals through the existing supply chain.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:31):**  So there's definite interest from the larger outlets, the supermarkets, restaurant chains,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:36):**  etc in regenerative farming, but there's not enough volume of product at the moment to  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:41):**  make that a viable supply chain. So that's one area that we want to kind of stay close  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:44):**  to and work on. But at the same time, there's huge interest from people, citizens out there  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:49):**  wanting to buy meat from a system that is putting back more than it takes out, is actually  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:54):**  helping with cooling the climate rather than warming it. And so we're exploring those options  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:59):**  as well. And then through our, being close to Oxford with Oxford University and through  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:06):**  our egg customers, then we're going to start exploring whether there's an opportunity to  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:11):**  sell our meat through those channels as well.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:13):**  And so what I guess the main question, first question is why now? Why have you decided  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:18):**  now to become a regenerative farm where at the moment I believe you're organic?  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:23):**  Yeah, that's right. We are. We've been organic for 18 years, ever since FAI took over this  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:28):**  farm from the university. We farmed organically. And why now? I think it's been, strangely  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:35):**  two things have come together at once. Firstly, it's been an evolution for us as we've taken  
**[0:03:39-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:39):**  on board all the information that's been out there about more intensive grazing practices  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:43):**  and the benefit that can be had from better grazing. We've adopted many of those practices.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:49):**  We also a few, quite a few years back decided that with such a large proportion of the world's  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:55):**  grain being grown to be fed to animals, there's something that didn't sit right with us. So  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:01):**  we know that ruminants can survive without grain. So therefore we're going to try and  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:05):**  achieve that. And it's taken us a few years to get there. So this journey for us probably  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:08):**  started four or five years ago. But really it's really ramped up when we got savvy with  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:15):**  our grazing and our water infrastructure on the farm. And we've had to make lots of changes  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:20):**  like that. And then with going through that process, it's led us to start questioning  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:25):**  everything. So we questioned the things we've been doing. And we started asking ourselves  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:30):**  more questions about what we were doing. And that led us down this path. At the same time,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:33):**  of course, everybody's awareness is so much more present, including our own of the kind  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:39):**  of climate crisis that we're in. And so we've started to look at our own, as farmers coming  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:43):**  under such attack, rightly and wrongly, I guess, a lot wrongly. But it feels very, feels  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:49):**  very like a position of attack at the moment and feeling very enclosed. And it's about  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:53):**  trying, if we found something that we feel that we're like, we can be really excited  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:57):**  and positive and have a great story to tell that with with a system that does undoes or  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:04):**  does good in all the things that people are attacking us for at the moment, we're not  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:07):**  doing those things any longer or we're working towards not doing some of those things. So  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:12):**  it feels great and really empowering.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:14):**  Okay, so so let's, let's have a look at that, then unpack that slightly. If we can go to  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:19):**  Caroline, you are a regenerative farmer, you're a consultant around this. Lots of people will  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:25):**  have heard the term regenerative agriculture. But what does it really mean?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:29):**  Yeah, well, that is a this is something that's coming into question more and more because  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:33):**  we're all a little bit worried that it might start to get diluted. And it doesn't have  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:38):**  a there is no one definition of what regenerative agriculture is. So it is different things  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:43):**  to different people. And I think that is one of the things that Claire and I are discussing  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:46):**  quite a bit at the moment is how do we define it and make sure that we're aligned with the  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:50):**  right the right end of it, I suppose. And I think one of the Wikipedia, if you Google  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:55):**  up what regenerative agriculture is, it says it's a system of farming principles and practices  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:59):**  that increases biodiversity, enriches soils, improves watersheds, and enhances ecosystem  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:05):**  services. And absolutely, that encapsulates what it is for me. And it also I think, above  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:10):**  and beyond that, it's a completely different way of thinking about your role within the  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:16):**  ecosystem and your farm. And instead of thinking of you as the manager and the fact that you're,  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:22):**  you're sort of overseeing this, we really are sort of putting ourselves into the place  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:25):**  of being in the ecosystem with our animals. And so it's not about sort of separating nature  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:31):**  on one side of the fence, and then and then producing food on the other, we are part of  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:36):**  creating a healthy ecosystem. And if we do that right, every everything within that ecosystem  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:42):**  is more abundant and healthy, and we don't need as much input. And we can also pull hopefully  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:46):**  even increase the output. So it's coming from, yeah, it's a it's a thinking differently.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:53):**  It's definitely a systems thinking change. And it's very much about trying to help the  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:59):**  planet recover, whether it's carbon or better hydrological function, and improve watershed,  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:07):**  and certainly biodiversity, it's all of that. But there's lots of sort of fractions of regenerative  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:13):**  agriculture that are, you know, more focused on, you know, just addressing things with,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:18):**  you know, reseeding or just not ploughing as deep or whatever it happens to be. Now  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:22):**  that's, that's not a systems thinking approach difference. That's, that's really just trying  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:26):**  to damage things less. Now, that's not regenerative agriculture. But ultimately, I think a bit  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:29):**  like organic, a bit like a lot of these, you know, conservation farming, all of them, and  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:35):**  it means a lot of different things. It's very broad, and it can be very diluted.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:39):**  You mentioned organic there. And I think, you know, for a lot of people, you know, over  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:43):**  the last decade or two, we've been pointed towards organic, organic is the environmentally  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:48):**  friendly way to farm. But I wonder, it seems to me that, you know, if we're looking at  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:52):**  differences between different kinds of agriculture, we've got mainstream agriculture, and we're  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:56):**  familiar with, with the fact that, you know, there are lots of inputs, you know, fertilizers  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:02):**  and different things that go into mainstream agriculture and organic, it seems to me is  
**[0:08:07-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:07):**  a sort of is a variant on that it's it's sort of the best version of, of mainstream agriculture,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:15):**  but it's still sort of quite focused around the inputs, whereas it seems to me that regenerative  
**[0:08:19-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:19):**  agriculture is coming in in quite a different direction. It's a very different approach  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:24):**  around those ecosystem services that you were talking about.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:27):**  Yeah, that's right. So we tend to I mean, I generally use holistic management as my  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:31):**  framework for managing the complexity of transitioning to regenerative agriculture. It's one of the  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:36):**  tools that's available. And that's, you know, I am a accredited professional with with the  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:41):**  Savory Institute, but I broaden that out and use lots of different thoughts. And my background  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:47):**  brings lots of different elements to the table. But we essentially look at the the landscape  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:52):**  we're trying to manage to the four ecosystem processes we call it. So that's the water  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:56):**  cycle, the mineral cycle, community dynamics and energy flow. And each one of those, you  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:01):**  know, energy flows a lot about photosynthesis, how much can we capture sunlight and use energy  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:06):**  that's from the sun rather than fossil fuel energy? How can we use those plants to build  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:10):**  soil because essentially, that's what's driving carbon sequestration through the liquid carbon  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:15):**  pathway. Community dynamics is how do we get more complexity in the system. So we've got,  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:20):**  we're adding species all the time. And each one of the species has a different function  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:24):**  that helps, you know, get rid of the root cause of a lot of the things that we're dealing  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:27):**  with in agriculture. So a lot of the costly problems in agriculture, whether it's, you  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:33):**  know, worm burdens or pests in your crops or whatever it is, it's a symptom of a lack  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:37):**  of complexity. We've simplified that.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:39):**  Complexity is a funny word, isn't it? It can mean many things to many people. And it's,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:43):**  in some ways, it's quite a scary word. Is it, when you're adding complexity, is it complex?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:49):**  Is it difficult to do?  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:50):**  Well, this is why you need a different way of thinking about it, because ultimately,  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:54):**  it's ever changing and you can't pin it down. And in agriculture, we've liked to try and  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:58):**  turn our system into a machine that we can understand and get predictable results. But  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:03):**  that's not how nature works. So if we want to truly start to regenerate our ecosystem,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:09):**  which is ultimately what regenerative agriculture is, we need to learn to work with that complexity  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:13):**  and I suppose it means a few different things. Biodiversity, increase in moving parts and  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:19):**  just being able to work with the fact that it's ever changing and ever evolving is when  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:23):**  I'm talking about complexity. So in a, you know, an ecosystem, we want lots of different  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:29):**  plant species, we want lots of different insects, we want lots of different birds, and then  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:33):**  we want lots of different species of, or different operations within our agricultural system  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:37):**  to fit into that. And all of those elements will bring benefits, you know, just a simple  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:42):**  thing is things like problems with face flies in cattle, you know, well, if you lose all  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:48):**  your dung beetles, on the legs of the dung beetles get carried mites that eat the face  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:52):**  fly eggs. So everything keeps itself in balance when you've got lots of different, when you've  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:56):**  got biodiversity in the system. And if you start to simplify that down, then you get  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:00):**  all these problems occurring, but it's very hard to quantify in a sort of mechanistic  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:05):**  way. So this is why we need a whole different way of thinking about how to manage our land.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:10):**  And we always look at the root cause when you're dealing with a symptom and you keep  
**[0:11:13-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:13):**  getting the same problem in organic farming, sometimes you might say, Oh, let's find the  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:16):**  least damaging way of treating that symptom. But ultimately, what we're looking at in regenerative  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:21):**  agriculture is how do we stop that happening in the first place? And what what is out of  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:25):**  balance that's making that happen. So it's a very different way of thinking about it.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:29):**  So cause and not the symptom and Claire, we know you've talked a little bit about those  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:34):**  sort of global drivers, if you like wanting to do the best you can with the farm that  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:39):**  you have a because it's the right thing to do, but B because there's, there's public  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:43):**  pressure for farming to get better. So those are the global drivers, but but were there  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:48):**  on farm drivers as well with the things that you thought, well, actually, if I was farming  
**[0:11:52-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:52):**  in a different way, perhaps we'd we'd have a better, healthier farm with with better  
**[0:11:58-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:58):**  welfare, etc. Were there local reasons as well?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:01):**  The bait, the big one has been a sheep worm problem, actually. And we've been very proactive  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:07):**  in our worm management on the sheep and we do feed lead counting. We're constantly, you  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:12):**  know, we're looking at the products that we're using. We move them after we are moving them,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:18):**  making sure they're not regrazing after we've wormed them. Following all as much as possible,  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:23):**  we can follow following the right advice on keeping on top of on top of them. We're in  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:29):**  problem, but it's even been an organic system. It's it just seems to keep escalating. And  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:33):**  we've we've we've got now resistance to our yellow drenches, which are the ones that we  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:39):**  were relying on as an organic system because we're restricted on some of the others and  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:44):**  on the white, the white clear drenches. And that that was a kind of a sort of moment where  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:51):**  I kind of realised that we need to change because our vets are brilliant and supportive  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:56):**  and really good with ideas on different things. But the first port of call really in conversation  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:01):**  was, well, which drugs do we go to next? And I was just thinking, well, you know, fast  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:06):**  forward three years and we're in the same position. If other drugs is our only option,  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:10):**  we need to do something different. And at the same time, I've actually talked about  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:13):**  some different farms that had been putting animals on arable farms where there's been  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:19):**  no sheep on for years and years and they're going on and they're not having to worm tree  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:22):**  to tall. So I was like, OK, so it is possible to have sheep without worms. And how do we  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:28):**  achieve that here on a livestock farm, which has been heavily grazed with sheep for the  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:31):**  last 50 years? Because sheep are really important to us about bringing diversity to our farm.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:39):**  They bring us an additional income stream. We're a large proportion of the farm is a  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:42):**  floodplain and their light feet are really important for grazing that area of the farm.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:47):**  We can't really put cattle down there for a lot of the year. And therefore, you know,  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:51):**  sheep are the best thing to turn that into human food. So we wanted to. Yeah. So that  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:56):**  was the kind of the tipping point for us. And by thinking differently about how we manage  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:01):**  it, we're actually actually looking at it now and thinking, yeah, we you know, we might  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:04):**  just actually be able to do this. I didn't think it would be possible. But with a completely  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:08):**  restructured thought process about how we manage the groups of sheep and how we instead  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:13):**  of having different management groups, which would be best practice, you know, your fittest  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:17):**  animals going on to your best ground so that they finish quicker. And what we ended because  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:22):**  we were doing that and what we had was like nine different sheep groups across the farm,  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:26):**  all behind electric fence, all going on to fresh grazing every three days, which was  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:30):**  perfect from, you know, growth rate point of view. But it means that we've got sheep  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:34):**  circling around the farm the entire time. So there's no break in. There's no break in  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:39):**  in worm cycles. And especially with the changing climate, worm cycles do appear to be worms  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:44):**  appear to be evolving to circumnavigate what we traditionally would use to manage them.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:49):**  And secondly, we've basically got a man on the farm full time. And we've got both both  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:54):**  people on the farm or full time and full time electric fencing, basically trying to keep  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:59):**  all these different groups of sheep. So we're sort of like, okay, take a step back. How  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:02):**  do we rest? How do we what we need is to break this worm cycle. The longest amount of time  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:07):**  possible between one grazing and the next means that the worms have no host in between.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:12):**  And in order to do that, we need to mop all of our sheep up. So we use lambs, followers,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:17):**  finishing lambs, breeding lambs, the whole lot in one group. If we did that, that would  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:20):**  allow us to maximise the rest period we had because the sheep would be going all the way  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:26):**  around the farm and it would be a long time before they came back to field one again.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:29):**  When you say a long time, how long?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:31):**  Well, we sort of target ourselves with could we do it for a year? But could we break every  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:36):**  field and only be grazed once per year? And actually, that's that's probably not possible.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:40):**  And so it across the whole farm, but certainly where we've got the vulnerable animals like  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:45):**  the lambs, and that is what we're that's what we're aiming to do so that lambs will not  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:50):**  raise the same part of the field more than once.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:53):**  And that's enough time to break the worm cycle, is it?  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:55):**  It's certainly much better than what we have been doing. Yes. Yeah, it depends which worms  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:59):**  and we have multiple challenges with different worms. It depends which worms but and all  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:04):**  the worms behave differently. But the best thing we can do for all of them, because you  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:08):**  can it's really hard individually as a farmer. Anyway, maybe not everyone, but me, you get  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:12):**  really bogged down with, well, we've got the presence of homuncus this time and trochosongus  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:16):**  the next time and like how okay, so we need to do this and do that. And it's all different.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:20):**  But the one thing that's consistent is the longer that cycle, the less likely the worms  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:24):**  are to and you know, to be able to reinfect. That's what that's what we're aiming to achieve.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:29):**  And so presumably, that's that's, you know, quite a big programme of management where you're,  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:34):**  you're testing on a regular basis intervening on a regular basis, but also making decisions  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:38):**  about the way that you manage land and the interaction of the animals with the land so  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:42):**  that you can ultimately try and break that cycle and reduce the medications.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:46):**  Yeah, absolutely. So it will it will mean us having to think we're already having to  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:49):**  think differently. So like we mean that maybe our lambs won't finish quite as quickly, because  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:54):**  they're not on the absolute like rocket fuel of ground, but we'll maybe we won't have to  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:59):**  treat them. So therefore, we've we've saved ourselves a medication treatment in both in  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:03):**  time and energy into doing that treatment that giving the chemical itself, which is,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:08):**  as I'm learning more about it, understanding that that is probably interfering with the  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:13):**  cycles of other insects within the land that could be beneficial. And yeah, we reduce the  
**[0:17:18-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:18):**  amount the amount of treatments that we have to do. But we might mean that we're because  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:24):**  the sheep are not on always the most optimum piece of land from a sort of energy point  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:28):**  of view. So it's us having it's our mindset is my mindset me more than I would say, and  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:33):**  my team on the farm are probably more, more pushing me saying come on, we you know, it's  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:37):**  me that's having to like get my head around a different way of doing it because we've,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:41):**  you know, had best operated at best practice and follow the best advice that there's been.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:45):**  And so it's a real mindset change.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:47):**  Well, that was something I was going to ask you actually, I mean, you know, change is  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:50):**  always associated with risk, you know, there are risks with with anything and was everyone  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:55):**  enthusiastic on the on the farm about what you were proposing about this transition?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:01):**  Or were they dissenting voices as well?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:03):**  I think that actually, we've certainly some blank looks to start with, but we've because  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:09):**  it we've sort of evolved and evolved ourselves. It's actually been it's actually been okay  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:15):**  in the farm team are really, really up for it. I would say the more questions have come  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:19):**  from the more mature amongst us. And my seniors have been like, you can never out winter cattle  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:27):**  on that farm. We've been there for 20 years. It's never been possible before. Why is it  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:31):**  possible now? It's wetter now that it's ever been. And you'll never keep Salaires. That's  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:36):**  the cattle group we have behind an electric fence. And you'll need to have mains electric  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:40):**  all over the farm. And it's comments like that. Those are the things.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:44):**  And I'm hearing from you, even even as you say that, that there has been some hat eating  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:48):**  going on.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:49):**  Yes. Yeah, yeah, there has. Yeah, there has. And of course, it's not that that's the bit  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:53):**  you mentioned earlier, the word confidence. So, you know, we probably could have done  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:57):**  this if we would have done it a few years ago. But with with things like that, you think  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:00):**  like, yeah, you know, I can't take a risk. And we're doing these things. But the more  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:05):**  you investigate it and find other farmers that are doing it, who say, no, we've because  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:08):**  I thought, oh, you can't do it on this farm, it's heavy clay. And then you speak to other  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:11):**  farmers, well, we've got heavy clay and we're doing it. I know. OK, right. So maybe we can.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:14):**  So we've and then it's each decision you make that goes against the grain. You've just gained  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:18):**  more confidence. So the next time somebody tells you you can't do something. We have  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:22):**  a phrase here that we use now is not when somebody says you can't do that on this farm.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:26):**  We say, how can we do that on this farm? So nothing is alone now. And we explore, you  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:30):**  know, how can we achieve it? And now I have farms come to me say, but we've got heavy  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:35):**  clay and we can't do it on our farm. And I say, no, we thought that. But come and look  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:38):**  at ours and then they come and look. And then, yeah, everybody's surprised. It's a really  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:43):**  nice place to be. So, so, Caroline, if you were sort of talking to to Claire over the  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:49):**  last five years and you're looking at the farm system that existed at FAI and the transition  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:54):**  to what there is now and there will be in the future, what were the kind of when you're  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:58):**  sort of giving that advice, what are the kind of things that you're picking up on in practical  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:01):**  terms? What are you saying? What are you saying to people about what they'll be doing differently  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:06):**  in time to come? I think what's absolutely key is that it's there's no one system that's  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:11):**  going to fit everybody. Absolutely the opposite. Every environment's entirely different. And  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:17):**  we've got to bring the people element into this. People want different things. So, you  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:21):**  know, you really do have to fit it. It's not truly sustainable unless that family is doing  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:25):**  what they want to do and that's going to last long term. So we've got to really take a lot  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:29):**  more thought over that. So what we do is we always work on gathering all that together,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:34):**  looking at what the landscape is suited to. What do we want to produce for the food and  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:40):**  how does it practically fit in with the kind of the dynamics, the family or the team or  
**[0:20:43-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:43):**  whatever you're working with. And Claire and I and the team have been working together  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:47):**  for a while now just to really get that thought process going. There's a lot of brainstorming  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:51):**  around that. You know, you do need to go through some sort of training transition to really  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:56):**  start to think differently. So for me, one of the big factors is really becoming kind  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:01):**  of eco-literate, I suppose, is walking around looking at your farm in a different way and  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:05):**  starting to question, Claire said, you know, questioning yourself. That's really actually  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:10):**  a huge part of the process. So what I encourage people to do is, again, we talked about those  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:14):**  four ecosystem processes. You go out into the field, do some infiltration tests, get  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:18):**  to know how does your field infiltrate water compared to the hedgerow next to it. And why?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:25):**  Why is that? What's the soil structure? Do things like segmented dig holes, look at your  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:29):**  soil structure, work out what management's been resulting in what and why. Looking at  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:33):**  photosynthesis, you know, in the areas that are allowed to be rough for a little bit longer  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:38):**  and haven't been cut for silage in that edge, you know, how is that performing? You know,  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:42):**  and what does the soil look like? And what's the infiltration test like in those areas?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:46):**  And what could we do differently? And then I think the next key step that is always a  
**[0:21:50-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:50):**  problem because actually, you know, Claire nailed it, every farm I go on to and work  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:55):**  with, they'll say, we can't do that here. And it doesn't matter what you're saying to  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:59):**  them and where they are in the country. That is always the response, just about always.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:05):**  So everybody has a history of things not working. And then they just bin the whole thing on  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:10):**  the back of that. So what we've got to really start to do is break that down. And I think  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:14):**  the more people that get into regenerative, the better because we've got more examples.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:17):**  And it sounds like that's kind of a bit of a challenge because, I mean, obviously, every  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:21):**  farm is different and every farmer has a slightly different approach. But it feels like in mainstream  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:25):**  agriculture, you know, we've been sold formulas, you know, for different types of farm for  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:30):**  a very long time. Organic is a sort of formula that you can apply and then make your own.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:36):**  But when you're talking about regenerative agriculture and you're saying that every farm  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:40):**  is different and every farmer needs to find their own solution and look at their own land,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:44):**  that that's that sounds like it's it's a more difficult transition to to replicate across  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:51):**  the country because people really need to come to it with open, open arms, open minds,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:58):**  and with the capacity to really think about what they're doing and to listen to what they're  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:03):**  doing. Yeah, absolutely. And and that's why we've got to train the individual. So unlike,  
**[0:23:09-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:09):**  you know, in environmental farming, where you've got lots of prescriptions for managing  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:12):**  habitats in a particular way from, you know, natural England or in organic farming where  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:17):**  you're just not allowed to use this, you're not allowed to do that, but we can give you  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:19):**  a derivation for that. So it's prescriptive. And then when you're doing that, you are an  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:23):**  organic farmer. We're we're completely different. We train the individual. We try and get a  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:28):**  mindset shift to looking at the land differently. They're questioning what is the root cause  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:33):**  of that. And, you know, and I say you're looking through those four ecosystem processes everywhere  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:37):**  you go. So you start to understand what the land feedback you're getting from the land.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:41):**  And once you've trained that individual, then you start to just make decisions. And the  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:45):**  holistic management framework is one way of doing that. But there's lots of other people  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:48):**  doing different things. But ultimately, it is about trying to, I kind of call it 360  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:53):**  thinking. You sit down and you say, OK, well, if we have all these different groups of animals,  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:59):**  what are the consequences? And, you know, what if we did this? If we, you know, just  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:05):**  put everything into one mob, how would that improve things? And then what would that allow  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:08):**  us to do? So it's really just and then what are the social consequences of that? Can we  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:12):**  actually manage that within the people we've got on our team? You know, what's the impact  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:16):**  on animal health? Is that worth the risk? You know, is that going to reduce our finishing  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:20):**  time? Well, yeah, yes. But as Claire said, that's going to also really reduce the amount  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:24):**  of input costs we've got. And it's going to improve our soil health because we're not  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:27):**  killing insects. You know, so you really start to question around the environment, the people  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:32):**  and the economics of it, you know, because ultimately it's got to pay. So it's really  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:36):**  just starting to think those processes through. And as I say, testing, doing lots of tools  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:41):**  out in the field, understanding what's happening, getting in tune with your landscape, getting  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:45):**  the feedback from that landscape. But yeah, it's a huge shift. And in our work now, and  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:50):**  we Wilder Culture is a community interest company that we're running where we're joining  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:54):**  up with large scale landowners, mostly in the uplands. And we're sort of adapting regenerative  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:59):**  to the upland areas. We're doing like one to two year transitions. So they go through  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:04):**  an initial training, but then they have a support package, if you like, where we are  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:09):**  on, you know, available to chat through daily decisions. And we realize that's the key,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:14):**  the decisions day by day by day, need to be more holistic, more 360, thinking about the  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:19):**  root cause, and the impacts on those different elements. And as you say, that's a lot harder  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:24):**  to teach and understand. But ultimately, it's just far more successful in the end.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:29):**  Claire, what would you say have been the biggest challenges? I mean, you're you were saying  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:33):**  that your transition has has taken place or the mindset transition anyways, taken place  
**[0:25:39-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:39):**  over the last five years or so, that you've introduced change gradually across that time.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:47):**  Have there been particular challenges that you've had to overcome after mindset, then  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:52):**  there's the practical challenges. So our main change in the way that we've managed our grazing,  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:57):**  I guess, is, is, is moving to moving at your keeping animals behind electric fence, high  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:03):**  density of animals in a small area for a short period of time in order to extend the rest  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:08):**  periods, which we talked about, and also to have the kind of trampling effect and even  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:13):**  application of manure. And for us, the biggest challenge was water. So we've got water troughs  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:19):**  around the farm, some are from springs, some are some feed from the rivers. There's all  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:23):**  different summers from the mains. And because what we our area of land now actually covers  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:28):**  three different farms originally. So the water sources are all very different. And you're  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:33):**  on the floodplain, aren't you must have been really wet over the last few weeks. Yeah,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:38):**  it has. So we don't have animals out on the floodplain. We do have thankfully this sort  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:42):**  of high bit of land up under white and woods, which allows us to do the out wintering. And  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:47):**  but it was it was it was looking at that. And we had to get help with that because we  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:50):**  pondered on that for it. That's probably what delayed us for a couple of years. But how  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:54):**  in the world are we going to get water around the farm? And then we got we got some help  
**[0:26:59-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:59):**  and from James Daniel at Precision Grazing and he helped us. Right. Go round all your  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:06):**  water troughs and just pick one area of the farm, like one block. Go round to test all  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:10):**  the water troughs and see what the flow rate is. And we were blown away because it varied  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:15):**  so much. And so we picked the fastest flowing trough. And then we this this did require  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:20):**  some investment and was to buy water pipe. And we call it our north and south circular.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:26):**  So around that block of land, we have a pipe that goes around the north side and a pipe  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:29):**  that goes around the south side. And it means that, you know, circulates all the way around.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:33):**  It's fast flowing water because when you've got a lot of animals in a small area, those  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:37):**  slow filling troughs, they can't keep up with the water demand. But something interesting  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:41):**  has so that was our biggest thing. We needed to get fast flowing water to two big groups  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:45):**  of animals. So our north and south circular do that. But the other thing that's interesting  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:49):**  in an animal behaviour way that changes the way animals drink is that in the past, the  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:55):**  mob would move around a large, say, the group of animals would move around a large field  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:00):**  and and drink. And when they got to the trough, you know, all they decided to go drink, they'd  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:05):**  all drink at once. So you need a lot of water very quickly. But actually, when when they're  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:09):**  in a small space and they're never very far from a trough, they actually all drink individually  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:13):**  through the day. So the water demand actually hasn't been as much as we anticipated it to  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:18):**  be. But that that was that was one of our biggest kind of stalling factors that we just  
**[0:28:24-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:24):**  couldn't work out how to get going.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:27):**  And so and you work that out by taking a bit of advice, doing some measurements, take some  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:32):**  readings and then putting yourself in a position once you've got the information of being able  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:37):**  to understand what was necessary and moving moving ahead. Yeah, fantastic. And I'd like  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:41):**  to move on from you know, we talked a lot about, you know, why, why and what regenerative  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:47):**  agriculture is. And we've talked a little bit about the the changes that you've started  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:51):**  to make on the farm in Oxford, I'd like to move on just slightly to yield and the economic  
**[0:28:57-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:57):**  impact of of regenerative agriculture. I mean, my understanding is that if you're going from  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:03):**  mainstream to organic, then potentially you're going to see a decrease in yield, but you  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:09):**  may see, if you're lucky, an increase in profit because you're selling what you're selling  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:13):**  for a bit more money because there's that organic brand associated with it. How is yield  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:18):**  affected with regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:21):**  Well we're very early early in our journey. So it's hard to say but having spent the last  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:26):**  couple of days doing some very detailed grazing planning for this year, we can already see  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:30):**  that there's going to be there's definitely opportunities for this farm to be able to  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:34):**  hold more stock. And that that that was actually true a few years ago, we did some grazing  
**[0:29:39-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:39):**  planning then. But the problem was we didn't incorporate the out wintering element. So  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:45):**  that was part of what led us down this journey that we we we we realised we could hold more  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:49):**  animals on the farm, but we needed to put up a big shed to to be able to house them  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:54):**  over the winter. And we don't we're only six years left on our tenancy. I'm sure I'm hopeful  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:59):**  you know we're all in agreement that it will be extended. But it was a big risk for us  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:02):**  to take and also just justifying that capital on lots of concrete. And then of course all  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:07):**  the loaders and tractors and everything that go with it. And that was the other thing I  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:11):**  kind of like Bob moment. I think we've got to do this differently. So what we need to  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:14):**  be doing is moving animals out of the shed and calculating the number of animals we can  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:18):**  hold on the farm based on our out wintering. And so now even with that and even without  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:24):**  wintering now we realise that we can still hold more animals on the farm. But I think  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:27):**  our biggest I don't so we will be able to have a higher stocking density I'm sure I  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:32):**  don't know what that is yet. And so I can't give you a figure but where our profitability  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:36):**  as a farm I am confident will improve is in our reduced level of inputs. So we're less  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:44):**  straw in the sheds. We're going to have to make less silage because we're feeding out.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:49):**  So there's less tractor work in the winter. Less diesel not just the diesel that we're  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:54):**  using on a daily basis but that you know the embedded energy and carbon that goes into  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:57):**  building tractors etc in the first place. And our costs on running those we will hopefully  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:02):**  be able to have fewer machines. So our running costs will go down. Our treatment costs will  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:07):**  go down and on animals and as I talk about the wormers and other things. And also then  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:13):**  of course the time it takes to do all of those things. So that's potentially less straw less  
**[0:31:18-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:18):**  feed less diesel fewer machines as you go forward lower rates of medicine need and an  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:26):**  increased herd size. That's that's that sounds like it's a really positive story. Yes yeah  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:30):**  and the other the other final thing I guess on that yet which contributes to it is that  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:34):**  this is quite scary when you look at the number of animals that we will be running in one  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:38):**  group when we talk about running. The aim is to have one mob of cattle and one mob of  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:43):**  sheep practically at bulling times and different things that's not always possible. So it splits  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:47):**  down but it's certainly much fewer groups. And so the time taken to do the management  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:52):**  of the different groups as well will reduce. And so there can be more time spent with livestock  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:58):**  sort of out in the field and observing what's happening. And Humphrey who is our farm foreman  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:05):**  he's brilliant and he talks about feedback. He says you know the land tells you and the  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:09):**  animals tell you and that's what we haven't necessarily looked out for before with we've  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:13):**  been organic for a long time and we've ticked all the boxes and we've done all the stuff  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:17):**  but we've not maybe looked at what what our environment is telling us. And if you leave  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:22):**  the animals for two for an extra day on a piece of land that you shouldn't have done  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:25):**  that the land will tell you or if you've moved them off too quickly you will see that and  
**[0:32:29-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:29):**  it's all about feedback. So it gives us more time to focus on that which will allow us  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:33):**  to make quicker gains. And because you've been farming in and because you're farming  
**[0:32:37-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:37):**  in the way that you are you're also contributing to and seeing a restoration of nature a regeneration  
**[0:32:44-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:44):**  of nature around the farm and a is that correct and b are you also feeling that you're getting  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:51):**  additional carbon sequestration? Yeah well we're really early days but yes already Caroline's  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:58):**  my favourite phrase of hers is there's no such thing as waste so when we think about  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:03):**  long grass in fields and it's got away from us and maybe it's you know it's gone past  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:06):**  its optimum energy level but actually even if that is the case with the traditional way  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:13):**  of thinking but actually with the animals trample that in it's just trampling in to  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:17):**  build more soil. And so when we when we start thinking like that and then and seeing the  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:23):**  spread of manure and the trampling effect that the animals are having now on on small  
**[0:33:26-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:26):**  areas of the farm one by one and the rest times then yes are confident that we're going  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:34):**  to be much more carbon. And we did have one field as an experiment that we left ungrazed  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:39):**  we sort of grazed it for lambing time and then we left ungrazed all summer and loads  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:44):**  of species I say loads not quantify them but a number of species came up that we've not  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:49):**  seen on the farm before and so or certainly in recent years so we're really confident  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:55):**  that actually we've got a seed bank underground that will come if with more rest will come  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:00):**  to fruition and with more that will mean more species mean more soil biological activity  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:05):**  which means the ability to have more microbes and drag more material back down and a lot  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:10):**  more carbon in the soil. And more greater diversity of nutrition for the livestock as  
**[0:34:15-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:15):**  well coming through there. And will you be able as you go forward do you think to integrate  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:22):**  new trees agroforestry within that system as well is that something you're planning?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:27):**  Absolutely yeah and we're planning it because our initial planning of more agroforestry  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:32):**  came from wanting to provide more shade and shelter to the animals because as we are although  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:38):**  we're organic here we had some large fields that over the years I imagine were much smaller  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:42):**  but the hedges have come out you know for all the reasons we know but even here as one  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:47):**  of our high level stewardship schemes we had to take out a number of mature trees it seems  
**[0:34:52-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:52):**  crazy now only 10 years ago we were taking down mature trees to not allow corvids to  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:58):**  nest because we wanted to encourage ground nesting birds but in reality that fields on  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:01):**  a footpath and ground nesting birds were always going to be very unlikely. So all that yes  
**[0:35:06-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:06):**  it's amazing what we learn in a relatively short space of time so actually we need to  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:12):**  put back trees for those reasons but yeah into breaking our fields up into smaller areas  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:16):**  and providing shade and shelter through our larger fields and we'll look at what species  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:22):**  of tree that we use that could be maybe you know looking at fruit trees and other things  
**[0:35:27-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:27):**  that will provide a second harvest as well as just providing the carbon locking up of  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:35):**  trees and also helping with soil structure and ground water that we because we have obviously  
**[0:35:40-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:40):**  wet farming being on the flood plain.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:44):**  It's fascinating stuff and I think and hopefully we'll come back and talk about some of this  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:48):**  stuff again in the future but Caroline just on that sort of yield and economic impact  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:53):**  front I wonder if you could sort of comment generally about what you would expect from  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:58):**  regenerative systems in the UK and elsewhere in the world.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:01):**  Yeah absolutely I mean we mustn't forget that regenerative in the UK is pretty it's pretty  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:06):**  young still so there's many projects kind of in you know in the early stages and getting  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:11):**  great results and lots of people that are doing any sort of paddock grazing are seeing  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:14):**  an increase in yield almost immediately I'd say that's fair to say. I'm always a little  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:20):**  bit more cautious and some about you know you'll double your numbers and all the rest  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:24):**  of it I think in the UK we've always been quite highly stocked to start with. I think  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:29):**  the biggest opportunity is as we've just explained is getting rid of your input costs and then  
**[0:36:34-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:34):**  being better for the planet for the fact that you can reduce your carbon output and all  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:37):**  your costly output you know and your inputs you know sort of all the medications and everything  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:42):**  that Claire listed. That's a huge huge thing for farmers if you can be more profitable  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:47):**  and still produce the same amount of output then that's pretty good. And then I'm pretty  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:51):**  confident from the evidence that we've seen of the kind of the projects that are in early  
**[0:36:55-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:55):**  stages and from particularly from the people that are doing it really well across the world  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:01):**  in comparable places regions habitats and that we can definitely increase the productivity.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:06):**  I think in the uplands what we're finding with my wilde culture projects where you've  
**[0:37:10-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:10):**  got large areas of moorland and heath and things like that slightly different what we  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:14):**  can achieve there is definitely regeneration of the soil and the ecosystem and the biodiversity  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:20):**  and we certainly can maintain we hope productivity depending on the layout of the farm by you  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:27):**  know using the the heimatas and paddock grazing those in a way that's going to you know do  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:32):**  all the things that we've been talking about sequester carbon and increase output. But  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:36):**  on the upland areas there's not a lot of scope for increasing numbers up there but overall  
**[0:37:40-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:40):**  you just manage that you have to have a whole system redesign that's going to take out the  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:44):**  costs maintain numbers or yes slightly increase numbers.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:48):**  Well thank you very much both of you that's all we got time for in the autumn we'll try

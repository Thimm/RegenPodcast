**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to FarmGate. Our strapline is Practical Solutions for Climate and Food  Security. Well, today we're getting down to the practical solutions, and we're looking  at how farmers can make the transition to regenerative agriculture. I'm joined by  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:21):**  Claire Hill, who is the Farm Manager at FAI Farms, just outside Oxford, and by Caroline  Grindrod, who is a regenerative farmer, and her consultancy website is rootsofnature.co.uk.  And Caroline, you're advising Claire and FAI on how to make this regenerative transition.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:41):**  But Claire, I wonder if I can sort of come to you first. What is FAI Farm? What kind  of farm are you? Can you kind of describe what people would see on the ground if they  walked on a footpath across the fields there?  
**[0:00:54-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:00:54):**  Yes, I can. Yeah, we're 1200 acres in total, a livestock farm predominantly. We historically  have grown a small amount of cereals, but actually as part of this process for a while,  we're going to have a break from that so we can really focus on the livestock side of  
**[0:01:09-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:09):**  things. We're a beef and sheep farm, very traditional in many senses. We've got 70 head  satchel cows, which is growing, and a sheep flock of 380 ewes at the moment, which is  shrinking. But that's all kind of part of our decision making process, which I guess  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:28):**  we'll explain more in a minute.  Who are your customers?  We sell everything. So we finish everything ourselves. We're a breeder finisher operation,  
**[0:01:35-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:35):**  I guess, and we sell everything direct to sorta into the main abattoirs, supplying the  supermarket. So we're a M&S and Sainsbury's approved farm for supplying beef and beef  and lamb. We also have a small organic laying hen unit. We've got 1,200 hens, we supply  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:01:54):**  eggs into local delis and restaurants into Oxford.  So in terms of, you know, when you've made that transition, or as you're making that  transition, in terms of bringing customers with you, I guess the bigger opportunity actually  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:08):**  is with eggs where you can engage directly with delis and that sort of thing and sell  and brand eggs in the way that you want to, but there's less capacity for doing that with  the beef cattle and the sheep.  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:19):**  Well, we are looking at, so I guess for us, there's two different customer streams. There's  developing a market for regeneratively raised animals through the existing supply chain.  So there's definite interest from the larger outlets, the supermarkets, restaurant chains,  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:36):**  etc in regenerative farming, but there's not enough volume of product at the moment to  make that a viable supply chain. So that's one area that we want to kind of stay close  to and work on. But at the same time, there's huge interest from people, citizens out there  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:02:49):**  wanting to buy meat from a system that is putting back more than it takes out, is actually  helping with cooling the climate rather than warming it. And so we're exploring those options  as well. And then through our, being close to Oxford with Oxford University and through  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:06):**  our egg customers, then we're going to start exploring whether there's an opportunity to  sell our meat through those channels as well.  And so what I guess the main question, first question is why now? Why have you decided  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:18):**  now to become a regenerative farm where at the moment I believe you're organic?  Yeah, that's right. We are. We've been organic for 18 years, ever since FAI took over this  farm from the university. We farmed organically. And why now? I think it's been, strangely  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:35):**  two things have come together at once. Firstly, it's been an evolution for us as we've taken  on board all the information that's been out there about more intensive grazing practices  and the benefit that can be had from better grazing. We've adopted many of those practices.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:03:49):**  We also a few, quite a few years back decided that with such a large proportion of the world's  grain being grown to be fed to animals, there's something that didn't sit right with us. So  we know that ruminants can survive without grain. So therefore we're going to try and  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:05):**  achieve that. And it's taken us a few years to get there. So this journey for us probably  started four or five years ago. But really it's really ramped up when we got savvy with  our grazing and our water infrastructure on the farm. And we've had to make lots of changes  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:20):**  like that. And then with going through that process, it's led us to start questioning  everything. So we questioned the things we've been doing. And we started asking ourselves  more questions about what we were doing. And that led us down this path. At the same time,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:33):**  of course, everybody's awareness is so much more present, including our own of the kind  of climate crisis that we're in. And so we've started to look at our own, as farmers coming  under such attack, rightly and wrongly, I guess, a lot wrongly. But it feels very, feels  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:04:49):**  very like a position of attack at the moment and feeling very enclosed. And it's about  trying, if we found something that we feel that we're like, we can be really excited  and positive and have a great story to tell that with with a system that does undoes or  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:04):**  does good in all the things that people are attacking us for at the moment, we're not  doing those things any longer or we're working towards not doing some of those things. So  it feels great and really empowering.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:14):**  Okay, so so let's, let's have a look at that, then unpack that slightly. If we can go to  Caroline, you are a regenerative farmer, you're a consultant around this. Lots of people will  have heard the term regenerative agriculture. But what does it really mean?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:29):**  Yeah, well, that is a this is something that's coming into question more and more because  we're all a little bit worried that it might start to get diluted. And it doesn't have  a there is no one definition of what regenerative agriculture is. So it is different things  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:43):**  to different people. And I think that is one of the things that Claire and I are discussing  quite a bit at the moment is how do we define it and make sure that we're aligned with the  right the right end of it, I suppose. And I think one of the Wikipedia, if you Google  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:05:55):**  up what regenerative agriculture is, it says it's a system of farming principles and practices  that increases biodiversity, enriches soils, improves watersheds, and enhances ecosystem  services. And absolutely, that encapsulates what it is for me. And it also I think, above  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:10):**  and beyond that, it's a completely different way of thinking about your role within the  ecosystem and your farm. And instead of thinking of you as the manager and the fact that you're,  you're sort of overseeing this, we really are sort of putting ourselves into the place  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:25):**  of being in the ecosystem with our animals. And so it's not about sort of separating nature  on one side of the fence, and then and then producing food on the other, we are part of  creating a healthy ecosystem. And if we do that right, every everything within that ecosystem  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:42):**  is more abundant and healthy, and we don't need as much input. And we can also pull hopefully  even increase the output. So it's coming from, yeah, it's a it's a thinking differently.  It's definitely a systems thinking change. And it's very much about trying to help the  
**[0:06:59-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:06:59):**  planet recover, whether it's carbon or better hydrological function, and improve watershed,  and certainly biodiversity, it's all of that. But there's lots of sort of fractions of regenerative  agriculture that are, you know, more focused on, you know, just addressing things with,  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:18):**  you know, reseeding or just not ploughing as deep or whatever it happens to be. Now  that's, that's not a systems thinking approach difference. That's, that's really just trying  to damage things less. Now, that's not regenerative agriculture. But ultimately, I think a bit  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:29):**  like organic, a bit like a lot of these, you know, conservation farming, all of them, and  it means a lot of different things. It's very broad, and it can be very diluted.  You mentioned organic there. And I think, you know, for a lot of people, you know, over  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:43):**  the last decade or two, we've been pointed towards organic, organic is the environmentally  friendly way to farm. But I wonder, it seems to me that, you know, if we're looking at  differences between different kinds of agriculture, we've got mainstream agriculture, and we're  
**[0:07:56-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:07:56):**  familiar with, with the fact that, you know, there are lots of inputs, you know, fertilizers  and different things that go into mainstream agriculture and organic, it seems to me is  a sort of is a variant on that it's it's sort of the best version of, of mainstream agriculture,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:15):**  but it's still sort of quite focused around the inputs, whereas it seems to me that regenerative  agriculture is coming in in quite a different direction. It's a very different approach  around those ecosystem services that you were talking about.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:27):**  Yeah, that's right. So we tend to I mean, I generally use holistic management as my  framework for managing the complexity of transitioning to regenerative agriculture. It's one of the  tools that's available. And that's, you know, I am a accredited professional with with the  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:41):**  Savory Institute, but I broaden that out and use lots of different thoughts. And my background  brings lots of different elements to the table. But we essentially look at the the landscape  we're trying to manage to the four ecosystem processes we call it. So that's the water  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:08:56):**  cycle, the mineral cycle, community dynamics and energy flow. And each one of those, you  know, energy flows a lot about photosynthesis, how much can we capture sunlight and use energy  that's from the sun rather than fossil fuel energy? How can we use those plants to build  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:10):**  soil because essentially, that's what's driving carbon sequestration through the liquid carbon  pathway. Community dynamics is how do we get more complexity in the system. So we've got,  we're adding species all the time. And each one of the species has a different function  
**[0:09:24-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:24):**  that helps, you know, get rid of the root cause of a lot of the things that we're dealing  with in agriculture. So a lot of the costly problems in agriculture, whether it's, you  know, worm burdens or pests in your crops or whatever it is, it's a symptom of a lack  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:37):**  of complexity. We've simplified that.  Complexity is a funny word, isn't it? It can mean many things to many people. And it's,  in some ways, it's quite a scary word. Is it, when you're adding complexity, is it complex?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:49):**  Is it difficult to do?  Well, this is why you need a different way of thinking about it, because ultimately,  it's ever changing and you can't pin it down. And in agriculture, we've liked to try and  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:09:58):**  turn our system into a machine that we can understand and get predictable results. But  that's not how nature works. So if we want to truly start to regenerate our ecosystem,  which is ultimately what regenerative agriculture is, we need to learn to work with that complexity  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:13):**  and I suppose it means a few different things. Biodiversity, increase in moving parts and  just being able to work with the fact that it's ever changing and ever evolving is when  I'm talking about complexity. So in a, you know, an ecosystem, we want lots of different  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:29):**  plant species, we want lots of different insects, we want lots of different birds, and then  we want lots of different species of, or different operations within our agricultural system  to fit into that. And all of those elements will bring benefits, you know, just a simple  
**[0:10:42-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:42):**  thing is things like problems with face flies in cattle, you know, well, if you lose all  your dung beetles, on the legs of the dung beetles get carried mites that eat the face  fly eggs. So everything keeps itself in balance when you've got lots of different, when you've  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:10:56):**  got biodiversity in the system. And if you start to simplify that down, then you get  all these problems occurring, but it's very hard to quantify in a sort of mechanistic  way. So this is why we need a whole different way of thinking about how to manage our land.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:10):**  And we always look at the root cause when you're dealing with a symptom and you keep  getting the same problem in organic farming, sometimes you might say, Oh, let's find the  least damaging way of treating that symptom. But ultimately, what we're looking at in regenerative  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:21):**  agriculture is how do we stop that happening in the first place? And what what is out of  balance that's making that happen. So it's a very different way of thinking about it.  So cause and not the symptom and Claire, we know you've talked a little bit about those  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:34):**  sort of global drivers, if you like wanting to do the best you can with the farm that  you have a because it's the right thing to do, but B because there's, there's public  pressure for farming to get better. So those are the global drivers, but but were there  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:11:48):**  on farm drivers as well with the things that you thought, well, actually, if I was farming  in a different way, perhaps we'd we'd have a better, healthier farm with with better  welfare, etc. Were there local reasons as well?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:01):**  The bait, the big one has been a sheep worm problem, actually. And we've been very proactive  in our worm management on the sheep and we do feed lead counting. We're constantly, you  know, we're looking at the products that we're using. We move them after we are moving them,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:18):**  making sure they're not regrazing after we've wormed them. Following all as much as possible,  we can follow following the right advice on keeping on top of on top of them. We're in  problem, but it's even been an organic system. It's it just seems to keep escalating. And  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:33):**  we've we've we've got now resistance to our yellow drenches, which are the ones that we  were relying on as an organic system because we're restricted on some of the others and  on the white, the white clear drenches. And that that was a kind of a sort of moment where  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:12:51):**  I kind of realised that we need to change because our vets are brilliant and supportive  and really good with ideas on different things. But the first port of call really in conversation  was, well, which drugs do we go to next? And I was just thinking, well, you know, fast  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:06):**  forward three years and we're in the same position. If other drugs is our only option,  we need to do something different. And at the same time, I've actually talked about  some different farms that had been putting animals on arable farms where there's been  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:19):**  no sheep on for years and years and they're going on and they're not having to worm tree  to tall. So I was like, OK, so it is possible to have sheep without worms. And how do we  achieve that here on a livestock farm, which has been heavily grazed with sheep for the  
**[0:13:31-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:31):**  last 50 years? Because sheep are really important to us about bringing diversity to our farm.  They bring us an additional income stream. We're a large proportion of the farm is a  floodplain and their light feet are really important for grazing that area of the farm.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:13:47):**  We can't really put cattle down there for a lot of the year. And therefore, you know,  sheep are the best thing to turn that into human food. So we wanted to. Yeah. So that  was the kind of the tipping point for us. And by thinking differently about how we manage  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:01):**  it, we're actually actually looking at it now and thinking, yeah, we you know, we might  just actually be able to do this. I didn't think it would be possible. But with a completely  restructured thought process about how we manage the groups of sheep and how we instead  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:13):**  of having different management groups, which would be best practice, you know, your fittest  animals going on to your best ground so that they finish quicker. And what we ended because  we were doing that and what we had was like nine different sheep groups across the farm,  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:26):**  all behind electric fence, all going on to fresh grazing every three days, which was  perfect from, you know, growth rate point of view. But it means that we've got sheep  circling around the farm the entire time. So there's no break in. There's no break in  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:39):**  in worm cycles. And especially with the changing climate, worm cycles do appear to be worms  appear to be evolving to circumnavigate what we traditionally would use to manage them.  And secondly, we've basically got a man on the farm full time. And we've got both both  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:14:54):**  people on the farm or full time and full time electric fencing, basically trying to keep  all these different groups of sheep. So we're sort of like, okay, take a step back. How  do we rest? How do we what we need is to break this worm cycle. The longest amount of time  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:07):**  possible between one grazing and the next means that the worms have no host in between.  And in order to do that, we need to mop all of our sheep up. So we use lambs, followers,  finishing lambs, breeding lambs, the whole lot in one group. If we did that, that would  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:20):**  allow us to maximise the rest period we had because the sheep would be going all the way  around the farm and it would be a long time before they came back to field one again.  When you say a long time, how long?  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:31):**  Well, we sort of target ourselves with could we do it for a year? But could we break every  field and only be grazed once per year? And actually, that's that's probably not possible.  And so it across the whole farm, but certainly where we've got the vulnerable animals like  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:45):**  the lambs, and that is what we're that's what we're aiming to do so that lambs will not  raise the same part of the field more than once.  And that's enough time to break the worm cycle, is it?  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:15:55):**  It's certainly much better than what we have been doing. Yes. Yeah, it depends which worms  and we have multiple challenges with different worms. It depends which worms but and all  the worms behave differently. But the best thing we can do for all of them, because you  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:08):**  can it's really hard individually as a farmer. Anyway, maybe not everyone, but me, you get  really bogged down with, well, we've got the presence of homuncus this time and trochosongus  the next time and like how okay, so we need to do this and do that. And it's all different.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:20):**  But the one thing that's consistent is the longer that cycle, the less likely the worms  are to and you know, to be able to reinfect. That's what that's what we're aiming to achieve.  And so presumably, that's that's, you know, quite a big programme of management where you're,  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:34):**  you're testing on a regular basis intervening on a regular basis, but also making decisions  about the way that you manage land and the interaction of the animals with the land so  that you can ultimately try and break that cycle and reduce the medications.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:46):**  Yeah, absolutely. So it will it will mean us having to think we're already having to  think differently. So like we mean that maybe our lambs won't finish quite as quickly, because  they're not on the absolute like rocket fuel of ground, but we'll maybe we won't have to  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:16:59):**  treat them. So therefore, we've we've saved ourselves a medication treatment in both in  time and energy into doing that treatment that giving the chemical itself, which is,  as I'm learning more about it, understanding that that is probably interfering with the  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:13):**  cycles of other insects within the land that could be beneficial. And yeah, we reduce the  amount the amount of treatments that we have to do. But we might mean that we're because  the sheep are not on always the most optimum piece of land from a sort of energy point  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:28):**  of view. So it's us having it's our mindset is my mindset me more than I would say, and  my team on the farm are probably more, more pushing me saying come on, we you know, it's  me that's having to like get my head around a different way of doing it because we've,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:41):**  you know, had best operated at best practice and follow the best advice that there's been.  And so it's a real mindset change.  Well, that was something I was going to ask you actually, I mean, you know, change is  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:17:50):**  always associated with risk, you know, there are risks with with anything and was everyone  enthusiastic on the on the farm about what you were proposing about this transition?  Or were they dissenting voices as well?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:03):**  I think that actually, we've certainly some blank looks to start with, but we've because  it we've sort of evolved and evolved ourselves. It's actually been it's actually been okay  in the farm team are really, really up for it. I would say the more questions have come  
**[0:18:19-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:19):**  from the more mature amongst us. And my seniors have been like, you can never out winter cattle  on that farm. We've been there for 20 years. It's never been possible before. Why is it  possible now? It's wetter now that it's ever been. And you'll never keep Salaires. That's  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:36):**  the cattle group we have behind an electric fence. And you'll need to have mains electric  all over the farm. And it's comments like that. Those are the things.  And I'm hearing from you, even even as you say that, that there has been some hat eating  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:48):**  going on.  Yes. Yeah, yeah, there has. Yeah, there has. And of course, it's not that that's the bit  you mentioned earlier, the word confidence. So, you know, we probably could have done  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:18:57):**  this if we would have done it a few years ago. But with with things like that, you think  like, yeah, you know, I can't take a risk. And we're doing these things. But the more  you investigate it and find other farmers that are doing it, who say, no, we've because  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:08):**  I thought, oh, you can't do it on this farm, it's heavy clay. And then you speak to other  farmers, well, we've got heavy clay and we're doing it. I know. OK, right. So maybe we can.  So we've and then it's each decision you make that goes against the grain. You've just gained  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:18):**  more confidence. So the next time somebody tells you you can't do something. We have  a phrase here that we use now is not when somebody says you can't do that on this farm.  We say, how can we do that on this farm? So nothing is alone now. And we explore, you  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:30):**  know, how can we achieve it? And now I have farms come to me say, but we've got heavy  clay and we can't do it on our farm. And I say, no, we thought that. But come and look  at ours and then they come and look. And then, yeah, everybody's surprised. It's a really  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:43):**  nice place to be. So, so, Caroline, if you were sort of talking to to Claire over the  last five years and you're looking at the farm system that existed at FAI and the transition  to what there is now and there will be in the future, what were the kind of when you're  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:19:58):**  sort of giving that advice, what are the kind of things that you're picking up on in practical  terms? What are you saying? What are you saying to people about what they'll be doing differently  in time to come? I think what's absolutely key is that it's there's no one system that's  
**[0:20:11-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:11):**  going to fit everybody. Absolutely the opposite. Every environment's entirely different. And  we've got to bring the people element into this. People want different things. So, you  know, you really do have to fit it. It's not truly sustainable unless that family is doing  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:25):**  what they want to do and that's going to last long term. So we've got to really take a lot  more thought over that. So what we do is we always work on gathering all that together,  looking at what the landscape is suited to. What do we want to produce for the food and  
**[0:20:40-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:40):**  how does it practically fit in with the kind of the dynamics, the family or the team or  whatever you're working with. And Claire and I and the team have been working together  for a while now just to really get that thought process going. There's a lot of brainstorming  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:20:51):**  around that. You know, you do need to go through some sort of training transition to really  start to think differently. So for me, one of the big factors is really becoming kind  of eco-literate, I suppose, is walking around looking at your farm in a different way and  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:05):**  starting to question, Claire said, you know, questioning yourself. That's really actually  a huge part of the process. So what I encourage people to do is, again, we talked about those  four ecosystem processes. You go out into the field, do some infiltration tests, get  
**[0:21:18-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:18):**  to know how does your field infiltrate water compared to the hedgerow next to it. And why?  Why is that? What's the soil structure? Do things like segmented dig holes, look at your  soil structure, work out what management's been resulting in what and why. Looking at  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:33):**  photosynthesis, you know, in the areas that are allowed to be rough for a little bit longer  and haven't been cut for silage in that edge, you know, how is that performing? You know,  and what does the soil look like? And what's the infiltration test like in those areas?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:46):**  And what could we do differently? And then I think the next key step that is always a  problem because actually, you know, Claire nailed it, every farm I go on to and work  with, they'll say, we can't do that here. And it doesn't matter what you're saying to  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:21:59):**  them and where they are in the country. That is always the response, just about always.  So everybody has a history of things not working. And then they just bin the whole thing on  the back of that. So what we've got to really start to do is break that down. And I think  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:14):**  the more people that get into regenerative, the better because we've got more examples.  And it sounds like that's kind of a bit of a challenge because, I mean, obviously, every  farm is different and every farmer has a slightly different approach. But it feels like in mainstream  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:25):**  agriculture, you know, we've been sold formulas, you know, for different types of farm for  a very long time. Organic is a sort of formula that you can apply and then make your own.  But when you're talking about regenerative agriculture and you're saying that every farm  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:40):**  is different and every farmer needs to find their own solution and look at their own land,  that that's that sounds like it's it's a more difficult transition to to replicate across  the country because people really need to come to it with open, open arms, open minds,  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:22:58):**  and with the capacity to really think about what they're doing and to listen to what they're  doing. Yeah, absolutely. And and that's why we've got to train the individual. So unlike,  you know, in environmental farming, where you've got lots of prescriptions for managing  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:12):**  habitats in a particular way from, you know, natural England or in organic farming where  you're just not allowed to use this, you're not allowed to do that, but we can give you  a derivation for that. So it's prescriptive. And then when you're doing that, you are an  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:23):**  organic farmer. We're we're completely different. We train the individual. We try and get a  mindset shift to looking at the land differently. They're questioning what is the root cause  of that. And, you know, and I say you're looking through those four ecosystem processes everywhere  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:37):**  you go. So you start to understand what the land feedback you're getting from the land.  And once you've trained that individual, then you start to just make decisions. And the  holistic management framework is one way of doing that. But there's lots of other people  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:23:48):**  doing different things. But ultimately, it is about trying to, I kind of call it 360  thinking. You sit down and you say, OK, well, if we have all these different groups of animals,  what are the consequences? And, you know, what if we did this? If we, you know, just  
**[0:24:05-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:05):**  put everything into one mob, how would that improve things? And then what would that allow  us to do? So it's really just and then what are the social consequences of that? Can we  actually manage that within the people we've got on our team? You know, what's the impact  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:16):**  on animal health? Is that worth the risk? You know, is that going to reduce our finishing  time? Well, yeah, yes. But as Claire said, that's going to also really reduce the amount  of input costs we've got. And it's going to improve our soil health because we're not  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:27):**  killing insects. You know, so you really start to question around the environment, the people  and the economics of it, you know, because ultimately it's got to pay. So it's really  just starting to think those processes through. And as I say, testing, doing lots of tools  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:41):**  out in the field, understanding what's happening, getting in tune with your landscape, getting  the feedback from that landscape. But yeah, it's a huge shift. And in our work now, and  we Wilder Culture is a community interest company that we're running where we're joining  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:24:54):**  up with large scale landowners, mostly in the uplands. And we're sort of adapting regenerative  to the upland areas. We're doing like one to two year transitions. So they go through  an initial training, but then they have a support package, if you like, where we are  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:09):**  on, you know, available to chat through daily decisions. And we realize that's the key,  the decisions day by day by day, need to be more holistic, more 360, thinking about the  root cause, and the impacts on those different elements. And as you say, that's a lot harder  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:24):**  to teach and understand. But ultimately, it's just far more successful in the end.  Claire, what would you say have been the biggest challenges? I mean, you're you were saying  that your transition has has taken place or the mindset transition anyways, taken place  
**[0:25:39-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:39):**  over the last five years or so, that you've introduced change gradually across that time.  Have there been particular challenges that you've had to overcome after mindset, then  there's the practical challenges. So our main change in the way that we've managed our grazing,  
**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:25:57):**  I guess, is, is, is moving to moving at your keeping animals behind electric fence, high  density of animals in a small area for a short period of time in order to extend the rest  periods, which we talked about, and also to have the kind of trampling effect and even  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:13):**  application of manure. And for us, the biggest challenge was water. So we've got water troughs  around the farm, some are from springs, some are some feed from the rivers. There's all  different summers from the mains. And because what we our area of land now actually covers  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:28):**  three different farms originally. So the water sources are all very different. And you're  on the floodplain, aren't you must have been really wet over the last few weeks. Yeah,  it has. So we don't have animals out on the floodplain. We do have thankfully this sort  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:42):**  of high bit of land up under white and woods, which allows us to do the out wintering. And  but it was it was it was looking at that. And we had to get help with that because we  pondered on that for it. That's probably what delayed us for a couple of years. But how  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:26:54):**  in the world are we going to get water around the farm? And then we got we got some help  and from James Daniel at Precision Grazing and he helped us. Right. Go round all your  water troughs and just pick one area of the farm, like one block. Go round to test all  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:10):**  the water troughs and see what the flow rate is. And we were blown away because it varied  so much. And so we picked the fastest flowing trough. And then we this this did require  some investment and was to buy water pipe. And we call it our north and south circular.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:26):**  So around that block of land, we have a pipe that goes around the north side and a pipe  that goes around the south side. And it means that, you know, circulates all the way around.  It's fast flowing water because when you've got a lot of animals in a small area, those  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:37):**  slow filling troughs, they can't keep up with the water demand. But something interesting  has so that was our biggest thing. We needed to get fast flowing water to two big groups  of animals. So our north and south circular do that. But the other thing that's interesting  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:27:49):**  in an animal behaviour way that changes the way animals drink is that in the past, the  mob would move around a large, say, the group of animals would move around a large field  and and drink. And when they got to the trough, you know, all they decided to go drink, they'd  
**[0:28:05-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:05):**  all drink at once. So you need a lot of water very quickly. But actually, when when they're  in a small space and they're never very far from a trough, they actually all drink individually  through the day. So the water demand actually hasn't been as much as we anticipated it to  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:18):**  be. But that that was that was one of our biggest kind of stalling factors that we just  couldn't work out how to get going.  And so and you work that out by taking a bit of advice, doing some measurements, take some  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:32):**  readings and then putting yourself in a position once you've got the information of being able  to understand what was necessary and moving moving ahead. Yeah, fantastic. And I'd like  to move on from you know, we talked a lot about, you know, why, why and what regenerative  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:28:47):**  agriculture is. And we've talked a little bit about the the changes that you've started  to make on the farm in Oxford, I'd like to move on just slightly to yield and the economic  impact of of regenerative agriculture. I mean, my understanding is that if you're going from  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:03):**  mainstream to organic, then potentially you're going to see a decrease in yield, but you  may see, if you're lucky, an increase in profit because you're selling what you're selling  for a bit more money because there's that organic brand associated with it. How is yield  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:18):**  affected with regenerative agriculture?  Well we're very early early in our journey. So it's hard to say but having spent the last  couple of days doing some very detailed grazing planning for this year, we can already see  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:30):**  that there's going to be there's definitely opportunities for this farm to be able to  hold more stock. And that that that was actually true a few years ago, we did some grazing  planning then. But the problem was we didn't incorporate the out wintering element. So  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:45):**  that was part of what led us down this journey that we we we we realised we could hold more  animals on the farm, but we needed to put up a big shed to to be able to house them  over the winter. And we don't we're only six years left on our tenancy. I'm sure I'm hopeful  
**[0:29:59-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:29:59):**  you know we're all in agreement that it will be extended. But it was a big risk for us  to take and also just justifying that capital on lots of concrete. And then of course all  the loaders and tractors and everything that go with it. And that was the other thing I  
**[0:30:11-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:11):**  kind of like Bob moment. I think we've got to do this differently. So what we need to  be doing is moving animals out of the shed and calculating the number of animals we can  hold on the farm based on our out wintering. And so now even with that and even without  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:24):**  wintering now we realise that we can still hold more animals on the farm. But I think  our biggest I don't so we will be able to have a higher stocking density I'm sure I  don't know what that is yet. And so I can't give you a figure but where our profitability  
**[0:30:36-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:36):**  as a farm I am confident will improve is in our reduced level of inputs. So we're less  straw in the sheds. We're going to have to make less silage because we're feeding out.  So there's less tractor work in the winter. Less diesel not just the diesel that we're  
**[0:30:54-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:30:54):**  using on a daily basis but that you know the embedded energy and carbon that goes into  building tractors etc in the first place. And our costs on running those we will hopefully  be able to have fewer machines. So our running costs will go down. Our treatment costs will  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:07):**  go down and on animals and as I talk about the wormers and other things. And also then  of course the time it takes to do all of those things. So that's potentially less straw less  feed less diesel fewer machines as you go forward lower rates of medicine need and an  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:26):**  increased herd size. That's that's that sounds like it's a really positive story. Yes yeah  and the other the other final thing I guess on that yet which contributes to it is that  this is quite scary when you look at the number of animals that we will be running in one  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:38):**  group when we talk about running. The aim is to have one mob of cattle and one mob of  sheep practically at bulling times and different things that's not always possible. So it splits  down but it's certainly much fewer groups. And so the time taken to do the management  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:31:52):**  of the different groups as well will reduce. And so there can be more time spent with livestock  sort of out in the field and observing what's happening. And Humphrey who is our farm foreman  he's brilliant and he talks about feedback. He says you know the land tells you and the  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:09):**  animals tell you and that's what we haven't necessarily looked out for before with we've  been organic for a long time and we've ticked all the boxes and we've done all the stuff  but we've not maybe looked at what what our environment is telling us. And if you leave  
**[0:32:22-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:22):**  the animals for two for an extra day on a piece of land that you shouldn't have done  that the land will tell you or if you've moved them off too quickly you will see that and  it's all about feedback. So it gives us more time to focus on that which will allow us  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:33):**  to make quicker gains. And because you've been farming in and because you're farming  in the way that you are you're also contributing to and seeing a restoration of nature a regeneration  of nature around the farm and a is that correct and b are you also feeling that you're getting  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:32:51):**  additional carbon sequestration? Yeah well we're really early days but yes already Caroline's  my favourite phrase of hers is there's no such thing as waste so when we think about  long grass in fields and it's got away from us and maybe it's you know it's gone past  
**[0:33:06-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:06):**  its optimum energy level but actually even if that is the case with the traditional way  of thinking but actually with the animals trample that in it's just trampling in to  build more soil. And so when we when we start thinking like that and then and seeing the  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:23):**  spread of manure and the trampling effect that the animals are having now on on small  areas of the farm one by one and the rest times then yes are confident that we're going  to be much more carbon. And we did have one field as an experiment that we left ungrazed  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:39):**  we sort of grazed it for lambing time and then we left ungrazed all summer and loads  of species I say loads not quantify them but a number of species came up that we've not  seen on the farm before and so or certainly in recent years so we're really confident  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:33:55):**  that actually we've got a seed bank underground that will come if with more rest will come  to fruition and with more that will mean more species mean more soil biological activity  which means the ability to have more microbes and drag more material back down and a lot  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:10):**  more carbon in the soil. And more greater diversity of nutrition for the livestock as  well coming through there. And will you be able as you go forward do you think to integrate  new trees agroforestry within that system as well is that something you're planning?  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:27):**  Absolutely yeah and we're planning it because our initial planning of more agroforestry  came from wanting to provide more shade and shelter to the animals because as we are although  we're organic here we had some large fields that over the years I imagine were much smaller  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:42):**  but the hedges have come out you know for all the reasons we know but even here as one  of our high level stewardship schemes we had to take out a number of mature trees it seems  crazy now only 10 years ago we were taking down mature trees to not allow corvids to  
**[0:34:58-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:34:58):**  nest because we wanted to encourage ground nesting birds but in reality that fields on  a footpath and ground nesting birds were always going to be very unlikely. So all that yes  it's amazing what we learn in a relatively short space of time so actually we need to  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:12):**  put back trees for those reasons but yeah into breaking our fields up into smaller areas  and providing shade and shelter through our larger fields and we'll look at what species  of tree that we use that could be maybe you know looking at fruit trees and other things  
**[0:35:27-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:27):**  that will provide a second harvest as well as just providing the carbon locking up of  trees and also helping with soil structure and ground water that we because we have obviously  wet farming being on the flood plain.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:44):**  It's fascinating stuff and I think and hopefully we'll come back and talk about some of this  stuff again in the future but Caroline just on that sort of yield and economic impact  front I wonder if you could sort of comment generally about what you would expect from  
**[0:35:58-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:35:58):**  regenerative systems in the UK and elsewhere in the world.  Yeah absolutely I mean we mustn't forget that regenerative in the UK is pretty it's pretty  young still so there's many projects kind of in you know in the early stages and getting  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:11):**  great results and lots of people that are doing any sort of paddock grazing are seeing  an increase in yield almost immediately I'd say that's fair to say. I'm always a little  bit more cautious and some about you know you'll double your numbers and all the rest  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:24):**  of it I think in the UK we've always been quite highly stocked to start with. I think  the biggest opportunity is as we've just explained is getting rid of your input costs and then  being better for the planet for the fact that you can reduce your carbon output and all  
**[0:36:37-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:37):**  your costly output you know and your inputs you know sort of all the medications and everything  that Claire listed. That's a huge huge thing for farmers if you can be more profitable  and still produce the same amount of output then that's pretty good. And then I'm pretty  
**[0:36:51-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:36:51):**  confident from the evidence that we've seen of the kind of the projects that are in early  stages and from particularly from the people that are doing it really well across the world  in comparable places regions habitats and that we can definitely increase the productivity.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:06):**  I think in the uplands what we're finding with my wilde culture projects where you've  got large areas of moorland and heath and things like that slightly different what we  can achieve there is definitely regeneration of the soil and the ecosystem and the biodiversity  
**[0:37:20-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:20):**  and we certainly can maintain we hope productivity depending on the layout of the farm by you  know using the the heimatas and paddock grazing those in a way that's going to you know do  all the things that we've been talking about sequester carbon and increase output. But  
**[0:37:36-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:36):**  on the upland areas there's not a lot of scope for increasing numbers up there but overall  you just manage that you have to have a whole system redesign that's going to take out the  costs maintain numbers or yes slightly increase numbers.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-farming---making-the-transition-eami93#t=0:37:48):**  Well thank you very much both of you that's all we got time for in the autumn we'll try  and come back and have a second podcast on this subject to look at how these changes  are embedding you know how things are going for you what the challenges have been over

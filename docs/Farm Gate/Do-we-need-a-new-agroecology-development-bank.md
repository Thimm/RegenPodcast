### Farm Gate  (Tue, 30 Mar 2021 11:58:36)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:08):**  A new report, Farming Smarter, Investing in Our Future, has been published by the Food,  
**[0:00:13-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:13):**  Farming and Countryside Commission.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:15):**  The report proposes a new Agroecology Development Bank for Britain, which the authors say could  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:20):**  speed the transition to fair and nature-friendly farming by filling the current gap in available  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:25):**  finance and building knowledge about agroecological agriculture in the financial sector.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:31):**  I'm joined by report co-author Tony Greenham, Finance Research Associate for the Food, Farming  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:36):**  and Countryside Commission and Executive Director of Southwest Mutual.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:39):**  I'm also joined by George Young, an agroecological farmer from Fobbing Farm in Essex and a former  
**[0:00:45-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:45):**  banker in the City of London.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:47):**  George is at Farming George on Twitter and Instagram and Tony is at Tony Greenham on  
**[0:00:53-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:53):**  Twitter.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:54):**  Welcome both.  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:55):**  George, let me come to you first.  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:00:57):**  For producers transitioning to agroecological farm systems, is there a problem that needs  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:02):**  fixing in terms of access to finance?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:05):**  I think the main thing is the fact that it always takes time to build these new businesses  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:10):**  and a lot of these agroecological farming systems have not really been created yet.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:15):**  So there's obviously inherent risk in the unknown of what these systems are really going  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:19):**  to end up looking like.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:20):**  Now, I'm obviously coming from a farming situation where I've got historic farming background  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:25):**  in family farms.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:26):**  So kind of my access to finance might not be quite so limited as some other people.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:30):**  But I certainly think that the big issue with how the finance system works at the moment  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:34):**  with regards to farming is it's based around these old school siloed methodologies of farming  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:38):**  where people are doing single activities on their farm, which is kind of the antithesis  
**[0:01:42-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:42):**  of what we're trying to get at with agroecological farming methods.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:45):**  I think that there kind of needs to be something there to incentivise people taking these risks  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:50):**  in these new avenues and developing their businesses and getting to a point when their  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:01:54):**  new businesses become profitable, which won't be from the start of those businesses themselves.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:00):**  So Tony, in your assessment, what do you think the key barriers are that are faced by farmers  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:04):**  when it comes to setting up or transitioning existing farm businesses into agroecological  
**[0:02:09-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:09):**  models?  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:10):**  I think it's fair to point out that, as George has suggested already, actually, that there  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:14):**  are plenty of farming enterprises that can access finance, either because they can release  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:20):**  internal cash flows from starting to transition away from intensive methods by spending less  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:24):**  on inputs, basically, or because they do have a relationship with their bank and they have  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:29):**  plenty of security and a long track record where they're able to access affordable, appropriate  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:34):**  finance from existing providers.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:36):**  But, and we do think it's a significant enough but to propose a new banking institution,  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:42):**  we did identify several circumstances where access to credit is difficult.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:46):**  So the first one is a lack of security.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:49):**  So most banks find it much easier to lend against collateral.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:53):**  So obviously, if you're a tenant farmer, that makes it much more difficult than if you own  
**[0:02:56-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:56):**  your own land.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:02:57):**  And, you know, this significant amount of farming land is done under tenancy.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:02):**  Smaller farms, so there's simply a size equation, smaller farms tend to, again, find it more  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:06):**  difficult to access finance because it's just smaller deals, banks are a little bit less  
**[0:03:10-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:10):**  interested perhaps than they are in the bigger deals.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:13):**  And it just so happens that quite a lot of enterprises that want to move towards agroecology,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:17):**  you know, a lot of them are at that smaller scale.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:20):**  And that's a problem which varies according to which part of the country you're in, of  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:24):**  course, interestingly as well.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:25):**  But again, it's quite significant.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:26):**  Then we have new entrants.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:28):**  So this may even be, you know, the kids taking over the family business, so it's a succession,  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:33):**  or it could be brand new entrants where they simply don't have a management track record.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:37):**  And again, as a financier, as a banker, one of the things you rely on to make a lending  
**[0:03:41-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:41):**  decision is to be able to look at the track record with the people.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:44):**  And then the final piece, you know, which I think George has mentioned right at the  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:48):**  beginning, is when you might have people that you think have got a track record, then you  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:52):**  might even have security, and it might be a big sort of farm with a nice big loan that  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:56):**  you can make.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:03:57):**  But they're talking to you about using methods with which you as a banker are completely  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:01):**  unfamiliar, they feel untried, they feel untested.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:04):**  That's much more risky.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:05):**  You have to calculate that as being much more risky in your calculations as a banker.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:10):**  And it may well simply mean that that is just you don't have the appetite to make the loan.  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:14):**  And that's a terrible problem, because that's precisely the point at which we do need finance  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:19):**  to come in behind those that want to innovate, that want to bring agroecological methods  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:24):**  in.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:25):**  And yet, that's precisely the sort of risk taking entrepreneurialism that existing financial  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:30):**  providers are going to find difficult.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:32):**  So for me, if I wanted to take out a bank loan, then I'd need some kind of collateral  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:37):**  to put against that loan, it would be an extension on a mortgage to the house or the house would  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:41):**  be the collateral in some way.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:43):**  Obviously, with tenant farmers and with new entrants, that sort of thing isn't available.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:48):**  So in terms of the bank that you're talking about, is that very much based on the revenue  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:53):**  model?  
**[0:04:54-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:54):**  Well, in terms of the what the agroecological development bank would actually do in that  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:04:58):**  circumstance, we're not having to reinvent anything here or invent anything, I should  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:02):**  say because the British Business Bank already does a similar thing for smaller businesses  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:06):**  whose managers can't offer collateral and that's opposite guarantee.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:09):**  So it enables Barclays or HSBC and any of the big banks to make a loan because actually  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:14):**  they are able to go to the British Business Bank and in place of getting a security over  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:19):**  some property, they can get a guarantee from the British Business Bank.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:22):**  So we could simply, well what I'm proposing is an agroecological development bank could  
**[0:05:26-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:26):**  do a similar thing.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:27):**  But with the, instead of having the expertise in small businesses, its expertise is in agriculture  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:32):**  and agroecology and innovation in particular in more ecological methods of farming.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:37):**  George, over the last eight years or so, you've changed more or less everything about the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:42):**  way that your business is structured from what you grow to how you grow it to who you  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:47):**  sell products to and how you sell them.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:50):**  How have you financed your transition?  
**[0:05:52-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:52):**  I mean, to be honest, I finance it in a few different ways.  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:55):**  One and Tony mentioned this first of all, it's surprising when you really slash your  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:05:59):**  input costs, it's amazing how much flexibility you've actually got in your cash flow if you're  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:04):**  talking about a kind of reasonable scale established farming business.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:07):**  But as well as that, one of the big things I've done is because I've diversified my business,  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:12):**  I'm not kind of using my tractors as much.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:14):**  So they might be kind of on the older end of the scale, but they don't get so worn out.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:18):**  I'm actually able to mine those fixed costs over the short period of time because I don't  
**[0:06:23-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:23):**  need to be replacing them.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:25):**  There are various places you can mine your fixed costs, which is a really useful way  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:28):**  of short term sort of financing yourself.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:30):**  Actually then I have been utilizing BPS and stewardship, we're kind of at the end of this  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:35):**  halcyon period of having finance available to us in such a simplistic form.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:40):**  I don't particularly believe that Elms is going to come in and give the same level of  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:43):**  finance as the current stewardship scheme is, but I would love to be wrong about that.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:47):**  But those things I'm kind of utilizing that now to make sure I've changed my system for  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:52):**  the point when those subsidy schemes don't exist.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:55):**  And then actually another big one, because my main drive since I've come home to farm  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:06:59):**  has been cash flow rather than profitability.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:01):**  And I think when you're making these changes, cash flow is a much more important thing to  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:04):**  concentrate on.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:06):**  So I've really focused on diversification of my farm business.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:09):**  I'm fortunate in my location in South Essex, we're able to rent out commercial buildings.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:14):**  So you know, about five years ago now, four and a half, five years ago, I started developing  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:19):**  my farm buildings into commercial lettings.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:21):**  I haven't actually repaid that capsule yet.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:23):**  I'm probably about four years away from doing that.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:25):**  It's done a really significant job of fixing my cash flow year on year and giving me a  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:29):**  chance to kind of be a little bit more experimental with what I'm then doing on the farm.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:33):**  You mentioned basic payments there and stewardship payments, and being able to sort of use those  
**[0:07:38-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:38):**  while they exist in order to make some of those changes.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:41):**  Of course, there's a huge degree of uncertainty going forward over the next two or three years,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:45):**  which must make it not just difficult for farm businesses themselves to work out where  
**[0:07:49-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:49):**  they're going to be.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:50):**  But surely George, that's going to make it more difficult for banks to lend to farmers.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:55):**  It depends on the basis of those loans.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:07:57):**  It will depend on the region of the country, I'm sure.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:00):**  But I can't actually particularly see land values going down much because, you know,  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:05):**  in times of uncertainty, there are always certain things which are going to retain levels  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:10):**  of value.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:11):**  And I think in all likelihood, farmland is going to be one of those things that people  
**[0:08:14-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:14):**  feel comfortable investing in.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:16):**  I don't think it's going to absolutely crash.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:17):**  So I think that banks will be able to invest or not invest, but I think there will be loans  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:22):**  available if you own farmland to some extent.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:25):**  The question is, and this is back to exactly what Tony was talking about before, what is  
**[0:08:29-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:29):**  the appetite to risk of those lending places?  
**[0:08:31-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:31):**  Because so much has changed in terms of regulation.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:34):**  It's not just about loan to value anymore.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:36):**  There's a lot more complexity in it.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:38):**  There's a lot more complexity as to actually what your return is going to look like.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:41):**  A lot of these loans are looking at repayments where, of course, traditionally agricultural  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:45):**  loans have been interest only repayment or interest only, so no repayments associated  
**[0:08:49-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:49):**  with them.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:50):**  And so all of these regulatory changes which have hit the agricultural sector because of  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:08:54):**  loans in general are really shaping the difficulties of some of those lending around farm businesses.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:00):**  Tony, could I come back to you just for a moment on that issue of elms and uncertainty  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:05):**  going forward?  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:06):**  I wonder if you feel that if it was there tomorrow, an agroecology development bank  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:11):**  would be able to help with that issue of uncertainty.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:13):**  Well, I think it contributes towards helping.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:16):**  I mean, obviously, what you're also referring to here are how the availability of finance,  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:23):**  repairable finance or even equity interplays with other forms of revenue for the farmers.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:28):**  So what we've suggested is that the bank should certainly look into, we haven't suggested  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:33):**  any particular products, but it should certainly be able to look into ways of underwriting  
**[0:09:39-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:39):**  risk at the farm enterprise level.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:41):**  In other words, if you're a farming enterprise, as we say in the report, all entrepreneurs  
**[0:09:45-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:45):**  have to take risks.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:46):**  But with a farmer, you're betting the house, you're betting the family farm.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:51):**  When you're already possibly in a weakened financial situation because of the last few  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:54):**  years of difficulties in whichever markets you're in, it might vary.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:09:59):**  But certainly our analysis of the state of farm finances in the UK is that they are flattered  
**[0:10:04-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:04):**  by land values.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:05):**  But if you look underneath that, they're not good.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:08):**  So you're starting at a position of financial weakness.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:11):**  You then want to change your business models in a way where there's no certainty of success  
**[0:10:16-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:16):**  at all.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:17):**  It is the right thing to do.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:18):**  You're certain that in the end it will be more profitable and there may be strategies  
**[0:10:22-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:22):**  around releasing cash flow that are going to get you there.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:24):**  But nevertheless, it's more risky.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:26):**  Now we would like to say, well, what's good for society as a whole is that these individual  
**[0:10:31-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:31):**  farming enterprises do take those risks.  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:33):**  They do because each of them needs to explore what's going to work best on their farm.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:37):**  The problem is you have this economist sort of, we'll call it a fallacy of composition.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:42):**  Each of those individual decisions to maybe not take those risks makes sense for the individual,  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:46):**  but they don't make sense for society as a whole.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:49):**  And that's a classic case for why you need an intervention like a state development bank.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:53):**  George, you've taken over what's a pretty successful, if conventional, family owned  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:10:58):**  farm with a lot of land, as you were describing before.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:01):**  I wonder if you're able to articulate the challenge that some other farmers will face  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:06):**  and in terms of how does your financial situation differ from many new entrants and tenant farmers  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:11):**  in terms of the assets that they have available, the ways that they can get access to finance?  
**[0:11:16-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:16):**  Obviously, yes, I am in a very fortunate position that I'm on a family farm, but like I don't  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:22):**  know what percentage it will be, but a huge percentage of family farms, I've got a, you  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:26):**  know, obviously got a large mortgage against that as well.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:28):**  It's not as, you know, I hear many tenant farmers complaining about people who own their  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:32):**  farms, but I don't know many people who actually genuinely own their farms.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:36):**  It's normally a bank and much more complicated situation there.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:40):**  One of the things I'm very fortunate about is the fact that obviously we do have interest  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:44):**  only loans and, you know, we've managed to secure that and we've got very low interest  
**[0:11:47-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:47):**  rates.  
**[0:11:48-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:48):**  So we've got that ability to pivot in what we're doing.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:50):**  We've got that freedom there.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:52):**  One of the biggest problems I actually find with existing farm business or the biggest  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:56):**  things that I've struggled with is actually the cost of change management, because a lot  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:11:59):**  of the stuff that I've got is designed to farm large scale arable acres.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:04):**  Doesn't really do the small scale stuff I want to do, but the cost of me going smaller  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:09):**  when I've got maybe old machinery, but old machinery I've always looked after, or we've  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:12):**  always looked off from the farm.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:13):**  So I know what's good and what's bad about that.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:15):**  Whereas I couldn't chop that in and buy an appropriate smaller version of it.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:19):**  Typical example of this is my combine harvester.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:21):**  It's a massive class Lexian 650, seven and a half meter cutter bar thing worth about  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:26):**  80 grand.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:27):**  I couldn't buy a small one that I would know for sure is going to be any good.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:30):**  So I might as well keep the larger one.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:32):**  And there are quite a few examples of this, and it's one of those things that then when  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:35):**  you do go smaller, you've then got a higher labour requirement versus the fact those machines  
**[0:12:39-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:39):**  are already bought and paid for.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:40):**  So there are some slightly funky little nuances of how you actually start changing the way  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:46):**  that you farm to the mindset of that smaller, more nimble and more diversified farm when  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:52):**  you've got the kit and you've got the setup that you're designed for already.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:55):**  You've got a lot of those sunk costs already figured in essentially.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:12:58):**  As a former banker, I mean, you must clearly be a man who likes spreadsheets and who understands  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:03):**  business planning.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:04):**  How easy is it for other farmers to access financial training and to develop the business  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:10):**  planning skills that are needed these days?  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:12):**  I've always been interested in numbers.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:14):**  I did mathematics at university, so I might not have been very good at university mathematics,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:19):**  but arithmetic, not too bad.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:20):**  So spreadsheets have always come really easily to me.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:23):**  They've always been a really kind of handy tool to work out what my finances are doing.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:27):**  And I know that to a lot of people, spreadsheets are kind of a little bit double dutchy, but  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:32):**  I don't think they need to be.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:34):**  I mean, I've never I haven't got any formal agricultural training, so I don't know how  
**[0:13:38-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:38):**  people at Agricultural College are taught to do gross margins or things like that.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:41):**  But I do know that gross margins aren't worth the paper they're written on.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:44):**  And if you're working in gross margins, stop because you're not telling yourself anything  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:48):**  about your business.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:49):**  And I think for me, the best thing that I did was really drill down and understand exactly  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:54):**  what all of my costs meant.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:13:56):**  And also, whilst you're still stuck in a commoditized system whereby you are a price taker rather  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:01):**  than the price maker, you might do all this and feel quite depressed about how poor your  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:05):**  business is in a standard business scenario.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:08):**  But I've gone through and I assign various revenue expectation percentages to each asset  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:13):**  that I own.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:14):**  So really simplistic thing here is to say that the land that I own, well, I expect two  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:18):**  percent of market rate of that land every year.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:21):**  That's the equivalent land rent to me.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:23):**  I don't get that for free.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:24):**  That's what that needs to pay.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:25):**  And then, you know, any kind of variable input, so inputs I'm putting onto the land itself  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:29):**  with that has to pay 20 percent.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:31):**  So I go through and do those kind of things.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:33):**  But I think what would be massively beneficial is for the farming system to start working  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:37):**  like a lot of other business systems do already.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:41):**  Farming has always been considered almost like almost doesn't get considered like a  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:44):**  standard business because they tend to be family businesses and hereditary and people  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:49):**  don't necessarily learn proper business skills in them.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:51):**  And I think, you know, one of the big things when I used to work in banking was mentoring  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:55):**  people, always having mentors.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:56):**  And it was mentioned in the report and I was like, well, this is brilliant.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:14:59):**  This is exactly what's required.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:00):**  And again, in terms of like how a loan's judged or managed or understood from the agricultural  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:06):**  development bank, there have to be experts involved in that.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:09):**  And if there's a mentor who can actually start helping someone who's taking on these loans  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:14):**  to really understand their business in detail, understand what it really means for that business  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:18):**  to actually be genuinely making money on every single asset that they have and not happening  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:22):**  to forget some really crucial assets, which then means they're undervaluing the output  
**[0:15:26-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:26):**  that they're producing.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:27):**  I think it's absolutely critical to farming moving forward that we pull the socks up of  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:31):**  farming and get people to be really knowledgeable and savvy about the businesses that they're  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:35):**  actually running.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:36):**  Tony, in the report, you talk about there being two very clear and distinct roles for  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:41):**  the Agroecology Development Bank, one being, you know, to create products and to create  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:45):**  finance availability for farmers.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:47):**  But the other is to develop knowledge within the finance sector, but also to develop knowledge  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:53):**  of what a good business plan and what a decent loan application looks like, I guess, for  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:15:57):**  farmers who are interested in transitioning or building agroecological business decisions.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:03):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:04):**  In the course of our research, and indeed in previous research that I've done around  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:08):**  support for business finance, it comes up again and again, it's not enough to push out  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:14):**  financial products into a market.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:15):**  You have to make sure that the businesses in that market have all the access to the  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:20):**  skills, knowledge, advice that they need in order to be ready to take that money.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:24):**  And if you don't get both of those sides right, then you won't solve the problem.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:28):**  So we've suggested, therefore, that the Agroecology Development Bank, as well as providing the  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:33):**  finance, should do part of this role in terms of the knowledge around agroecology itself,  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:38):**  in terms of creating good, reliable metrics, which can be used both by banks and finance  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:45):**  companies and farmers themselves that can measure the underlying value creation of the  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:50):**  business.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:51):**  So that was a bit wordy, but really what I'm talking about is, is your soil getting healthier  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:55):**  or not?  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:56):**  What about the other characteristics on the farm?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:16:59):**  Are you sequestering carbon?  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:00):**  Are you producing healthier food?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:02):**  Are you improving biodiversity?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:03):**  A lot of these metrics now are becoming very relevant because of other conversations around  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:09):**  potentially trading them.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:10):**  We haven't tackled that in this report, but certainly from the basic view of making loans,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:14):**  but also in terms of farmers understanding how they're generating value in the business.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:18):**  I think that's completely appropriate for a bank as a national institution to work with  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:21):**  other knowledge institutions around bringing this all together.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:24):**  And one of the things that we really do think is worth trying to pursue is just making it  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:29):**  as easy.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:30):**  We want to put the, we call it to putting the entrepreneur at the middle of the picture.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:34):**  So that the farmer who is trying to do this is juggling a million and one things like  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:38):**  all small business owners have to.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:40):**  So the easier you can make it for them to access, not just the money, but also the knowledge.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:44):**  And if they need some formal training, where can they go to get that?  
**[0:17:47-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:47):**  They need some mentoring, who's going to provide that?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:49):**  They need to do a cash flow forecast and a spreadsheet.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:52):**  I've never used a spreadsheet before.  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:53):**  Who's going to teach me to do that?  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:55):**  And to be able to bring all these things together in a package with the finance is ultimately  
**[0:17:59-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:17:59):**  where we need to get to.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:00):**  In terms of making the case for what we're talking about here, the Agroecology Development  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:06):**  Bank is building on past experience in terms of stimulating and economically viable, but  
**[0:18:11-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:11):**  early stage sector.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:13):**  How does this proposal for a new bank compare with past innovations in energy, housing or  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:20):**  transport?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:21):**  Yes, well, we do draw comparisons with the Green Investment Bank's role in renewable  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:26):**  energy, because it's not unusual actually for there to be a new business model or a  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:31):**  new technology, which fundamentally on paper looks really sound.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:35):**  But then getting from it being good on paper to it being widespread practice in industry  
**[0:18:39-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:39):**  is a sort of implementation challenge.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:41):**  It's a sort of, you know, how do you spread that innovation and the knowledge to do it?  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:45):**  So to give a very practical example was that offshore wind was finding it difficult to  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:50):**  access finance from mainstream banks that would readily finance offshore oil exploration.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:18:55):**  It wasn't necessarily because they had anything against renewable energy, but they had all  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:00):**  of the experience and skills and data sets, you know, and long sort of track record of  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:05):**  performance to be able to simply assess offshore oil.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:09):**  And they didn't have that for wind.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:10):**  So they had the assets, they understood the asset, they understood the risk and they had  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:14):**  the model.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:15):**  Yes, that's right.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:16):**  And although they might understand in theory that offshore wind looks like a similarly  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:20):**  good bet, until that track record is established, and indeed the skills, the actual, but who  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:25):**  are the people inside the bank who know how to assess this?  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:29):**  And everybody has to learn and start somewhere, but who's going to pay for that learning effect?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:33):**  Well, again, a State Development Bank is a great place to help develop skills in the  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:38):**  broader banking market to develop a track record of historic data about performance  
**[0:19:42-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:42):**  of certain technologies or business models.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:45):**  And then what you'll find is that that knowledge gets diffused throughout the rest of the finance  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:49):**  system really.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:50):**  And that did happen.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:51):**  So offshore wind now isn't something that really needs any kind of intervention to help  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:55):**  finance it.  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:56):**  It's motoring, right?  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:19:57):**  Because it is a sound technology and now it's a proved profitable business.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:02):**  So I think we'll have the same with agroecology in that, you know, we certainly hope that  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:06):**  there'll come a point where this is absolutely the mainstream way of farming.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:11):**  But between here and there is a similar learning effect, a sort of implementation challenge,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:15):**  a sort of familiarity and a role for the State Bank, which can take these risks and pay for  
**[0:20:22-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:22):**  that sort of learning effect if you like.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:24):**  Just to interrogate that comparison with offshore wind just a little bit further, with offshore  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:30):**  wind, there are relatively few variables.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:33):**  Once a site has been scoped out, the main decisions are the size of the turbine and,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:38):**  you know, the way that it fixes to the seabed.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:40):**  And then they often get capitalised in ones or twos or small groups across a large wind  
**[0:20:45-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:45):**  farm.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:46):**  But it's a relatively straightforward thing to do in comparison with agroecology where,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:52):**  you know, the kind of solutions, the kind of farming solutions, the infrastructure solutions,  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:57):**  they're many and various.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:20:58):**  And so that's a lot of knowledge that's got to be built up within that bank.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:02):**  Do you think that's a reasonable expectation?  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:04):**  Well, I think you're right to point out that certainly the comparison doesn't hold true  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:10):**  for the nature of the technology, because you're right in pointing out that the number  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:14):**  of different, there is a certain standardisation to renewable energy.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:17):**  Whereas part of the point, I suppose, about agroecology is, you know, we talk about it,  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:22):**  you know, really being emphasising farming as a knowledge intensive industry, because  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:27):**  it is celebrating the skills and the knowledge and the specific contextual knowledge of the  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:33):**  farm itself, that particular region that you're in, bioregion that you're in and the soils  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:38):**  you've got.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:39):**  And so that's in that sense, it doesn't compare very well in terms of there being a sort of  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:43):**  cookie cutter approach, there can't be a cookie cutter approach.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:46):**  But on the other hand, there's still some sort of broad principles, which are pretty  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:49):**  clear for agroecology, and which are different from conventional agriculture, which lending  
**[0:21:54-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:54):**  institutions are used to.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:21:56):**  They're used to seeing people with a high input model, with all the kit that George  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:00):**  was talking about earlier, a small number of crops, and therefore a small number of  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:04):**  markets, you know, there's a certain spreadsheet, which will even cover all that into and it's  
**[0:22:08-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:08):**  going to give you an answer.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:09):**  And I mean, I suppose put it in its simplest, they need a new spreadsheet, which can manage  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:15):**  the complexity, but therefore, and of course, in the complexity lies the true economic and  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:20):**  business potential of agroecology, because it's this multiple yields approach.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:25):**  But that's just, it's going to require a bit of a different approach and different skill  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:29):**  set and different data and different ways of assessing the viability of a loan.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:34):**  And in your view, the principles and if you get the model right, and can manage that flexibility,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:40):**  the principles in themselves are strong enough to be able to develop enough institutional  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:44):**  knowledge.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:45):**  Just another thing that was brought up in the report was the question of ownership.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:49):**  And there are various different models that you look at.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:51):**  I wonder who you think in your perfect world, who should own the bank?  
**[0:22:55-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:55):**  Should it be wholly state owned?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:22:57):**  Or would all of the investment come from the state?  
**[0:23:00-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:00):**  Well, it should be wholly state owned.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:02):**  We recommend, I mean, we go through all the key design considerations for a state development  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:06):**  bank, drawing on the wealth of international and domestic here in the UK experience of  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:12):**  development banks to sort of go through the rationale for each of the decisions you can  
**[0:23:16-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:16):**  take.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:17):**  One of them is ownership.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:18):**  And we certainly think that if we're going to be serious about hitting on net zero carbon  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:22):**  targets, if we're going to be serious about meeting other policy objectives, public policy  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:27):**  objectives around health, around access to food, about rural livelihoods and regeneration  
**[0:23:34-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:34):**  around biodiversity and other environmental management, water and so on, then we've got  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:39):**  to recognise that agroecology is a really important part of that solution to multiple  
**[0:23:44-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:44):**  policy goals.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:45):**  So this is public policy stuff here.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:47):**  And it's entirely appropriate and indeed normal for development banks that are helping to  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:52):**  contribute to these public policy objectives to be state owned.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:55):**  It just makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:23:56):**  Apart from the fact that in terms of financing, so your second part of the question, there's  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:00):**  nobody that can borrow cheaper than the state.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:03):**  And in terms of how you finance it, a mixture of some capitalisation from Treasury, but  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:08):**  then actually, the bank could also go and borrow other private finance, it could augment  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:13):**  its funds with borrowing private finance, but at very favourable rates out in the market.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:17):**  So yes, we think it should be state owned and yes, partly financed directly out of public  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:22):**  budgets, but also able to borrow additional funds on markets.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:26):**  And that point I think that you made about its public policy role, because agriculture  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:32):**  and food production and land ownership and land use cut across so many important elements  
**[0:24:38-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:38):**  of public policy.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:40):**  If we can be in a situation in a couple of years time where this uncertainty around ELMS  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:44):**  has been tackled, where we have good funding levels maintained through ELMS, but then that's  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:50):**  coupled with more finance becoming available to those who want to farm in agroecological  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:24:55):**  ways, we'd actually be in a really good situation, which will be very different from I think  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:00):**  the situation many farmers fear.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:02):**  Certainly the plan is to make finance more available to more people, but would it also  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:06):**  be cheaper for farmers to borrow through the ADB?  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:08):**  Possibly.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:09):**  I mean, I should point out that the model that we suggest here is that the ADB actually  
**[0:25:16-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:16):**  lends through other financial providers.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:19):**  So this is the way that the British Business Bank works.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:21):**  You actually access finance from the British Business Bank through another bank or finance  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:25):**  provider.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:26):**  So if you like, it's a wholesale bank, we would expect that some of those products would,  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:30):**  it's not so much that they would necessarily be cheaper because there's an ADB product,  
**[0:25:35-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:35):**  it's more the fact that you can get it at all.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:36):**  So yes, it may well be, however, that there's an additional case for additional underwriting  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:42):**  to lower the cost.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:43):**  So we've seen this, of course, with the response to COVID-19 and the bounce back loans and  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:49):**  C-bills loans that again have been made available through the British Business Bank, distributed  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:54):**  by banks themselves, but at an interest rate of two and a half percent of the bounce back  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:25:58):**  loan, which is far cheaper than a business would have been able to access a loan before  
**[0:26:03-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:03):**  the crisis.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:04):**  So yes, I think we would leave it to the ADB to make specific judgments about the cost  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:09):**  of finance for certain things and in certain markets.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:12):**  But yeah, that's absolutely part of the toolkit, is talk about the cost of finance.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:16):**  But I think the biggest sort of problem to solve is actually the finances getting to  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:19):**  the right places quickly enough and in the right quantities.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:22):**  George, part of that toolkit is about having a really good understanding of what agroecology  
**[0:26:27-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:27):**  and an agroecological business plan looks like.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:30):**  And I wonder if you have any thoughts about how the bank would be able to ensure that  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:34):**  it was actually getting its financial product out to farmers that are genuinely undertaking  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:39):**  agroecological transition.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:40):**  For example, as with replant capital in the USA, should repayments be linked to delivery  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:46):**  of key metrics, for example, soil improvement, carbon quantities in soil?  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:51):**  It's a difficult one because I mean, Tony's mentioned the fact and you mentioned, Philo,  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:26:54):**  we're going to need more experts in the position of giving out these loans and in assessing  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:00):**  that these loans are in the right hands.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:03):**  And it won't just be a matter of someone showing a business plan and then being able to walk  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:08):**  away and essentially do what they like given the fact they've been given a lump of money.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:12):**  I think there are a couple of difficulties here though.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:15):**  The first one is that you might have an expert who's in a bank, but they're not the ones  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:19):**  working on the land.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:20):**  There are so many kind of niche versions of production all around the UK that will not  
**[0:27:24-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:24):**  work in other areas.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:26):**  And I think one of the really big, big things that something like an ADB would not want  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:29):**  to quash is some really innovative business models that might be completely out of the  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:35):**  ability of some parent expert to assess at that point.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:38):**  I get a little bit concerned when I hear about ecological and environmental outcomes just  
**[0:27:43-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:43):**  because I think they're so hard to assess.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:46):**  So it's how you kind of make sure that they're not necessarily tied to tests, which are not  
**[0:27:51-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:51):**  always going to be perfect.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:53):**  These outcomes will do better or worse given the kind of general place where someone's  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:57):**  farm is.  
**[0:27:58-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:27:58):**  If someone's farm is in the middle of a load of the really amazingly well-run countryside,  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:02):**  theirs will have much, much greater ecological benefits, much, much quicker than someone  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:07):**  whose farm is in the middle of an urban centre or close to urban centres.  
**[0:28:10-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:10):**  So those are the bits I've just got a little bit of worries about.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:13):**  I think it really comes down to a bit more of a hand-holding attitude to how these loans  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:18):**  are delivered and some trust between the bank and the farmers to genuinely provide those  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:24):**  figures and their cash flows as they go through to prove that they genuinely are doing good  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:28):**  things.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:29):**  That sounds like something that very much needs to be developed as part of that toolkit.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:34):**  There's a real sort of institutional knowledge, as you say, George, around not just saying  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:39):**  we're going to use these metrics because we always use these metrics and understanding  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:43):**  that one metric might be more appropriate for one farm or another, but you also might  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:47):**  be expecting quite different outcomes.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:50):**  So it's having knowledge within that institution about what is reasonable to expect and how  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:28:55):**  that farmer is able to demonstrate that in good faith they're doing their best in an  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:00):**  agroecological way.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:01):**  Yes, I agree with George that we need to be a little bit cautious of rushing into payments  
**[0:29:07-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:07):**  being linked to certain outcomes.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:10):**  Because I'm wary of the finance tail wagging the farm top, if you like, particularly because  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:16):**  finance quite likes to have a narrow number of metrics and part of what we're dealing  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:20):**  with here is multiple complex and interrelated outcomes.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:23):**  So certainly that's why, again, we suggest that this knowledge role for the ADB, at least  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:28):**  in the first instance, would be to start to try and bring a bit of draw together, a knowledge  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:33):**  base about what are reliable metrics, how to interpret them, how they might vary from  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:37):**  place to place, and start to try and build out the consistency and reliability of that.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:42):**  Also I think the second thing to say is that that sort of pinning of repayments or financial  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:46):**  returns to outcomes is a little bit more of an equity relationship than a debt.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:50):**  Now we are fundamentally have been talking about an institution here which offers you  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:54):**  a loan at a rate of interest.  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:29:56):**  We do say that we should look at the risk sharing equity piece as well, but I notice  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:01):**  that where these have been used in other places, and it is interesting, it tends to be an investor  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:05):**  coming in and sort of more as a partner, I think, with the farming enterprise, that has  
**[0:30:09-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:09):**  a sort of relationship, and that might be more appropriate because you're that much  
**[0:30:12-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:12):**  closer to it.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:13):**  I suppose the final thing to say is that one metric you certainly can measure is what's  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:16):**  your purchases of fertilisers and pesticides now, if you don't know what it was, because  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:20):**  there are certain key big wins that we want to drive out, and maybe a test of agroecology,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:27):**  progress towards agroecology is whether you're reducing those inputs.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:30):**  Tony, we've talked quite a lot about the purpose of the bank and the way that it might be constituted,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:37):**  the need that there is out there in the agriculture sector, but just thinking for a moment about  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:42):**  the political context, this is clearly an important year for action on climate change.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:48):**  The UK is hosting COP26 in Glasgow in November.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:52):**  Is there a political appetite, do you think, for this sort of a solution?  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:30:55):**  Well, we believe that there is political appetite for a solution like this.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:00):**  Certainly, we've had good initial conversations with policymakers and politicians.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:06):**  We see agroecology as being a nature-based solution, which the government is very interested  
**[0:31:11-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:11):**  in as a strategy for dealing with carbon reduction.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:15):**  However, we think it's more than that, because with agroecology, you don't just make progress  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:21):**  towards net zero, you have all these other beneficial yields as well.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:25):**  So we think it's worthy of close attention.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:28):**  And as you point out, the UK has got this prominent international role.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:33):**  It's for us to try and show leadership in this space.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:36):**  So any solutions which demonstrate how to accelerate the transition towards nature-friendly  
**[0:31:42-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:42):**  farming, I suppose we could call it, has got to be worthy of consideration.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:45):**  Furthermore, I think that whereas perhaps a few years ago, the case for this kind of  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:52):**  government intervention to get stuff done was harder to make, a combination of the fact  
**[0:31:57-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:31:57):**  that we do now have a British business bank, which has been very successful and recognised  
**[0:32:00-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:00):**  so by the government, and the current government is introducing a UK infrastructure bank as  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:04):**  well, which is one of the other big pieces that traditionally you have a state bank for.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:08):**  Actually, a lot of countries already do have a third type of institution, which is an agriculture  
**[0:32:13-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:13):**  bank, for all the reasons that we set out in this report.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:15):**  So the case for this, this is no longer a sort of an outlandish type of proposal.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:21):**  It's pretty mainstream, actually.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:23):**  So you put together, it's actually quite a mainstream sort of a proposal intervention,  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:26):**  quite trying and tested really, together with this grand mission that we have that the UK,  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:31):**  you know, the government has committed to, which is to, you know, have a clear, globally  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:36):**  leading route towards net zero.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:38):**  I think it should be squarely within the political appetite of this government and indeed any  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:42):**  other.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:43):**  It would be interesting to see, won't it, as we go forward through the year, whether  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:47):**  there is a big idea coming out of government in terms of COP26 and climate change mitigation  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:53):**  and adaptation.  
**[0:32:54-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:32:54):**  And it feels, it's always felt that land use and agroecology, you know, fits squarely within  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:01):**  that space.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:03):**  And you know, if we think of the ugly sisters of energy transport and housing, that's where  
**[0:33:07-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:07):**  the focus has always been in climate change.  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:10):**  And land agroecology, however it's dealt with, has always seemed to be a bit of the Cinderella,  
**[0:33:15-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:15):**  and it's only in the last year or two, certainly in this country, that politicians have started  
**[0:33:20-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:20):**  to understand that land can genuinely unlock so much opportunity for change, opportunity  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:27):**  for mitigation, opportunity for helping communities and societies adapt to be able to cope with  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:32):**  the flooding and the drought that's likely, and the fire that's likely to come, you know,  
**[0:33:37-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:37):**  with climate change.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:38):**  Do you get the sense from government, Tony, that they are looking for a big idea, that  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:43):**  they want a big idea to be able to launch, and that this, you know, this could be part  
**[0:33:47-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:47):**  of it?  
**[0:33:48-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:48):**  Well, I think the government is looking for any big ideas, and we'll need more than one.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:51):**  I mean, this is a giant challenge that we're tackling, and there'll be more than one solution  
**[0:33:56-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:56):**  to it.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:57):**  We certainly think this is one that should be in the set.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:33:59):**  You know, alongside that, in terms of what you've just said, actually, in question, we're  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:03):**  very conscious at the Food, Farming and Country and Scientific Commission of the interplay  
**[0:34:07-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:07):**  between this solution and the other things we're working on.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:10):**  So having a land use framework in the UK, and in fact, in all its constituent nations,  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:15):**  is equally critical, because one of the things that we might end up happening is you get  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:20):**  all these competing uses for land, you know, because somebody wants to sort of make the  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:24):**  land work as hard as possible to just do one thing, sequester carbon.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:28):**  But if we do that, then the trade-offs we're missing in all the other land uses, you know,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:32):**  we need to have that framework that can mediate this.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:35):**  And that's indeed a proposal of the FFCC that we should have such a thing.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:39):**  Even though before we have this, what I'd return to, which I think is so useful about  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:43):**  agroecology as an approach and a development bank to help accelerate the transition towards  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:47):**  it is because it is a land use that does an awful lot for you.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:51):**  It's not just one thing, you get your food crop, you get biodiversity, you get your carbon  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:55):**  sequestration, you get better employment, you get healthier food.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:34:58):**  That ability to do a lot of things in one go, I think does make it actually quite a  
**[0:35:02-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:02):**  big idea.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:03):**  George, just finally, as a farmer with personal experience, you know, obviously within the  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:07):**  financial sector as well as within agriculture, what do you think the key aspects, the most  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:12):**  exciting aspects of this proposal are for you?  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:15):**  One of the really cool things would be that we've obviously spoken a lot about the fact  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:19):**  that these solutions are complex.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:21):**  One of my biggest worries is the fact that whenever you talk to government, they want  
**[0:35:25-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:25):**  simplistic solutions.  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:27):**  So they love solutions like plant trees to sequester carbon, which everyone knows who  
**[0:35:32-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:32):**  actually does research on it is way, way too simplistic.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:35):**  And as Tony was just saying, like the whole point is that agroecology covers off so many  
**[0:35:39-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:39):**  of these things.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:40):**  So I think if the ADB could come in and kind of slip in there and show the fact that actually  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:45):**  the solution is complexity, not simplicity, that's going to be an amazing, amazing win  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:50):**  and kind of almost like a backdoor way to get some of these ideas through into government.  
**[0:35:55-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:55):**  But then personally, from a from a farming situation, my one love and the thing that  
**[0:35:59-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:35:59):**  I am pushing hardest for my farm is for ecology, for nature to thrive.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-a-new-Agroecology-Development-Bank-etsabt#t=0:36:05):**  And if this bank does well, and we can actually get access to finance that's driven down this

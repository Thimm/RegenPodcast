### Farm Gate  (Thu, 04 Aug 2022 11:05:54)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:09):**  of the Food and Global Security Network. This programme is the first in a series in which  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:14):**  I'll be talking to regenerative dairy producers from around the world as part of the Regen  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:19):**  Dairy Project set up by FAI Farms and Farmwell in collaboration with Unilever, Barry Callebaut,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:25):**  Walla Foods, Woolworths South Africa and Ben & Jerry's. Through the project, we aim to  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:29):**  define what regenerative dairy looks like from the bottom up and throughout dairy supply  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:35):**  chains and to engage dairy farmers and food businesses around a practical vision for a  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:40):**  productive and profitable global dairy sector that also restores its relationship with nature.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:46):**  Today, I'm talking to two fantastic farmers, both delivering regenerative dairy but in  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:51):**  very different environments and at very different scales. Blake Alexander is a fourth generation  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:00:56):**  dairy farmer from Alexander Family Farm near Crescent City, California, USA. And Bryce  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:01):**  Cunningham is a third generation farmer from Mossgill Farm in Ayrshire in Scotland. Welcome  
**[0:01:06-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:06):**  both.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:07):**  BLAKE ALEXANDER Thank you. Great to be here.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:08):**  MATT WILKES Thank you.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:09):**  I think because you're both from such different parts of the world, it'd be really useful  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:12):**  just to get a sense of the climate and the landscape in which you farm. Blake, am I right  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:17):**  that you have reasonably similar conditions to farming throughout the year?  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:20):**  BLAKE ALEXANDER Yes, absolutely. We live right on the edge  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:23):**  of a rainforest almost where the great redwood trees grow and right on the coast. And so  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:28):**  we're buffered in temperature by the ocean. So our average summer and winter temperatures  
**[0:01:33-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:33):**  are only 11 degrees apart, very cool and comfortable for cows.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:36):**  MATT WILKES And that's 11 degrees in centigrade or Fahrenheit?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:39):**  BLAKE ALEXANDER Fahrenheit, actually.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:40):**  MATT WILKES And are the conditions fairly flat or mountainous  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:43):**  where you are?  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:44):**  BLAKE ALEXANDER Yeah, we're only a mile or two from the  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:46):**  Windfall Mountains but they're covered with trees and we're right on these flat bottom  
**[0:01:51-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:51):**  lands that are adjacent to rivers and ocean.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:54):**  MATT WILKES So we've got a fairly flat landscape next  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:01:57):**  to the coast, in the lee of the hills. Not much change between summer and winter. Is  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:01):**  that the same for you, Bryce? Nice gentle winters and warm summers?  
**[0:02:04-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:04):**  BRYAN DUNN We've kind of got pretty sort of mild summers.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:07):**  Where we are in Scotland, the best weather's always rain. So you're always a day or two  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:11):**  away from rain. We're farming quite heavy clay type soils. It doesn't quite cold in  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:15):**  very wet, you occasionally get snow. The warmest it will be in the summer is actually this week  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:19):**  believe it or not, so this week we're hitting temperatures of about 28-29 degrees. In the  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:23):**  middle of winter we'll get about minus 10. We're generally able to graze the cows from about early  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:28):**  April until generally mid-October, the rest of the time they're housed and mainly because of  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:33):**  ground conditions and weather and the grass just stops growing. But basically to put it in short,  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:38):**  in the summer there's plenty of rain and sunshine to grow the grass, in the winter it's warm enough  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:43):**  not to have to run about in big, really hot, hot stuff. So that's the climate that you're both  
**[0:02:48-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:48):**  operating in, but the scale of your farm businesses is different as well isn't it? And Blake,  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:52):**  I wonder if you could briefly talk us through the Alexander family farm in terms of the size  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:02:57):**  farm locations and what you actually produce. We in total manage about 9,000 acres and so  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:05):**  quite large, spread over three counties which is the dairies are about two hours apart from  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:11):**  north to south on the coast. Our oldest son and his wife are on the south end of that with about  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:16):**  a third of our cows on a couple of farms there. We actually milk a total of 5,000 mature cows,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:22):**  just a little over 5,000 with maybe 42-4300 of those milking at any one time and the rest are  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:28):**  dry. And we do that in five different locations. And is it just dairy that you're producing or  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:34):**  you're producing beef or anything else as well? We actually years ago we had five children and  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:39):**  our two oldest boys started a chicken operation where we sell eggs. And so we have laying hens  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:45):**  that are out on grass grazing, mobile coops. We actually have about 35 to 40,000 hens at any one  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:52):**  time. And so we're selling eggs and then we also do some grass fed beef. We've at times raised all  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:03:58):**  of our bull calves up. Now we're raising a lot fewer. We're trying to make more A2 females.  
**[0:04:03-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:03):**  So 9,000 acres, 5,000 dairy cows that you're milking at any given time. So Bryce,  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:10):**  your farm is much smaller, but you started almost from scratch after a hugely challenging period  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:15):**  in 2015 and you've built up a really exciting dairy business in that time. Could you talk us  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:20):**  through what happened in 2015, just briefly, and the decisions you've taken since then and the  
**[0:04:26-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:26):**  scale of your operation today? So compared to Blake, it's not very substantial. So basically,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:33):**  in 2015 we had 150 milking cows. They were high producing air shea hosting cows and they were  
**[0:04:39-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:39):**  housed 365 days of the year on a four times per day milking rotation. Now what happened then was  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:46):**  my father and grandfather and my grandmother all died within two years of each other. So that was  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:51):**  three business partners who had died and obviously the business was thrown into turmoil. That also  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:04:56):**  happened at the same time as the international milk price crashed. So we went from being paid  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:00):**  27 pence per litre to 9.7 pence per litre. So what happened from there was the bank had pulled out,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:06):**  we weren't able to finance anything, so we effectively just had to sell up. So we sold up  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:12):**  about 100 cows, we sold all the farm machinery and we were tenant farmers, so we couldn't sell  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:17):**  the land. So we were left with not many cows and this big rent to pay and a bit of an opportunity.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:24):**  And that opportunity was that we could not have to work to the decisions and the ways of big dairy.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:29):**  And we were able to go back directly to the consumer and sort of have this idea of really  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:35):**  natural grass-based pasture-based farming and do something really different that hadn't really  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:41):**  been taken on in Scotland at the time. So we went back to 28 milking cattle, we pasteurised the milk  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:46):**  which is a legal requirement in Scotland and we started selling to our local community. Luckily  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:52):**  for us, the local community were very passionate about it. They remembered the old fashioned milk  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:05:57):**  from the sort of 60s and 70s at the time, but we also fell upon the fact that because of the way  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:02):**  we brewed the milk and the low and slow method of pasteurisation, it worked very well in speciality  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:08):**  coffee shops. And we started moving into Glasgow, which is our closest city, about 25 miles away.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:13):**  And once we sort of found out that that worked very well and the speciality coffee shops found  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:18):**  it worked very well, we started growing the business. So if we go on seven years today,  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:23):**  we're working with four other organic farms in the South West of Scotland and we're delivering  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:27):**  barista milk to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness, as well as doorsteps right across the  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:33):**  central belt of Scotland as well. And we're sort of, our whole sort of purpose going forward today  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:38):**  as a sustainable future for Scottish dairy. What happened to us, I believe was very unfair. We had  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:44):**  no say in how our milk was sold. We were basically selling a white commodity to a big business that  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:49):**  was selling it for a market price that they had no interest in enlarging. So that's what we believe  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:54):**  today, that we can take this as both farmers and milk processors and push this story and really  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:06:59):**  show that things can be done differently. So effectively you're a hub for those four  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:04):**  organic dairy farms and you do the distribution with that. And you've also got your own brand,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:08):**  which is the kind of the fully regenerative brand that you sell. And I don't think you've mentioned  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:13):**  the connection to the poet Robbie Burns, who many people will be familiar with, with the New Year's  
**[0:07:18-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:18):**  poem, Old Lang Syne. Of course, so Robbie Burns, more than having just been Scottish is the reason  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:25):**  we use him as our ambassador. So Robbie himself, he lived in this very farm where I'm sat today,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:30):**  Mossgill. And he came here during a time of family turmoil. His father had just died. He had died a  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:37):**  bankrupt. They were not able to then borrow money because the family had been associated with a  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:42):**  bankrupt. They'd changed the family name from Burness to Burns. And Miss Gill was going to be  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:47):**  their chance at life to be able to turn the new leaf and move on. So Robbie was here when his  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:51):**  first book of poems was published. And one of his greatest love poems, Tearmose, was written here.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:07:56):**  And Tearmose was written all about the change that humankind was bringing to nature, about how we  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:03):**  were fighting nature and changing it in such a way that we were causing destruction. When we were  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:07):**  going through the turmoil and the more and more I was reading about Burns's story and his legacy at  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:11):**  Mossgill, I felt we really struck a chord with it. We were sitting there going, we're milking cows  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:17):**  four times a day, house 365 days of the year. But actually 100 years ago, that would have been  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:23):**  something that had been possible to do. So we started going down the route of cow with  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:28):**  calves day-raving. So we only have 40 cows now at Mossgill. But leaving the calves with them,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:33):**  we're farming regeneratively and we don't feed any cereals either.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:36):**  Fantastic. And just finally, Bryce, I just want to check how many acres you have.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:39):**  We farm 200 acres here at Mossgill.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:41):**  I want to come back to scale later in the program. And we're going to talk about some of those other  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:45):**  issues in the cow with calf element as well. But before we get there, let's talk about regenerative  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:50):**  dairy itself as a distinct way of farming. And Blake, your website claims that Alexander  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:08:55):**  Family Farm is America's first certified regenerative dairy. What does that mean?  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:01):**  What is regenerative farming to you?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:03):**  I think before I answer that, I'd like to make, maybe make a connection back. I grew up on a farm  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:09):**  milking 150 cows on a rented facility. For me, in my mind, that was just a few, you know, a few  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:15):**  minutes ago, but it was 40, 50 years ago. We've just been really aggressive in that regard to get  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:20):**  to what the size and scale we're at now. Regenerative kind of came along. I think  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:25):**  regenerative for me is a word that came along to describe something we were already doing.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:30):**  When we first bought our first facility, my wife and I moved to the northern area where we're at  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:36):**  now. It was 500 acres or so at the time. And within a few years, we were milking three times  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:42):**  a day back then, kind of a more high yield production agriculture approach. And, you know,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:47):**  harvesting feed across the road and hauling it over, storing it and feeding it, you know,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:52):**  a few months later, and that feed was all permanent grass or haylage. A few years into that,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:09:58):**  we had a big devastating fire and changed our outlook a lot. And so that's when we really got  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:04):**  into organic. There was a group out here in the west looking for organic milk. And so we decided  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:10):**  to pursue that. And so first it was organic. So this is maybe 22 years ago or so. What I learned  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:17):**  about was organic matter and just monitoring organic matter in the soil and paying attention  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:21):**  to that. And so that was our focus. And when you focus on organic matter, and maybe you do a little  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:26):**  composting and you start doing soil amendments and paying attention to biology, wow, all of a  
**[0:10:32-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:32):**  sudden you are a farmer in a sense and your focus is correct. And so we've seen our original organic  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:39):**  matters on the ranch go from two and 3% all the way up to 15%. So we're probably averaging 10  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:45):**  easily on the land that we've managed for quite a while. And that's just phenomenal. I'm really  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:51):**  proud of that. And we've been able to source a lot of inputs to come into the farm to add to our  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:10:56):**  compost pile on local waste resources, fish and wood chips and different things like that.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:02):**  Being the first regenerative farm kind of came in that we were launching some milk nationwide in  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:08):**  tartans. It was ESL extended shelf life milk. And so that was going to be going across the country.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:13):**  And we're working with a big company, Whole Foods. We're explaining to them that we're regenerative.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:18):**  And we had been working with two different regenerative groups for about three years as  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:22):**  one of their pilot farms around the world. And Whole Foods had asked, well, do you have a  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:26):**  certificate that we can hang on the wall or talk about? And it's like the answer is no, we don't.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:31):**  So that was in October about two years ago. And so I went back to both programs and said,  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:36):**  you know, we're launching here in January, February of 21. We'd sure like to have something  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:40):**  to talk about. And so both groups got a certificate for us. And it was the first ones that they had  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:45):**  done. They'd been talking about it, talking about it, working with farmers all around the world.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:50):**  And so just because we asked, because we were launching nationally, boom, we get a  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:55):**  certificate that made the news. And so that's how that happened.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:11:59):**  And who's that certified by?  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:01):**  So the first one would be Regenerative Organic Alliance. And that's called the  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:06):**  ROC certification, which is the Regenerative Organic Certificate. The second one is the  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:11):**  Savory Institute's group, EOV, which is Ecological Outcome Verify, where they're  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:17):**  actually verifying the numbers and the stats of the soil and monitoring every year.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:23):**  Brilliant. Thanks so much. Now, Bryce, I wonder what regenerative dairy means for you. You run  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:28):**  a cow with calf system, as you mentioned, so animal welfare is clearly part of your regenerative  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:33):**  farming approach. Could you talk to us a bit about that and how fundamental that is to your  
**[0:12:37-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:37):**  own definition of regenerative farming?  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:39):**  Yes, of course, the cow with calf aspect of the system they operate,  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:43):**  that's sort of leaving the dairy calves with the cows for four months. And then instead of  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:48):**  separating them at that point, we actually use special quiet weaned tags to allow the calves  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:53):**  to stay with the mothers. And that's all the way through to housing. At that point, we sell the  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:12:57):**  dairy bull calves away for deal production. We work with a butcher for that, which ends up in  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:02):**  Edinburgh in London. And dairy heifers stay in as replacements and to ultimately grow the herd  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:07):**  over time. The time with regenerative, I spent about three years trying to work out  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:13):**  in my head what regenerative meant to most people. I sat down doing the savoury course,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:17):**  the people in the UK that do savoury is the BLM. And through the course started the ecological  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:23):**  outcome verification, I actually stopped at one point because my neighbour made a different route.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:27):**  But the sort of the definition I ended up getting was when we started using multi species herbal  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:33):**  lays in the farm, we stopped ploughing, we started using herbal lays and the sort of idea that I had  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:37):**  was could we sustain food production on farm with zero inputs? The reason being when we were  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:43):**  conventional, we were bringing genetically modified soy, I was thinking about the carbon emissions  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:48):**  that are happening on farm, the inputs we're buying, I thought, right, we've got 200 acres,  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:52):**  we don't have many cows, could we grow 100% of the food that we feed those cows to produce a  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:13:57):**  human edible food and then regenerate the land so it actually better the land over time, as opposed  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:02):**  to having to mine somewhere else to bring into the farm to improve it. So we've now been doing that  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:07):**  for three years now. The change we're seeing in the farm is radical and we're seeing that the herbal  
**[0:14:11-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:11):**  lays are working, we're growing a phenomenal amount of dry matter in those herbal lays and we  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:17):**  are sustaining milk production at this level. In fact, this year in particular, we could probably  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:21):**  double the herd and we're looking to triple the herd in the next 10 years on the same amount of  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:25):**  land. So that's what we believe regenerative is, not just sustainable, but regenerative.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:29):**  When we look wider into the platform that we have for other farms to sell into, we're also looking  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:35):**  at how we power that plant. So that's where we're looking at becoming net zero through using  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:40):**  renewable technology, battery electric vehicles powered by the solar panels that we have,  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:45):**  putting up wind turbines, we have biomass and biogas technology coming as well. We're just  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:50):**  looking to basically have a hub that is completely self-sufficient and not reliant on outside sources.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:14:56):**  So just coming back to the Cowlewood Calf, it's not that Cowlewood Calf is necessarily  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:01):**  something that has to be part of Regen in your own way of thinking, but it's something that you think  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:06):**  works really well on your land. Yes, it does work very well on this land. The very initial reason  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:11):**  that we became Cowlewood Calf was, as I mentioned earlier, a week and a half, five to seven months  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:16):**  long winter. When we were bucket feeding calves, even with our mother's milk, when we became  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:20):**  pasture for life, certified, not buying grain, we've seen a massive drop off in the daily  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:25):**  calf weight gain. We just couldn't grow the calves and they were getting to two years old,  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:29):**  they were tiny calves and we weren't calving right. And then we thought, you know, this isn't  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:32):**  how nature works. Nature doesn't take a calf away and bucket feed it, nature suckles a cow.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:37):**  So we tried doing that and then we found out the next problem was the calves were growing like  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:42):**  mad to four months and then during separation, that's when they were taking that check and  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:46):**  losing the daily weight gain. So that was when we put the tags on them and keep them with their  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:51):**  mothers until sort of seven, eight months back. And then, you know, we're now getting these really  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:55):**  strong heifer calves over time and it's working really well for the system.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:15:59):**  But look, Bryce, those calves are taking a third anyway, of the milk that you're producing.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:05):**  Can you still make a profit?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:06):**  Yes, we can. So because we have such little input costs, you know, we're basically not  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:12):**  buying anything. The biggest cost we have on the farm itself is the farming contractors coming in  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:16):**  to do the grass silage for us and the field work. And one day that bill will go as well once we get  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:21):**  a better handling of things and a bit more capital behind us. But yes, the reason that we can make it  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:26):**  turn over a profit is because we have zero transport miles between the cows and the processing  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:31):**  plant. We have got some very dedicated supporters who buy the milk. So yes, we're selling the milk  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:35):**  for about 30% more than the other milk that we sell organically. But at the end of the day,  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:39):**  the people that want to buy this product are buying the product. And because we've got low  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:43):**  cost of production, we don't have this complete issue. We have to dilute costs everywhere through  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:48):**  milk production.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:49):**  Fantastic. Now, Blake, you produce liquid or fluid milk for national sale, but you also have your own  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:54):**  branded products. And on one of your farms in particular, your cattle are 100% pasture fed.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:16:59):**  Why is it that that's just on one farm and why that farm in particular?  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:03):**  It happens to be our smallest farm where we have the most control. We started there with that 100%  
**[0:17:09-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:09):**  grass fed model about 11 years ago when the large national co-op here in the United States called  
**[0:17:16-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:16):**  Organic Valley was looking to launch a grass fed milk product, a fluid product. And so we were,  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:23):**  back then, we started with 500 cows out of the 700 that they started with on three farms in  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:29):**  our region. And so we helped them launch that. We committed to that program for three years. And  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:35):**  at the end of three years, we chose to take our milk in a different direction for a lot more  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:39):**  money basically. The cost of that production was so much higher. There was an incredible learning  
**[0:17:45-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:45):**  curve. Cows were really starving for nutrition and carbohydrates primarily. And so our solids  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:52):**  and components had went way down on the production, not to mention that the production had gone way  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:17:56):**  down. And here we are about a dozen years later, we've switched breeds of cattle using the Fleck  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:02):**  V breed from Germany primarily that we just absolutely love. And so they're dual purpose.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:07):**  We've got a better life cycle, I'd say, for the male calves as well as the mama cows.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:13):**  And we're really happy with that farm now and the yields and production. We now market some of that  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:19):**  milk ourselves as another yogurt company that has been using that milk nationally for about six,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:25):**  seven years. And we have set the wheels in motion to convert another one of our dairies. And so  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:32):**  we'll have two dairies by this time next year on 100% grass fed. So we are moving more in that  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:37):**  direction now that we've got the genetics correct. Fantastic. It's really interesting always when  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:42):**  I'm talking to regenerative dairy farmers or regenerative farmers in general, there has been  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:47):**  this need to experiment to kind of work through challenges and problems and come out the other  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:53):**  side. And of course, you know, we're now in the situation where we have people like yourselves  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:18:57):**  who've gone through these experiences. And so there's a degree to which your experience  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:03):**  de-risks the challenge for other farmers going into regenerative production in the future,  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:08):**  which is just fantastic. I'm just wondering, Blake, how your farms that aren't 100% pasture  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:13):**  fed compare with the ones that are, and I mean, presumably you're using quite a lot less  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:18):**  concentrate than the mainstream dairy producers would in the rest of the USA.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:22):**  Blake  
**[0:19:28-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:28):**  Yeah. We've learned a lot, particularly this winter, we've invested a lot in our brand.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:28):**  So we've kind of bet the farm on our brand working and we've been marketing our own milk for a  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:34):**  little less than five years. We had a long dry winter in a sense, there's been a drought up here  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:39):**  in the western United States for multiple years. And so forages are hard to come by, cash flow is  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:44):**  hard to come by. And so we've really fed a lot less purchased feeds to our cattle this winter.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:52):**  And so I'll just tell you this last month, the month of June, our 100% grass fed cows out milked  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:19:58):**  the other four hertz. And so we're really excited about that. Not only that, but as we started  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:03):**  testing throughout the winter, we test milk urea nitrogen in the herds randomly. And we clearly saw  
**[0:20:09-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:09):**  that the 100% grass fed cattle were healthier. And so they could handle the down cycle here  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:17):**  financially on the farm better than the rest. And so that was very, very encouraging compared to say  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:23):**  10 years ago with the wrong cattle out there. And they're just kind of thin and not performing and  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:28):**  not breeding back. And you know, it just wasn't a healthy situation. When we launched our brand,  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:33):**  say six years ago, thinking that through, we decided, well, we're going to do it with grain,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:38):**  because we didn't want to not have those tools in the toolbox to take better care of our cattle.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:44):**  So we've learned now that, you know, maybe we could rethink that and have a little of both. And  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:49):**  so we do not feed very much grain to the cattle that we do feed grain to. One of the things that  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:55):**  concerned a lot of farmers that we've spoken to through the Regenerative Dairy Project is Green  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:20:59):**  Wash. The idea that farmers and in particular big companies could jump on the Regen bandwagon  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:05):**  and misuse the word regenerative. Your claim is right out there. It's very bold. You're  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:10):**  fully certified. How do you demonstrate your regenerative credentials to customers, Blake?  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:16):**  I always make the statement that I've been saying this to my kids and to our employees for years.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:20):**  We got to do the right thing at every turn. And then, you know, ultimately God is watching us  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:24):**  kind of how we look at it. We didn't invent regenerative. We didn't. We're just looking at  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:28):**  a system that was created by somebody more powerful than us. And we're paying attention  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:33):**  to it. We're understanding the biology and the soil and the relationship between everything.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:38):**  And we're cycling carbon back into the soil and we're doing our share to somewhat heal the planet,  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:44):**  if you will. So your regenerative claim is robust and it's certified and you can be loud and proud  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:49):**  when you talk about it, whether that's on a carton or on your website or just talking to customers,  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:55):**  you know, when they come onto the farm. But are you concerned that regenerative agriculture as a  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:21:59):**  farmer led movement could be undermined by an expansion of corporate interest in this area?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:04):**  Sure. I absolutely understand the question and I get bothered by that, right? I've watched the  
**[0:22:09-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:09):**  organic industry now for 25 years and I've seen the dilution of the integrity of a lot of programs.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:16):**  100% grass fed is one that, you know, the term grass fed is thrown around all the time  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:21):**  and regenerative is going to be quite similar. And so now I know that retailers are willing to,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:28):**  you know, put regenerative on a package, whether it's on the front panel or the back panel.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:32):**  And it doesn't say certified regenerative, it just says regenerative. And you know,  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:35):**  what does that mean? Well, like everything else, eventually it doesn't really mean anything.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:39):**  I fight that or work on that or lean in that direction all the time to try to correct that.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:45):**  And that's why we go out of our way to kind of be an example of somewhat large scale that can  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:52):**  have the ability to attempt to do things right and to prove that it can be done at scale.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:22:57):**  You know, that's kind of our personal mission. That's what drives me.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:00):**  I just want to do the right thing at every turn one more time.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:04):**  On your website, Bryce, you say that you farm regeneratively and organically. So thinking back  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:09):**  to your definition of regen dairy, how do you measure and demonstrate that regeneration to  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:14):**  your customers? First of all, can I just say that everything Blake has said, I would probably just  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:19):**  say myself, on a much smaller scale. The difference for us is, I suppose, we are probably  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:24):**  20 years behind you, Blake. It's our passion to grow, to get the message out there that dairy can  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:28):**  be done differently. It can be done in a sort of unique way that can work with nature and, you know,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:32):**  just really basically go against the rhetoric that the big dairies have had there for the past 30 or  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:37):**  40 years, but also show that there's power in having farmers around the place. It's our vision  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:42):**  to have small farmers up and down the place and we offer a platform for them to sell to the market.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:47):**  The thing for us recently has been, you know, we've got a very close connection with our customers.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:51):**  The furthest our milk goes is about 100 miles. So for us, it's always been, we've never hit the  
**[0:23:56-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:23:56):**  market and budget. We've had a social media page, however, so I would go out and stand in a field  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:00):**  and I would talk about, you know, this is what I believe regenerative agriculture is. Here's where  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:04):**  Hebel lays, here's where cows and calves. We invite people down to the farm, any new customers  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:10):**  we take on, we invite them down, you know, let's go and walk in the fields, you know, let's go and  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:14):**  see the good, the bad and the ugly. Just totally honest marketing as well, you know, just telling  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:18):**  the truth, as you say. If everything's going wrong and it's raining and, you know, we can't get cows  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:22):**  out to the grass, we have to tell our customers that. If the milk tastes changes, we have to tell  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:26):**  our customers that. We just have to be open and honest and say, you know, this is what we get  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:29):**  right, this is what we get wrong and this is what we believe in. And I believe that that's where  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:34):**  we've got the uniqueness in the industry and what's going on.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:36):**  And of course you're organic certified, so there'll be sort of key metrics in there that you'll be  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:41):**  able to demonstrate in terms of regeneration. And you were talking about the EOV, the Alan Savory  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:46):**  process that you were training in as well. So you clearly have an understanding of the sorts of  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:51):**  things that you're trying to regenerate. Are you measuring any of those specifically or are you  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:56):**  just sort of seeing it take place before your eyes?  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:24:59):**  We're sort of seeing it as we take place. As I mentioned earlier, we've had such a tight budget  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:03):**  for the past six years. We were effectively bankrupted. There was no fund that was willing  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:07):**  to work with us. So it's been a case of go out there with a smartphone and a clipboard  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:11):**  with a bit of paper. We would take a picture, we would write down what we see, do the same again  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:15):**  six months or a year later. And yes, it's very basic measurements and we're not getting into  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:19):**  nitty-gritty of these things. We're seeing worm counts have quadrupled in the farm in three years.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:25):**  We're taking pictures of areas that were really heavily poached with the cows because of the wet  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:29):**  weather. But we've changed that whole way of grazing onto the holistic management,  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:34):**  plant grazing sort of idea, which has totally changed the farm. Yes, we're seeing negatives  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:39):**  as well. So we've got a lot of rush problem in the farm, which goes right back to Bunz's time,  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:43):**  which we need to manage better. But you know, every year I feel we're getting better yields  
**[0:25:47-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:47):**  out the grass, better yields out the cows, and the whole farm is looking healthier. So the next  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:51):**  stage for us is to start measuring on Mowinsley. And you talk about things like the worm count  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:55):**  there. So there are things that you are measuring and you're taking those photographs. And in  
**[0:25:59-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:25:59):**  fact, actually that's quite a powerful narrative when you get into a conversation with customers  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:03):**  to be able to sort of explain that regeneration that's physically happening. Do you think there's  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:07):**  a danger that larger companies will try and water down what it means to be regenerative? And if that  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:13):**  is a danger, how do you think we can guard against it? I do see it as a danger. However, as Blake  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:18):**  touched on, every single buzzword, every single new thing is always a new thing that's going to  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:23):**  get watered down. So let's take artisan, for example. 15 years ago in the UK, artisan bread  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:28):**  was artisan bread. It was made by one person making a similar dough bread, or one person  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:33):**  making a beer in a particular way. Nowadays you can go to an airport and a massive airport chain  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:37):**  can sell you a toasty that's made of artisan bread. And you don't find well it has nothing  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:42):**  to do with artisan. And it all goes back to this book. Now it's fascinating because I finished  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:45):**  reading this book today, believe it or not. It's called The Purple Cow. And it's nothing to do  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:49):**  with cows and agriculture. It's all about marketing. And what the writer talks about is  
**[0:26:54-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:54):**  how you have to find your purple cows. If you're driving past a herd of cows, those herd of cows  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:26:58):**  become boring after you see 10 or 12 of them. But if you saw a purple one, that would be outstanding.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:02):**  Now everyone's looking for the purple cow in their industry. So regenerative agriculture seems  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:07):**  to be the purple cow right now. And everyone's going to latch onto that and they're going to  
**[0:27:11-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:11):**  water it down. So what we have to do, if we believe that regenerative is this thing that is  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:15):**  important, that is a way of life that we have to go forward with, we have to make sure that that's  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:19):**  our purple cow and hold onto that and make sure it's understood right from the family that's up  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:24):**  a high rise block in the middle of Glasgow to someone that's living in between five different  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:27):**  dairy farms in the middle of the countryside. We have to make sure we get that message across using marketing.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:31):**  I had no idea that you were breeding purple cows up in Scotland. I must come and see those at  
**[0:27:36-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:36):**  some point. Blake, one of the challenges it seems to me is how best to scale regenerative dairy.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:43):**  Now you've got one of the largest regenerative dairy farms that we've found in the world, with  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:47):**  your business being delivered across a number of sites, well five sites, over a large geographical  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:53):**  area. How have you managed to achieve that scale while maintaining the regenerative ethic and  
**[0:27:58-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:27:58):**  keeping control over standards? It's a great question. It perplexes me sometimes. Again, I think it's that  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:06):**  motto of trying to do things right at every turn and we literally are teaching our employees and  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:12):**  our managers, which is now three of our oldest children, to just keep going in this direction  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:18):**  and make it work. I'm a bit of a dictator in that sense that we don't let things happen.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:24):**  I don't allow an employee to say, I couldn't pull that cow out of the group. She didn't want to come.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:28):**  I was like, no, no, we have dominion over the cows. We make the rules, go get her. And so I've had that  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:33):**  attitude for 40 years. I don't know where it came from. It's what I've got. I love the way  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:39):**  Bryce was talking about raising eggs calves. And we certainly looked at that because, wow, that's  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:43):**  the right way. We've done that when I was younger. Calves ended up a little wild because we weren't  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:49):**  doing, we were putting them on nurse cows, kind of in the outback, if you will. And then we tried a  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:28:54):**  little different. And then, you know, it's just too complex in our winters that are extremely wet.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:00):**  It just scares the heck out of me and how we would do that with so many animals. So we're  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:05):**  raising our calves. We're feeding them milk three times a day. We feed a lot of our milk to the calves.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:09):**  And I mean a lot. Three times a day, probably a couple of gallons, you know, in terms of liters,  
**[0:29:15-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:15):**  they're probably getting three, almost three liters each feeding. You know, we feed eggs,  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:19):**  a lot of eggs to our calves for protein and other immune reasons. And we also feed kefir. So we're  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:26):**  culturing kefir with kefir grains in an old fashioned style, feeding that to baby chicks,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:32):**  as well as our calves on a daily basis. And so we are absolutely going out of our way to do what we  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:38):**  do. It's extremely expensive. So now I'm happy to do things like this because we need to tell the  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:45):**  consumer, the retailers and the world that, you know, they've got to be willing to pay for extra.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:50):**  How many staff do you have?  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:52):**  All together right now, probably 160. I mentioned we're in three counties. We grow hay in eastern  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:29:59):**  California, the other upper corner of California, where we've got about 2000 acres of irrigated  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:04):**  alfalfa. And so right now in the summertime, we've probably got about 10 to 12 people over  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:09):**  there full time. We also process our milk in the San Francisco Bay area in California. So that's  
**[0:30:17-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:17):**  down the road quite a ways, about almost 380 miles from the farm. And we have 25 employees there as  
**[0:30:24-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:24):**  well.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:24):**  And each of your farms, am I right that each of your farms is run by a different member of your  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:29):**  family? That it's a family run business at each farm level?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:33):**  Yeah, totally. And I our family includes Santos and Adan and Pancho and Chabon and all these  
**[0:30:41-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:41):**  people that have been with us as employees for a long time. And so yeah, we own and operate all  
**[0:30:48-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:48):**  five farms. At this point, we also have a logo where we're now launching some, well, we have some  
**[0:30:55-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:30:55):**  regenerative cheese aging, but we've been working on a powder project to bring a two powders to the  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:01):**  world. And so we had to partner with other farmers to do that. So we have a logo called Eco Berry,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:07):**  that is now on some infant formula cans. That means that we've basically endorsed other farms  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:14):**  to make milk at our standard, if you will. And it's not regenerative yet. It's not A2 always,  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:21):**  sometimes it is, but sometimes it isn't. There's a crisis, infant formula crisis here in the United  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:27):**  States right now. And so we are actually just becoming a really, I guess, significant producer  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:32):**  of whole milk powders for one of those companies. And we're really excited about that.  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:38):**  You talk about the way in which, you know, you're still very much the boss. Do you feel that you're  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:43):**  running stuff from the center on those five farms? Or is it that there is, you know, a kind of a set  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:49):**  of principles and an ideology that's been established by you, a way of working that's  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:54):**  then delegated out to those different units and the different members of the family that are  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:31:58):**  running those different units? Great question. And I invite people to come see our Monday morning  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:05):**  management meeting. So we start Monday morning about six o'clock, six thirty. We're a formal  
**[0:32:09-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:09):**  meeting in our office with about 10 to 12 key players. And, you know, three of those are  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:17):**  our Joseph, Christian and Vanessa, our three oldest married children who work for us full time.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:23):**  And then there's other folks in there, longtime employees and trusted employees. And one fellow  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:32):**  from the A branch. So we kind of coordinate our to do list. Everybody's got three or four pages  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:39):**  of things to do short term, long term. And we're finding out what the construction guys are doing.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:45):**  We do all our own maintenance and what they're doing with the feed, irrigation. Right now we  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:51):**  irrigate and we're harvesting a haylage. And, you know, how many truckloads of grain did we get  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:32:57):**  hauled last week? We run about 10 trucks. Our son Christian manages that. And then we're hauling  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:02):**  milk all over the rest of the United States. And that's a complex equation. Both Joseph and  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:08):**  Christian manage that. So everybody knows what everyone else is doing. And so then after that,  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:12):**  we go have breakfast at our house and an A branch meeting usually at 11. And then really in a lot of  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:19):**  ways I'm done for the week by then. And that's crazy. That's a crazy thought. Now I can go drive  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:24):**  around my little old pickup with a Thistle hoe and go cut weeds and answer the phone.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:29):**  So of course you've got the certification, which is underpinning all of this stuff, but really it's  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:34):**  the success of this really very large business, certainly by UK standards, is because there is  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:41):**  this sense of responsibility, this sense of working together, of shared ownership that  
**[0:33:45-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:45):**  seems to permeate through your business. Right, exactly.  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:48):**  Bryce, you're at the point where your own farm is a success and now you two want to scale.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:54):**  Why do you want to grow and what are the barriers to making that step change for you?  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:33:58):**  Yes, you're absolutely right. We do have a passion to grow. The reason we want to grow goes back to,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:04):**  you know, that time that basically the farm had collapsed. You know, I'd lost my father and my two  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:09):**  grandparents. The business was upside down and the bank had pulled out. But we weren't the only  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:14):**  small family farming through that in the area at the time. So pretty much all of my father's  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:19):**  closest friends who are dairy farmers are now no longer dairy farmers. About 20 years ago,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:23):**  I think it was, there was around about 8,000 dairy farms in Scotland. There's now about 800.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:28):**  And I think that's a crying shame. I think that the international audience of Scotland think that,  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:34):**  you know, dairy in Scotland should be sort of smaller scale, regenerative. I think that's the  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:39):**  view that Scotland puts out there, I think is that of a grass fed nation, you know, of the highlands,  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:44):**  of things like that. And I think that we really are in danger of losing that as a nation. And so  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:49):**  I believe that for us, because we have been able to grow to the scale we are today, although it's  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:54):**  still very small in the industry, I think that we've, you know, we are putting a challenge up.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:34:57):**  And I felt that we had two options. We could either stay the size we were in 2018 with 40 or  
**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:03):**  50 cows and sell to our local community. And that was that. Or we could take our consumers and the  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:09):**  farmers on a journey and show that the farmers didn't just have to sell to a commodity market,  
**[0:35:14-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:14):**  and the consumers didn't just have to buy a plastic bottle of milk and a supermarket shelf,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:18):**  we could do something very different, have this connection. We quite often say we want fairness  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:23):**  from grass to glass. And that's absolutely true. We want fairness in our economy, fairness in our  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:28):**  environment and fairness in the social aspects of everything that we do. And that's why we want to  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:33):**  grow. Now growth for us looks like what we have done in the past. So we've recently been able to  
**[0:35:38-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:38):**  supply a local authority contract with milk that has zero plastic packaging. So we basically have  
**[0:35:45-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:45):**  put small vending machines in 50 schools locally around the farm. We're delivering that with  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:51):**  battery electric vehicles and we're using local people to deliver that as well. So that's part  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:35:55):**  of our vision. And that's what we're looking to grow. Now the challenge for us is the fact that,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:00):**  you know, as I keep mentioning five, six years ago we were bust. What we're doing is so different to  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:06):**  the industry norm that financiers are quite often turned off by it. And because we've not been able  
**[0:36:10-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:10):**  to borrow money, it's been a case of, you know, let's sell that and let's use that money to buy  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:14):**  something else and then buy something else. So we've never shown incredibly strong profits.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:19):**  That kind of changed for us in 2021, where we were able to show a good, not strong,  
**[0:36:25-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:25):**  particularly strong profits, but we were able to show that we could be profitable  
**[0:36:28-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:28):**  and that our outlook was far better. And we were able to show that through the use of  
**[0:36:34-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:34):**  renewable technology. So our scale went against us in the fact that we couldn't deliver costs.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:39):**  So we had to look differently. We had to look at renewable technology, lowering the temperature,  
**[0:36:43-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:43):**  we pasteurised the milk to allow us to use biomass technology and just using different  
**[0:36:47-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:47):**  efficiency models that other dairies weren't looking at. And that allowed us to grow to where  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:51):**  we are today and give us the sort of outlook that we're looking for. Now fortunately, there are some  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:36:57):**  financier out there that are willing to look at it for us, but we're certainly not getting mainstream  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:01):**  banks looking to bite our hand off to support a tenant farm that's pretty small in the industry.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:06):**  So yes, we're having some very exciting conversations with some investors,  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:11):**  but no one has bitten yet. But I do believe that the future of what we are trying to do in Scotland  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:16):**  is quite significant. And I do see a growing trend of people looking to support this way of agriculture.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:22):**  And of course, the way that you're doing things is climate friendly, it's restoring biodiversity,  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:27):**  it's helping to improve food security and resilience. And so the likelihood is that,  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:32):**  you know, these financial institutions, they will catch up with you at some point, even if  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:37):**  it isn't tomorrow. And I just wonder in terms of the way that you're thinking of expanding Bryce,  
**[0:37:43-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:43):**  whether you see this as an expansion of Bryce Cunningham's enterprise at Moscow with control  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:50):**  from the centre, or whether it's more expansion by replication, more of a cooperative model where  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:55):**  you're, as you have done with those four organic farms where you're managing the distribution,  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:37:59):**  where you're sort of, you're finding more farms that are working with you to achieve  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:05):**  expansion of the brand. Absolutely. We do see the future as a cooperative. So right now,  
**[0:38:11-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:11):**  the four farms we buy from, they're actually part of a cooperative called Omsco. You know,  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:16):**  we've had opportunities to go direct to farm, buy milk from them and do this, that and the next  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:20):**  thing, but we didn't want to, we wanted to remain part of the cooperative. And the reason for that  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:25):**  is I believe firmly and so I could walk out that door tomorrow and have a heart attack, I could be  
**[0:38:30-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:30):**  hit by a bus, I could be run over by a bull, you know, that's happened before I've been in hospital  
**[0:38:33-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:33):**  because of a bull hit me. So anything could happen to me, but it's not me that's going to take this  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:38):**  business forward. It's going to be the community, it's going to be the consumer, it's going to be  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:41):**  the farmers. I just believe that the vision of Omsco, you know, it can grow and grow and grow  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:46):**  and I believe that the way the future's coming and the way that people are talking nowadays,  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:50):**  I believe it's one of the only options out there to grow sustainably.  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:53):**  Thank you both. This has been so interesting, but Blake, just before we finish, I want to come back  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:38:58):**  to something that you implied earlier, started talking about in terms of your motivation for  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:04):**  being regenerative. Now you're a Christian and this is an important part of your personal and  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:09):**  family heritage. And I wonder how does your Christianity affect the decisions that you've  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:14):**  taken on your farm from the way that you manage your soil to the way that you manage your people?  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:18):**  When our children were little, we sent them to a Christian church again, you know, five kids that  
**[0:39:23-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:23):**  were born in a nine-year period. And I remember there was little rubber bracelets that they used  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:30):**  to wear coming home from school and church and said, you know, what would Jesus do? And so I  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:36):**  think that's really where I got this philosophy about do the right thing at every turn. I think  
**[0:39:40-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:40):**  that's what Jesus would do. And so that along with this motivation to get into organics and  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:47):**  understand it and then how do we make it work because everybody knows that when you, you know,  
**[0:39:52-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:52):**  kind of leave the industrial conventional model of farming, your yields are going to go down.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:39:58):**  And, you know, that happens generally when you have a broken system, I think, or a not sustainable  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:05):**  method and system. And so as we learn that, wow, it doesn't have to happen, and it doesn't take  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:11):**  10 years to recover land, you can do it in two or three when you understand the system. And the  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:16):**  system is all there and God gave us dominion over the animals and the birds, the fish, you know,  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:23):**  everything, all the creepy crawlers and the earth, the earth, Mother Earth is, it's biblical to take  
**[0:40:29-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:29):**  care of it. And it's the earth's job, the soil's job to be the womb of whatever we plant and  
**[0:40:37-0:40:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:37):**  harvest. And that's there for mankind to take advantage of, in a sense, not in a corrupt way,  
**[0:40:44-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:44):**  but to feed each other and to work. And so it really hurts me to see neighbors and neighbors  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:51):**  are in other states or on the other side of the fence, harming their soil in a way that it's  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:40:57):**  harming their checkbook, and it's harming the people that are trying to live and eat off that  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:02):**  farm. And so, you know, this is a way for us to get back to the Garden of Eden, in a sense, where  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:09):**  plants grew to the maximum potential and the earth wasn't corrupted or possessed in a negative way.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:15):**  And so just really trying to bring everything back in harmony, and harmony is when nature and  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:21):**  the environment, you know, we're sequestering carbon and we're breathing clean air. That's,  
**[0:41:26-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:26):**  and that's, for me, that's all biblically based and it just makes sense. And so it feels good.  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:30):**  I think that's how that plays into our Christian roots, in a sense.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:34):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:34):**  Thanks so much, Blake. That's clearly such a big motivator for you. And Bryce,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:39):**  I'm going to put you on the spot here because, you know, you have gone through such an upheaval  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:44):**  in terms of, you know, where the farm was seven years ago and where you've got it to now,  
**[0:41:49-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:49):**  the decisions that you've taken. And you must have been through some really low points as well as,  
**[0:41:55-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:41:55):**  you know, the higher points that you're at now. What is it that's driven you? What's the thing  
**[0:42:00-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:00):**  that's made you want to do what you do now? Blake  
**[0:42:29-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:29):**  You know, I had all these things ringing true in my head and I thought, you know what, no,  
**[0:42:32-0:42:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:32):**  that doesn't feel right. What felt right was how my grandfather farmed in 1948 when it came to  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:37):**  Miskiil. It had no chemical fertilisers, the tractor was a new invention, you know,  
**[0:42:41-0:42:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:41):**  they didn't have the massive compaction, the massive issues, the massive single crops that  
**[0:42:46-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:46):**  we have today. And I thought, you know, let's just do it. It feels right. We're going to do it.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:49):**  And thankfully for us, we've been supported by an incredible amount of customers for that. And  
**[0:42:53-0:42:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:53):**  we're going to grow the business off the back of that as well. So, yeah, that's one for me.  
**[0:42:56-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:56):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:42:57):**  thanks so much, both of you. That's bringing us to the end of the program with that really  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:43:01):**  sort of personal take on regenerative farming and on your own motivations.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-dairy-e1m36t3#t=0:43:05):**  That's all we have time for. It's been absolutely fascinating to talk to you both. I'd like to thank

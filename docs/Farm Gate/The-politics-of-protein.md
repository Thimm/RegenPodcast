### Farm Gate  (Thu, 07 Apr 2022 07:04:24)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke Stain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:09):**  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. In this programme we're talking about meat,  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:14):**  fish and protein alternatives and the competing claims about sustainability that are made  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:20):**  by individuals and vested interests across the food sector and around the world.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:24):**  IPES Food has launched a new report on the subject entitled The Politics of Protein and  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:30):**  today I'm joined from the USA by lead author Phil Howard and from Brussels by the director  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:35):**  of IPES Food, Nick Jacobs. Phil Howard is from Michigan State University and he's  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:40):**  an expert in food system changes and the visualisation of these trends and he's authored prominent  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:45):**  contributions to the public debate on concentration and power in modern food systems. Nick Jacobs  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:51):**  is a specialist in agri-food and trade and development policy and has worked with the  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:56):**  UN's Special Rapporteur on the right to food. Welcome both. Thanks Finn Loke, great to be  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:01):**  here. Yeah, thanks for having us. Phil, let me come to you first. The new IPES Food report  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:05):**  is called The Politics of Protein, examining claims about livestock, fish, alternative  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:11):**  proteins and sustainability. What's it particularly addressing? Yeah, this report addresses claims  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:17):**  that are frequently made and frequently amplified in relation to higher protein foods. So this  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:23):**  includes animal source foods such as meat, dairy, eggs and seafood, as well as new alternatives  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:29):**  such as highly processed plant-based substitutes and lab-grown versions of these products.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:34):**  So what we examine in this report is who is making these claims, what problems and solutions  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:39):**  are highlighted and importantly what is left out when these claims are oversimplified.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:45):**  There's a risk that policymakers will react to these claims by moving from inaction to  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:50):**  misguided actions, such as subsidising and reinforcing power-dominant firms, and these  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:55):**  are the same firms that substantially contributed to the problems in the first place. So Nick,  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:00):**  why was this project necessary and how does it fit in with the other work that's been  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:04):**  undertaken recently by IPES Food? Yeah, well I think the problems with meat and livestock  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:10):**  almost speak for themselves and you know this is such a crucial, such an urgent topic. I  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:15):**  find you know one data point particularly compelling, up to 80% of farmland globally  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:20):**  is taken up by livestock production and feed production to feed those animals. So it's  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:25):**  crystal clear at this point that if we're going to address the many sustainability challenges  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:29):**  we face, we have to look at our animal production systems. But we also saw that in this debate  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:35):**  there are lots and lots of misleading claims and we wanted to challenge that. And I think  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:39):**  you know this fits very much into the work that IPES Food does because we've always been  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:43):**  focused on power and the political economy of food systems. If you think you know how  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:47):**  does power play out, very often it plays out through kind of discourse and narratives and  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:52):**  it's really about you know who sets the terms of debate. So if we look at the big claims  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:56):**  that are being made about meat and protein, you know people telling us you should be eating  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:00):**  this, we shouldn't, we should be doing that, we found it really important to kind of rewind  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:04):**  and say well why are we discussing it in these terms? In whose interests is it to discuss  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:09):**  it in those terms? You know based on what assumptions and what worldviews. And you know  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:13):**  to put it simply, if big companies succeed in making this a debate between a kind of  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:17):**  a beef burger on one hand and an impossible burger, plant-based burger on the other hand,  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:22):**  then our view is that they've won already because that's a very reductive way of looking  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:26):**  at this question. And so we are concerned really was that that is the dominant way that  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:31):**  this huge area, this huge complex set of questions is being addressed and we wanted to rewind  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:36):**  and say well hang on, there are some other questions here that are being placed outside  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:39):**  the frames.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:40):**  I like the way that you've sort of framed that, so it's a boxing match between big meat  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:44):**  on one side and big alt meat on the other side. And of course you know you talk there  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:49):**  about the range of different viewpoints which are being driven by a whole range of different  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:55):**  sort of purposes and money and power being sort of intrinsic to that. So you've got the  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:58):**  farmers and suppliers and science and politics and everyone's telling us something slightly  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:03):**  different and it seems to me that one of the key takeaways is that if someone tells you  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:07):**  there's a simple answer in terms of food production and agricultural land use, then they're either  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:11):**  lying or they're just not thinking about it hard enough. Would that be fair?  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:15):**  I don't think we would say that they're lying per se. And you know in this report we look  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:19):**  at eight different claims that are being made in these areas and you know one of those is  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:23):**  about the benefits of these alternative proteins. Another claim is about you know the impact  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:29):**  of meat on our health. Many claims about what the solution should be from you know techno  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:33):**  fixes through to large scale aquaculture. And actually I don't think that in any case  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:39):**  we're able to conclude that this is kind of patently true or false. In almost every case  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:44):**  it depends and it depends on the context and I think that that's a really crucial word  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:48):**  in this report. And you know these claims are not lying per se but they're certainly  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:52):**  not painting the full picture. And sometimes you know that reductivism comes in many different  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:57):**  forms. Sometimes we're just focusing on protein which is really one nutrient among many. And  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:02):**  in reality you know animals are much more than meat and meat is much more than protein  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:07):**  in terms of what it yields and its various impacts. In other cases we're focusing just  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:12):**  on greenhouse gases as the main impact area. But as we know sustainability is actually  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:17):**  much broader than greenhouse gases, more than just carbon. In other cases we're narrowing  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:23):**  the lens by looking only at the effects in the here and now. And what we've tried to  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:27):**  do in the report is show that with some of these solutions that are being rolled out  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:31):**  there could be negative effects, knock on effects that play out over a longer time span.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:35):**  So I think in addressing these claims we were trying to unpack that.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:39):**  So if lying is too strong a word then perhaps spin is a better word. That this selectivity  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:45):**  of the truth, it's not that people are lying but they are being highly selective in the  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:50):**  truths that they put forward. Which essentially means that we've got to fight through the  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:55):**  spin and of course that's what your report is doing. So Phil you've built the report  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:59):**  around these eight claims that Nick just talked to us about. And you take each at face value,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:04):**  break it down and then challenge the parts. And I wonder why and how you chose those eight  
**[0:06:10-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:10):**  claims that you have chosen in particular.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:12):**  Yeah we started with an extensive literature review and identified the claims that we were  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:17):**  seeing most frequently. Even if we see them using slightly different words. So we looked  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:22):**  at mainstream media outlets, particularly the agenda setting media, as well as public  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:27):**  discussions of civil society organizations and government policy makers. And these eight  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:33):**  claims in particular were selected by members of our expert panel as being really influential  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:38):**  and deserving of further unpacking. And then we took those claims and we phrased them as  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:43):**  succinctly and as fairly as possible before we did that. We sifted through an enormous  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:48):**  amount of claims in this space and these are the ones that just kept keep coming up.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:53):**  So in terms of the report structure, four of the claims address problems with the supply  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:58):**  chain, while four of them address so-called solutions. Can we start with the problems?  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:02):**  The first claim of which is that we need more protein to meet the needs of a growing population.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:08):**  Is that not the case? And if it's not true then who's been telling us that it is?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:12):**  We've been hearing this message for decades. Decades ago, nutritionists were telling us  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:16):**  that some populations needed more protein and a lot of development efforts through the  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:21):**  1970s and sometimes even beyond frequently focused on providing protein. Research since  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:28):**  then however, has overwhelmingly found that people who are deficient in protein are almost  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:33):**  always deficient in other nutrients as well. So we're not seeing a protein gap, we're seeing  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:39):**  a food gap. But we're also given this message by advocates of fad diets such as paleo, keto,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:45):**  Atkins. But probably most importantly, this message is amplified by meat processing firm  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:51):**  executives who are often giving some version of the claim that protein production needs  
**[0:07:56-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:56):**  to double by the year 2050. Even though most people in the world consume more than enough  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:03):**  protein, these executives find it in their interest to promote higher levels of consumption,  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:08):**  excessive amounts and they deflect attention away from the inequitable distribution of  
**[0:08:12-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:12):**  food in general.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:13):**  So that claim about the need to double protein consumption by 2050 is very much based on  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:18):**  the idea that there will be a spread around the world of a Western diet and that there  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:24):**  will be no political attempts to arrest that or to manage that.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:28):**  I think that's fair and I think these firms are even reinforcing those trends by promoting  
**[0:08:34-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:34):**  those types of consumption patterns.  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:36):**  Is there a difference between, for example, the global south versus places like the US?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:41):**  Is there a discrepancy in terms of perhaps there is a need for more protein in one place  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:45):**  and less protein in another, or is it just actually that there needs to be more diversity  
**[0:08:50-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:50):**  across the board?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:51):**  I would lean towards more diversity across the board because if you look at the particular  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:56):**  parts of the world that lack protein, they're also lacking a number of other micronutrients.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:01):**  So it's pretty difficult to find a population that is only lacking in protein.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:06):**  It just coincides with a lack of access to food and diverse food sources in general.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:11):**  If I could add to what Phil just said, part of the problem is that when people are making  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:15):**  this claim that we need to double protein production by 2050 or whichever date it's  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:20):**  given, they very often go on to propose specific solutions, whether it's alternative proteins  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:25):**  or ramping up meat and dairy production globally.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:29):**  And the types of solutions that they have in mind are not going to be the solutions  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:33):**  that actually get more protein, more micronutrients to the people who really need them.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:38):**  As Phil has mentioned, this is mostly a distributional question.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:41):**  It's linked to poverty and access.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:43):**  We really need to be looking at solutions that help improve the livelihoods of farmers  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:48):**  in the global south and ensure that people have access to a diversity of foods.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:53):**  So arguing that we need more protein on a global level isn't really helpful in that  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:57):**  regard and it's actually quite distracting from the real problems in the global south.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:01):**  And in fact, it is quite distorting in particular around climate change and climate mitigation,  
**[0:10:05-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:05):**  isn't it?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:06):**  For example, that there are really quite senior people in the world like Bill Gates and Cristiano  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:10):**  Figueres who invested in things like the Impossible Burger and this kind of idea that the fastest  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:17):**  way to reduce climate change emissions is to cut the amount of livestock and to increase  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:23):**  the amount of alternative meat.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:25):**  That's certainly a narrative that's taken hold.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:27):**  And I think it often comes from a good place.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:30):**  It comes from genuine concerns about the sustainability of our livestock systems.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:34):**  It comes from a very real sense of urgency that I think we all have.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:39):**  But kind of embedded in that approach is this sense that we need more protein, whatever  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:43):**  the cost.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:44):**  And I think that does come back to some misconceptions and it's really been internalized in the way  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:49):**  we think about this.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:50):**  And you just see many studies designed in a very narrow way just to measure how much  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:55):**  protein do these different products give us for how much CO2, how many greenhouse gases  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:00):**  without considering how that food is produced beyond greenhouse gas emissions and without  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:05):**  considering this question of access and how is this food actually going to get to the  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:09):**  people who need it.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:10):**  You could imagine, you know, we could triple, quadruple the production of plant-based substitute  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:15):**  burgers in laboratories in the US and Europe.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:18):**  But are those really going to be at an affordable price for poor consumers in Africa?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:21):**  And I think, you know, what we worry about here is that what's more likely than them  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:26):**  having access to that food is actually that there would be negative knock-on effects on  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:29):**  livestock farming in the global south, which is often a lifeline for poorer communities.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:34):**  So the message that we need less livestock, but more protein is not really in sync with  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:39):**  the realities of countries in the global south, the realities of food security there.  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:43):**  I'm going to stick on this idea of power, Nick, and this idea that narratives are being  
**[0:11:48-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:48):**  successfully fueled by large, powerful individuals or corporations links, to me, it seems to  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:53):**  claim seven, which is a solution that technological advances can rapidly reduce the negative impacts  
**[0:12:00-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:00):**  of livestock.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:01):**  Now, much as new technology can offer super helpful things to do in all systems, this  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:06):**  claim has always seemed to me to be a justification for the most intensive livestock producers  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:11):**  to carry on with business as usual.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:13):**  What does the report find and does this claim stack up?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:16):**  So first of all, just to explain a bit what we're talking about here, when we talk about  
**[0:12:20-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:20):**  these techno fixes that are being put forward, we're talking about things like methane digesters,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:26):**  livestock vaccines, new breeding approaches, when animals are being bred to be more tolerant  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:31):**  of specific conditions, whether that's heat or confinement, and systems based on kind  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:36):**  of generating real time data, even pig facial recognition technologies are being put out  
**[0:12:42-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:42):**  there.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:43):**  Lots of digital solutions generally packaged together as kind of precision livestock.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:49):**  Once again, this claim is neither true nor false.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:52):**  But we've dug down into this and really looked at these solutions and asked, what are these  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:57):**  solutions to and for whom and for how long will they actually be solutions?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:01):**  And you know, a first kind of key thing to note here is that these technology led solutions  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:07):**  overwhelmingly designed for bigger, very highly capitalized farms, and arguably only really  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:12):**  viable for those farms.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:14):**  So if you take the case of these anaerobic digesters to capture methane, it's a big plank  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:19):**  of the kind of response to, you know, livestock emissions in the US being rolled out, subsidized  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:25):**  in California, and I think, soon across the US.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:27):**  But the cost of these things is something like, you know, three to $5 million.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:32):**  This is just not going to be viable for smaller units, even with subsidies, and you need to  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:35):**  be producing at a huge scale to really then capture those benefits.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:39):**  So again, it's not to say that this has no value, but to be clear that this is a specific  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:43):**  solution for a specific type of farm, and it's likely to be reinforcing that pressure  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:47):**  to farm at a large scale, something we would argue is really the root of many other problems.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:53):**  There's also the problem that a number of these technological solutions are actually about increasing the density  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:59):**  and the genetic uniformity of livestock units, and they offer new tools for maybe monitoring  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:04):**  the risks that come with that.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:05):**  For us, that's really not a solution that's going to work in the longer term.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:08):**  It's just kicking the can down the road.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:10):**  Those are the conditions that allow diseases to proliferate and create the big waste flows  
**[0:14:15-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:15):**  that are such a problem.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:16):**  Mason, thanks very much for that.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:17):**  I'm going to push back slightly because there is a danger of sounding anti-technology when  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:22):**  we're talking about these sorts of issues.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:24):**  There are many technologies that can be helpful for really small scale producers as well.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:29):**  There are things like selective breeding, which have been around for as long as agriculture  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:33):**  has existed.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:35):**  Even things like facial recognition, there can be some real benefits.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:39):**  I've seen facial recognition systems working on sheep.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:42):**  They're able to recognise a pre-manifestation of a health problem that a farmer might not  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:47):**  notice themselves for a few more days, and that can make the difference between a foot  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:51):**  disease running rampant through a flock or being captured and caught and treated at a  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:56):**  very early stage before it's moved even from a single animal.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:00):**  I agree, Finlow, and I think there are many positive examples of technologies being integrated  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:06):**  at appropriate scales.  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:07):**  And our view is certainly not that all of these should be avoided.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:10):**  I think one thing we're concerned about is that technological innovations are constantly  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:14):**  elevated ahead of social innovations and are constantly used, I think, to avoid the more  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:19):**  profound discussion that's needed about how to redesign systems, how to get away from  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:23):**  this uniformity that creates so many problems in the first place.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:27):**  So there clearly is a kind of a path dependency problem here where farms take on so many of  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:32):**  these technologies that they're really obliged to farm at a certain scale in a certain way  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:36):**  that doesn't allow some of the bigger changes and the kind of redesign, reintegration of  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:41):**  crops and livestock, for example, that could lead to many efficiencies.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:46):**  Another issue we raise here is that these technologies are so hyped that we often just  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:50):**  focus on the positives and don't pay enough attention to the risks.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:53):**  And in some cases, those risks are manageable.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:56):**  And in some cases, they're not.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:57):**  And they don't accrue quickly enough for us to really see the problems.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:00):**  And if you take breeding approaches, I think this is a good example where we have this  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:03):**  constant pressure towards new breeding approaches to increase productivity.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:08):**  But it's pushing in a direction that just can't be sustained.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:10):**  And you know, the push, for example, to have laying hens that produce larger eggs over  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:14):**  a longer time period, we see that that leads to, you know, recurrent keelbone fractures,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:19):**  and it's neither humane, nor is it productive in the long term.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:22):**  There's also the example of the double muscled Belgian blue beef, that's a cattle breed that,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:27):**  you know, has been touted for its ability to improve the muscle structure, deliver high  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:31):**  yields, but over time, it's clear that this leads to a higher risk of genetic disorders,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:36):**  higher mortality of animals.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:37):**  So if you look at, you know, the whole picture, I think a lot of these technologies over time  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:42):**  do not deliver the benefits they're supposed to.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:45):**  What we're arguing, first of all, we're arguing here just for more scrutiny of these technologies  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:49):**  and to really have a sense of how they're going to support the transition farmers need  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:54):**  to make.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:55):**  I think that's really interesting.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:56):**  I like the way again, that you framed that because it's about looking to see whether  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:59):**  these, for example, the genetics improvements, the breeding improvements are going to benefit  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:04):**  the animal or adjust there to kind of force the animal ever more into a system that the  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:10):**  animal should never have existed in the first place.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:13):**  Phil, one of the areas that's particularly interesting is the claim around alternative  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:18):**  proteins or alt meats as a solution.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:20):**  And you framed the claim as alternative proteins are a win, win, win for animals, people and  
**[0:17:26-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:26):**  the planet.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:27):**  Now, as we've already discussed, we know that there is a need to shift to more sustainable  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:31):**  food systems and that this means a transition from a cheap oversupply of industrially produced  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:37):**  food to extensive and land appropriate food production.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:40):**  So in terms of delivering that narrative, are there any ways that you think that alternative  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:46):**  proteins can work as a transitional bridge away from excessive, excessive meat and dairy  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:51):**  consumption?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:52):**  Yeah, that's the message we hear frequently that it's a win, win, win.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:56):**  And there, there is an element that these can be helpful, but the ones that are receiving  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:01):**  the most hype are the ones that are most processed and have ultra processed ingredients.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:07):**  And this claim rests on some shaky foundations already.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:10):**  We've already talked about the idea that people need to consume a lot more protein and they  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:14):**  don't.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:15):**  Another is that dietary habits are quite resistant to change and that a substitute with nearly  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:21):**  identical taste is needed.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:22):**  But what this does in fact is reinforce a center of the plate diet that emphasizes either  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:28):**  meat or a highly processed substitute.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:30):**  And it does steer people away from more diverse and less processed diets often without even  
**[0:18:35-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:35):**  actually reducing meat and dairy consumption.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:38):**  And these firms are quite capable of driving rapid shifts in diets.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:42):**  So there was the innovation of fish sticks, for example, which was promoted as a way to  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:47):**  deal with the surplus of large blocks of frozen fish.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:50):**  And now it's a very common element in many people's diets.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:53):**  But unfortunately, diverse and less processed diets are not as profitable and therefore  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:58):**  they receive far, far less investment.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:00):**  And it's really clear as well from your work because, you know, your specialism is visualization  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:05):**  and the visualizations in this report are really helpful, really good stuff.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:09):**  And you can see the amount of money that is being put in by companies that currently specialize  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:15):**  in livestock and livestock processing like Tyson Foods that are now putting so much money  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:21):**  into these alternative proteins, which suggests that it's not about trying to help a transition  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:27):**  to a more climate and environmentally friendly way of eating.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:31):**  It's just about maintaining profits.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:33):**  Yeah, and they're doing a nice job of covering their bases and make sure they have hands  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:37):**  in all of those alternatives that are being pushed by other people as alternatives to  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:43):**  the products that they first specialized in.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:45):**  One of the things that makes us very skeptical about the sustainability credentials of these  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:50):**  alternative proteins is the fact that, you know, these same companies coming from the  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:55):**  meat and dairy sectors are moving into this sector.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:58):**  Replacing meat with plant-based ingredients is not the solution in of itself.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:02):**  It all depends on how those ingredients are produced.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:04):**  And what we're concerned about here is that the kind of the many ingredients, plant-based  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:08):**  ingredients that will be going into these substitute products are actually going to  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:12):**  be sourced from the same kind of chemical intensive monoculture systems that we see  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:16):**  today, including for the production of feed for livestock.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:19):**  A lot of the comparisons are more nuanced and some of the claims are not nuanced and  
**[0:20:24-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:24):**  we'll say this is going to be a win-win-win.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:26):**  But when you look at some of the studies done, the sustainability benefits of these alternative  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:30):**  products really depends on what ingredients are used.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:33):**  And you know, one study found that substitutes that are based on soy and wheat don't offer  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:37):**  the same benefits as ones that are based on something like lupin.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:41):**  And then, you know, a lot of these substitutes use coconut and palm oil as key ingredients.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:45):**  And these are commodities that are associated with deforestation, generally farmed in an  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:49):**  unsustainable way.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:51):**  So just shifting from meat to non-meat inputs is not a guarantee of sustainability in of  
**[0:20:55-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:55):**  itself.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:56):**  But from a pure company perspective, it's not necessarily an unreasonable thing to do  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:00):**  if you feel like your business is being pilloried from a range of different quarters because  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:06):**  you're producing too much livestock to start supplying something else.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:09):**  But I guess the message is the same in both directions.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:13):**  Whether you're continuing to produce livestock or producing these alt-meat products, the  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:17):**  source material, the animal or the ingredients that are going into that alt-meat product  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:22):**  need to be from sustainable sources because otherwise all you're doing is simply displacing  
**[0:21:27-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:27):**  one problem by creating another.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:29):**  That's right.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:30):**  And I think, you know, first and foremost, we wanted people to know that this is happening  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:34):**  because when you're buying an alternative meat product, it's not clear these are the  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:38):**  same companies.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:39):**  And I think people might have the perception that they're buying something, you know, produced  
**[0:21:43-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:43):**  by startups or small businesses with very different supply chains.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:46):**  And that's certainly not the case.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:48):**  I think it's worth saying as well that the jury's still out.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:50):**  It's possible that these companies are not just diversifying, but they're really trying  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:54):**  to shift their business model.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:55):**  We just haven't seen much evidence to suggest that's the case.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:58):**  And I think, you know, there's a lot of evidence already before the alt-meat boom of these  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:03):**  big companies with problematic reputations trying to kind of change their image by buying  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:09):**  up sustainable brands, organic brands.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:12):**  So if you take JBS, the biggest meat company in the world, often pilloried for its practices,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:17):**  that's a company that owns, you know, 100 plus brands, including grass fed meat product

**[0:22:23-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:23):**  And, you know, the question is, is that, are they really investing in those things or are  
**[0:22:26-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:26):**  they trying to cover their bases and sort of greenwash their image?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:29):**  Jason Vale, The Guardian, Let's stay on that just for a moment, because  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:30):**  when money is controlled and power is contained by a relatively small number of people, I  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:36):**  wonder, is it even possible to deliver the integrated model of land use that's an essential  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:41):**  part of an agroecological approach to global food systems?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:45):**  Does that boardroom pressure always mean that there is going to be specialization that leads  
**[0:22:51-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:51):**  to an unsustainable approach?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:52):**  I think it's very difficult to imagine a kind of agroecological transformation with power  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:58):**  relations remaining as they currently are.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:00):**  I certainly don't think the impetus is going to come from the private sector and from those  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:05):**  big companies.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:06):**  When it does start to become possible and viable is when you think about shifting the  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:11):**  policy incentives.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:12):**  And that's really what's at play here.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:14):**  And there's so much lobbying right now about the future of these agricultural policies  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:18):**  and which types of models are going to be supported.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:21):**  And if you could imagine a big shift in agricultural subsidies, in agri-development funding, supporting  
**[0:23:26-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:26):**  credit for smallholders, allowing people to access land in different ways, coupled with  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:32):**  changes in the procurement practices of big retailers, then I think it does start to become  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:37):**  viable, because really all of those things need to change.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:40):**  And the current incentives are really stacked up in favor of producing specific commodities  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:45):**  at a large scale.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:47):**  And where are we?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:48):**  Because obviously you're in the EU, you're based in Brussels.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:50):**  And where are we now with Farm to Fork?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:52):**  What's happening there?  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:53):**  We're at a very perilous moment where the Farm to Fork strategy, which is still really  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:58):**  in its infancy, has just been adopted by the European Parliament, giving this new direction  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:04):**  for European agriculture, is being attacked and is being diluted thanks to very effective  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:11):**  agribusiness lobbying.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:12):**  In the face of the crisis coming out of Ukraine, the reality of global food prices increasing,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:17):**  we've seen some very vocal lobbying for this potentially transformative EU strategy to  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:23):**  be suspended on the grounds that farmers in Europe just need to produce more to feed the  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:28):**  world.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:29):**  That's a message that I think has plenty of holes in it, but it's been effective at this  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:33):**  moment and has responded to the kind of very real concerns around food price inflation  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:38):**  and what impact that's going to have on food security in Europe, in the Middle East, in  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:42):**  many other regions.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:43):**  I want to move on to Claim 6, which hones in on fishing and aquaculture, again controlled  
**[0:24:49-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:49):**  by enormous financial interests.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:52):**  There's a story being told that with wild fish capture stagnating, aquaculture production  
**[0:24:57-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:57):**  should be increasing.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:59):**  And yet the negative environmental and welfare impacts of large scale aquaculture, such as  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:02):**  salmon farming, are immense, while the positive impacts of smaller multi-trophic systems where  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:08):**  shellfish are integrated with kelp are yet to be scaled and require significant dietary  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:13):**  change from citizens as well.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:15):**  What are the main issues that you've come across in researching this report?  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:18):**  First of all, we found that there are huge generalisations in this area.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:23):**  And already when looking at livestock, we've sounded the alarm on the fact that livestock  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:27):**  is being treated as a single entity when you have this huge spectrum of impacts from industrial  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:32):**  through to small scale pastoralist forms of livestock.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:36):**  And with aquaculture, that's arguably even greater, where you have these centuries old  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:41):**  practices, multi-trophic level aquaculture, many integrated systems that are delivering  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:48):**  high quality food, healthy, nutritious food for populations who don't have access to many  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:54):**  other sources of protein, micronutrients.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:56):**  You also have extremely intensive single species systems focused on salmon, trout, other high  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:02):**  value fish, which have huge requirements in terms of feed, and that's very often fish  
**[0:26:09-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:09):**  feed.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:10):**  Sometimes it's crop based as well.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:11):**  So we hear that we need to shift from meat to farmed fish to reduce the pressures on  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:17):**  the land, but actually about 4% of global crops are fed to fish.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:21):**  So the impacts shift back onto the land there as well.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:24):**  So again, it really just depends on what models we're talking about.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:28):**  And we found these big generic claims about the need to scale up aquaculture.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:32):**  And clearly it's true that we do need to look to aquaculture as a potential solution.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:36):**  Fish does provide a lot of the protein intake for people around the world, but it all depends  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:41):**  on what type of aquaculture and what problems we're trying to solve.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:45):**  If our rationale is to take the pressure off wild fisheries, then it's really a problem  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:49):**  to be investing in this large scale single species, very intensive aquaculture, because  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:54):**  that is undermining wild fish populations through the pollution contamination you mentioned,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:59):**  Finlow, through the pressures on other species of fish that are required to feed those animals,  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:04):**  through the spread of diseases from fish escapes and the contamination that we discussed.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:10):**  In some of the cases we looked at, up to 90% of the fish that's being used as feed could  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:15):**  be used directly for human consumption.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:19):**  So if the underlying rationale here is food security, and we're saying we need to invest  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:23):**  in aquaculture to boost food security in the face of stagnating wild fish stocks, the best  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:29):**  way to undermine food security is to take food out of the hands of communities that  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:33):**  need it.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:34):**  And fishing those smaller species and shipping them across the world for farmed fish is surely  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:39):**  not an efficient use of resources and not a solution for food security in the longer  
**[0:27:43-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:43):**  term.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:44):**  Phil, when I was reading the report, I was struck by two claims that seemed to me to  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:47):**  be immediately diametrically opposed.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:50):**  For example, if claim three that livestock production is incompatible with climate and  
**[0:27:56-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:56):**  sustainability goals were true, then claim eight that regen livestock systems can solve  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:02):**  environmental problems like climate change and soil degradation must not be true.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:06):**  What did you discover about these claims?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:08):**  Yeah, these claims are made by different interest groups, so it's not surprising that they are  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:13):**  conflicting messages, but both are oversimplifications.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:16):**  So the claim that livestock production is incompatible with climate sustainability goals  
**[0:28:21-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:21):**  is focused quite narrowly on greenhouse gas emissions or even just carbon or methane,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:27):**  and it ignores enormous variation in production systems such as measuring only the impacts  
**[0:28:32-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:32):**  of industrial livestock operations.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:35):**  And the claim that regenerative approaches, which are very different, can solve all these  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:39):**  problems also focus on narrow measures such as carbon sequestration or increasing soil  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:44):**  organic matter, and on the basis of a very limited amount of evidence to date.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:49):**  So, that brings us on to an issue that I'd like to go into in a bit more detail, because  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:53):**  as I said, I think in general the report is excellent, but I do have one or two concerns,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:58):**  and one of them is around the fact that I think you're a bit too hard on regen agriculture.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:03):**  So let's talk about that.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:05):**  Regen is largely a movement of smaller producers who are working really hard to understand  
**[0:29:11-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:11):**  the land, to manage the land, and to look after natural resources as well as they possibly can.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:16):**  So when regenerative land management is a tool that can help deliver the agroecological  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:21):**  food systems that we all agree are so important, what is it about the regen movement that concerns  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:27):**  you?  
**[0:29:28-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:28):**  Because it seems to me that regen isn't part of the same sort of power and money challenge  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:34):**  that we've been talking about for so much of the rest of this programme.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:37):**  Yeah, but it's quickly getting there, because this movement's ideas have been significantly  
**[0:29:42-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:42):**  amplified by giant corporations like McDonald's, Arla, and General Mills.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:48):**  And I am sympathetic to many aspects of regenerative agriculture, but also concerned about the  
**[0:29:53-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:53):**  exaggeration of benefits, the minimising of complexities, uncertainties, and context,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:00):**  and particularly the lack of attention to social aspects of sustainability, such as  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:04):**  ethnic disparities and land ownership patterns, for example.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:08):**  And the idea of a simple management fix can be just as alluring as a techno fix, but as  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:13):**  Nick was saying earlier, it's a way of avoiding tough but needed conversations about the distribution  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:18):**  of power.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:19):**  So if we take one of those brands that you mentioned, Arla, for example, part of the  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:24):**  work that we're doing on regenerative dairy, and they're quite upfront about the fact that  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:28):**  regenerative agriculture is an ambition for them, which is why they're working with other  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:34):**  dairy companies and with groups like ourselves and FAI, in order to try and understand and  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:39):**  envision what regenerative dairy is and what it should look like, and then to develop pathways  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:45):**  to get there.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:46):**  And it seems to me that if Arla can manage to deliver that throughout its supply chain  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:51):**  with all of the farmers that are part of that brand, surely that would be a fantastic thing.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:56):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:57):**  It's just that the evidence so far hasn't caught up with that kind of claim.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:03):**  So for example, one of the questions that hasn't really been answered with the short-term  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:07):**  studies to date is how the benefits of soil sequestration will be made over time as peak  
**[0:31:13-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:13):**  soil organic carbon levels are reached.  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:15):**  When degraded land soils are restored with generative practices, there are some benefits,  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:20):**  but there's a debate over how long, whether or not soils will retain carbon if there's  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:25):**  not also sufficient nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur, and concerns that these minerals  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:30):**  may be better used to grow food than stored in soils.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:34):**  So that example that you've picked on is one of those where I feel like there is to a degree  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:38):**  an overstatement and the report says that reliable ways of measuring soil carbon sequestration  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:44):**  is still lacking, but I'm not sure that that's fair because there are a range of reliable  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:48):**  ways of measuring soil carbon.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:50):**  So surely the problem isn't so much about reliability and more about consistency and  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:55):**  transparency in terms of the methodology.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:57):**  Yeah, definitely.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:58):**  That's what we would all like to see is more consistency, more transparency.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:03):**  So by raising attention to this issue, hopefully, you know, that will bring some pressure to  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:09):**  move closer to that goal.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:10):**  One of the things that always concerns me when we're talking about soil carbon sequestration  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:15):**  is that, I mean, obviously, you know, to an extent, the measuring of soil carbon is in  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:19):**  a relative infancy in comparison with sequestering it in wood.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:23):**  But at the same time, there are similar challenges with wood when it comes to maintaining that  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:28):**  that sequestered asset over time because wood is vulnerable, particularly to things like  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:33):**  fires and drought where, you know, soils can die.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:37):**  And so we have these problems if we're talking about anything where we're trying to sequester  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:41):**  carbon.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:42):**  I mean, ultimately, we need to stop burning fossil fuels.  
**[0:32:43-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:43):**  I mean, that's, that's how we deal with these things.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:46):**  But in terms of a basic way of drawing carbon out of the air, which isn't super expensive,  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:52):**  doesn't require huge amounts of technology, both trees and soil surely are really good  
**[0:32:57-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:57):**  things in that narrative.  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:59):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:00):**  But there's a risk of overemphasizing and overpromising here.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:05):**  And when we do that, we take our eye off the ball.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:07):**  And I think there's a risk that other sectors that are truly extractive sectors get a free  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:11):**  lunch and there's less scrutiny of what they're doing.  
**[0:33:14-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:14):**  You know, for so long as people can believe that there's some kind of silver bullet solution,  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:19):**  whether it's a technology or whether it's the capacity of the soil to absorb infinite  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:23):**  carbon, there's a risk that we just carry on with business as usual.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:26):**  And I think that temptation is huge all the time to find solutions that allow us to carry  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:30):**  on more or less as we are now.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:32):**  So with Regenerative, it's just a question of finding that right balance and being clear  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:36):**  on the big potential, but also calling out the exaggerations when we hear them.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:41):**  And I think, you know, in this report, we've really been bounded by what the big players  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:45):**  are saying.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:46):**  And clearly, you know, we have big companies who are making big, bold promises on this  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:50):**  and then acknowledging kind of in the small print of their annual reports that they don't  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:53):**  really have the metrics to assess whether suppliers are doing it yet.  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:57):**  That's fine.  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:58):**  And it's good that they're acknowledging those things.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:00):**  But I think there's a disconnect there and it's possibly on purpose.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:04):**  And there's a big danger if we're all somehow led to believe that Big Ag and the food industry  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:09):**  has this under control, that they were emitting a lot, but they've got this great, you know,  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:14):**  set of regenerative solutions and they're on top of it and we can all relax and continue  
**[0:34:18-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:18):**  buying our products.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:20):**  And our concern always is that there's this bigger transformation that's needed on every  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:24):**  level.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:25):**  It's this redesign of the production system, the redesign of supply chains as well, and  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:29):**  people reconnecting with their food and asking these questions.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:32):**  And that's where that skepticism comes from.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:34):**  And when we see a term like regenerative being plastered all over products and, you know,  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:40):**  the names of conferences, we worry that the underlying goal is to make people take their  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:47):**  foot off the pedal and to distract from that broader transformation and to imply once again  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:53):**  that the industry is the driver of change, despite the fact that those metrics are not  
**[0:34:57-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:57):**  quite there yet.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:58):**  And often the real innovators are coming from the bottom up rather than the top down.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:03):**  Indeed, indeed.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:05):**  And you know, we see certainly with alternative proteins as well, the same parallel where  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:08):**  there's a lot of innovation at the ground level, startups doing really interesting things  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:13):**  and they're gradually bought up and then the types of innovation change.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:17):**  And there's a kind of standardized approach that sets in and probably more investment  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:21):**  then shifting to promoting what's being done rather than actually trying to make it work  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:25):**  on the ground.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:26):**  Nick, I'm pushing back a little bit because I just want to sort of test some of these  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:30):**  claims, but at the same time, I completely agree with you that it's really important  
**[0:35:34-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:34):**  to make sure that if claims are being made, that they do stack up.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:37):**  And clearly there is a danger that if regenerative agriculture does overclaim, then it's just  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:44):**  going to be branded as greenwash.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:46):**  And then, you know, nobody really benefits because the public don't understand, you know,  
**[0:35:51-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:51):**  what it is that they're getting.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:52):**  And you know, at this point in society's development, in human development, it's so important that  
**[0:35:58-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:58):**  if people are doing good, then it gets scaled in a good way so that we can trust whatever  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:04):**  it is that's coming as a result.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:05):**  Now, Nick, I wonder about the politics at this point of talking about the politics of  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:10):**  protein and what decisions you've taken as an expert group, because clearly I-PEST food  
**[0:36:15-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:15):**  isn't independent.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:16):**  You're very clearly in favor of agroecology.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:19):**  So how have you approached this project?  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:21):**  First of all, we really tried to take the claims at face value and to, you know, say  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:26):**  what is being claimed and what evidence is there in support of those arguments.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:31):**  So we're not, you know, holding people up against an impossible standard and saying,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:34):**  is this agroecological?  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:35):**  We're saying, you know, you're claiming that alternative proteins are going to save the  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:40):**  planet, etc.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:41):**  What evidence is there of that?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:42):**  Clearly, we do have a well documented worldview in the i-PEST food panel.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:47):**  We believe that in the medium to longer term, an agroecological transformation is needed.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:52):**  And you know, that does guide the types of questions we ask.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:55):**  So when we look at solutions like alternative proteins or techno fixes for livestock, we're  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:00):**  coming at that with a view that in the medium term or even sooner, power does need to be  
**[0:37:05-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:05):**  decentralized in food systems.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:07):**  We're coming with a view that the corporations that currently hold power in food systems  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:11):**  can't really be trusted to steer us in a very different direction.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:15):**  It's not really in their DNA.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:16):**  We're coming with a view that change needs to happen very fast, but also that it needs  
**[0:37:20-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:20):**  to be holistic through the food system, not just focused on one factor like greenhouse  
**[0:37:25-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:25):**  gas emissions.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:26):**  I think one way we address that as well was to ensure that we included claims that are  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:31):**  being made not just by big industry, but also by civil society groups and by health professionals  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:37):**  and by other people with whom we've broadly been in agreement in the past and would share  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:42):**  many of their concerns.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:43):**  And you know, we very robustly assess the claim in this report that red meat is bad  
**[0:37:48-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:48):**  for your health.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:49):**  And that's a claim made, I think, in good faith by lots of actors who are concerned  
**[0:37:54-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:54):**  about the health impacts of what we eat.  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:56):**  But there we were also willing to say, well, you know, the evidence in this area is very  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:01):**  complicated.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:02):**  As I say, I think it's a really helpful report in so many ways.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:06):**  The way that each of those claims has been deconstructed and visualized is really a really  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:11):**  helpful contribution.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:12):**  Just the final challenge really for me is that this report is clearly, it's a review  
**[0:38:17-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:17):**  of existing claims and a review of existing academic papers, information that's already  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:24):**  in the public domain.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:25):**  Now, something we've discussed on the podcast previously with IPES food experts like Jennifer  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:30):**  Clapp and Molly Anderson is the need to establish a better capacity to value experience and  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:36):**  practice at ground level alongside academic peer reviewed papers.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:41):**  And I wonder, Nick, if there is a danger that the report's approach to, for example, regen  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:46):**  agriculture, it's too embedded in academia when actually most of the knowledge of regen  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:51):**  is still out in the field.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:52):**  Yeah, that is a challenge.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:54):**  Indeed, in a paper like this, we were trying to be very comprehensive in reviewing the  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:59):**  evidence that's out there right now.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:01):**  We do always consider different types of evidence and we include, you know, so-called grey literature,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:06):**  papers by NGOs, social movements alongside academic literature.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:10):**  But I think indeed with regen, there's so much experimentation happening and I think  
**[0:39:15-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:15):**  it's so crucial for that to be able to happen.  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:18):**  And you know, that's probably, I think, one of our concerns when we talk about the  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:21):**  co-option of regenerative livestock, regenerative agriculture and the food industry being the  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:27):**  main mouthpiece for this at the moment.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:29):**  There needs to be this kind of farmer led experimentation on the ground with all different  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:33):**  ways of redesigning production systems, making them sustainable.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:37):**  Our concern is that an industry led version of regenerative agriculture might just become  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:42):**  another checklist, another set of things farmers need to do that don't really unleash their  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:47):**  potential to experiment and to work off of the research they're seeing.  
**[0:39:53-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:53):**  So, that's definitely a concern that we share.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:55):**  Phil, just coming back to you, having addressed these claims in the way that you have throughout  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:00):**  the report, the report comes to three clear conclusions.  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:04):**  And I wonder if you could just summarise these for us and then talk us through each one in  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:08):**  a little bit more detail.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:09):**  Yeah, our three recommendations are to first shift the focus away from a protein transition  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:15):**  to a holistic food system transitions and sustainable food policies.  
**[0:40:20-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:20):**  Second to prioritise territorial approaches to food system changes.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:25):**  And then the third recommendation is about the claims themselves to reclaim the debate  
**[0:40:29-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:29):**  from dominant meat and dairy processors and to have broader conversations, ones that involve  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:34):**  communities that currently have very little voice in the debates.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:38):**  So in other words, you know, Bill Gates has no problem getting out the message that he  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:42):**  thinks people in rich countries should eat synthetic beef, which happens to come from  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:47):**  firms that he has huge investments in.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:50):**  But we don't typically hear from small scale livestock or aquaculture producers in less  
**[0:40:55-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:55):**  affluent nations in particular.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:56):**  And if we did, there probably wouldn't be such an emphasis on this single macronutrient  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:01):**  of protein.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:02):**  We would hear much more of an emphasis on food or even the broader cultural significance  
**[0:41:07-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:07):**  of the animals that contribute to human diets.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:09):**  And we would also likely hear about the territorial differences that make global policy prescriptions  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:15):**  really problematic when applied to smaller producers and to more direct supply chains,  
**[0:41:20-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:20):**  particularly in the global south.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:21):**  Thanks so much for that, Phil.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:22):**  Now, Nick, how is it that the report's going to be used?  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:25):**  How do you think it's likely to be used by citizens and policymakers?  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:29):**  Yeah, I think this report is quite different to some of our other reports in that regard.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:35):**  We typically had some quite specific policy reforms in mind and put that forward.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:41):**  And in this case, Phil has discussed the recommendations we have.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:44):**  They're broad recommendations about reframing the debate.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:48):**  That's not to say that we are disinterested in the policy debates going on right now.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:53):**  And we start the report by saying, as we speak, there's significant lobbying going on to get  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:59):**  public support behind alternative proteins, whether it's research and development funding  
**[0:42:04-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:04):**  for lab-grown meat or promotional funds for fake meats.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:08):**  And that's really a huge stake right now with governments from the US to China to Denmark,  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:15):**  Germany readying quite significant investments in alternative proteins.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:20):**  So we're very clear in the report that we don't see a justification for public funding  
**[0:42:25-0:42:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:25):**  to go into these products at this stage.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:27):**  We don't see enough evidence of their potential to really transform food systems.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:31):**  We don't see enough evidence to justify this being considered in the public good per se.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:37):**  But here, yeah, the goals of the report are broader, you know, beyond influencing those  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:41):**  policy decisions.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:43):**  And first and foremost, we hope that the report will be a starting point for dialogue and  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:47):**  for kind of resetting the debate on these topics because they're just too polarized  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:51):**  right now.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:52):**  And you have livestock farmers on one hand, animal welfare activists on the other who  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:56):**  really aren't able to engage with each other on this topic.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:00):**  Commercial groups, nutritional groups, people with different interests who don't see enough  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:05):**  of the things they have in common on this topic.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:08):**  And you know, people rightly, I think, are unwilling to engage in debate if they think  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:12):**  that the outcome is already decided.  
**[0:43:14-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:14):**  So what we're hoping with this report, we're hoping that most groups can look at this and  
**[0:43:18-0:43:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:18):**  say, well, this is a fair, quite a fair assessment of different perspectives.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:22):**  I see that my worldview is at least taken into account here.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:25):**  Yeah, we're hoping to reset the debate in that way and help to overcome polarization.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:29):**  That's all we've got time for.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:31):**  It's been really interesting talking to you.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:33):**  So I'd like to thank my guests, Nick Jacobs and Phil Howard for my pest food.

**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke Stain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. In this programme we're talking about meat,  fish and protein alternatives and the competing claims about sustainability that are made  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:20):**  by individuals and vested interests across the food sector and around the world.  IPES Food has launched a new report on the subject entitled The Politics of Protein and  today I'm joined from the USA by lead author Phil Howard and from Brussels by the director  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:35):**  of IPES Food, Nick Jacobs. Phil Howard is from Michigan State University and he's  an expert in food system changes and the visualisation of these trends and he's authored prominent  contributions to the public debate on concentration and power in modern food systems. Nick Jacobs  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:00:51):**  is a specialist in agri-food and trade and development policy and has worked with the  UN's Special Rapporteur on the right to food. Welcome both. Thanks Finn Loke, great to be  here. Yeah, thanks for having us. Phil, let me come to you first. The new IPES Food report  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:05):**  is called The Politics of Protein, examining claims about livestock, fish, alternative  proteins and sustainability. What's it particularly addressing? Yeah, this report addresses claims  that are frequently made and frequently amplified in relation to higher protein foods. So this  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:23):**  includes animal source foods such as meat, dairy, eggs and seafood, as well as new alternatives  such as highly processed plant-based substitutes and lab-grown versions of these products.  So what we examine in this report is who is making these claims, what problems and solutions  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:39):**  are highlighted and importantly what is left out when these claims are oversimplified.  There's a risk that policymakers will react to these claims by moving from inaction to  misguided actions, such as subsidising and reinforcing power-dominant firms, and these  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:01:55):**  are the same firms that substantially contributed to the problems in the first place. So Nick,  why was this project necessary and how does it fit in with the other work that's been  undertaken recently by IPES Food? Yeah, well I think the problems with meat and livestock  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:10):**  almost speak for themselves and you know this is such a crucial, such an urgent topic. I  find you know one data point particularly compelling, up to 80% of farmland globally  is taken up by livestock production and feed production to feed those animals. So it's  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:25):**  crystal clear at this point that if we're going to address the many sustainability challenges  we face, we have to look at our animal production systems. But we also saw that in this debate  there are lots and lots of misleading claims and we wanted to challenge that. And I think  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:39):**  you know this fits very much into the work that IPES Food does because we've always been  focused on power and the political economy of food systems. If you think you know how  does power play out, very often it plays out through kind of discourse and narratives and  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:02:52):**  it's really about you know who sets the terms of debate. So if we look at the big claims  that are being made about meat and protein, you know people telling us you should be eating  this, we shouldn't, we should be doing that, we found it really important to kind of rewind  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:04):**  and say well why are we discussing it in these terms? In whose interests is it to discuss  it in those terms? You know based on what assumptions and what worldviews. And you know  to put it simply, if big companies succeed in making this a debate between a kind of  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:17):**  a beef burger on one hand and an impossible burger, plant-based burger on the other hand,  then our view is that they've won already because that's a very reductive way of looking  at this question. And so we are concerned really was that that is the dominant way that  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:31):**  this huge area, this huge complex set of questions is being addressed and we wanted to rewind  and say well hang on, there are some other questions here that are being placed outside  the frames.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:40):**  I like the way that you've sort of framed that, so it's a boxing match between big meat  on one side and big alt meat on the other side. And of course you know you talk there  about the range of different viewpoints which are being driven by a whole range of different  
**[0:03:55-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:03:55):**  sort of purposes and money and power being sort of intrinsic to that. So you've got the  farmers and suppliers and science and politics and everyone's telling us something slightly  different and it seems to me that one of the key takeaways is that if someone tells you  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:07):**  there's a simple answer in terms of food production and agricultural land use, then they're either  lying or they're just not thinking about it hard enough. Would that be fair?  I don't think we would say that they're lying per se. And you know in this report we look  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:19):**  at eight different claims that are being made in these areas and you know one of those is  about the benefits of these alternative proteins. Another claim is about you know the impact  of meat on our health. Many claims about what the solution should be from you know techno  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:33):**  fixes through to large scale aquaculture. And actually I don't think that in any case  we're able to conclude that this is kind of patently true or false. In almost every case  it depends and it depends on the context and I think that that's a really crucial word  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:04:48):**  in this report. And you know these claims are not lying per se but they're certainly  not painting the full picture. And sometimes you know that reductivism comes in many different  forms. Sometimes we're just focusing on protein which is really one nutrient among many. And  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:02):**  in reality you know animals are much more than meat and meat is much more than protein  in terms of what it yields and its various impacts. In other cases we're focusing just  on greenhouse gases as the main impact area. But as we know sustainability is actually  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:17):**  much broader than greenhouse gases, more than just carbon. In other cases we're narrowing  the lens by looking only at the effects in the here and now. And what we've tried to  do in the report is show that with some of these solutions that are being rolled out  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:31):**  there could be negative effects, knock on effects that play out over a longer time span.  So I think in addressing these claims we were trying to unpack that.  So if lying is too strong a word then perhaps spin is a better word. That this selectivity  
**[0:05:45-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:45):**  of the truth, it's not that people are lying but they are being highly selective in the  truths that they put forward. Which essentially means that we've got to fight through the  spin and of course that's what your report is doing. So Phil you've built the report  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:05:59):**  around these eight claims that Nick just talked to us about. And you take each at face value,  break it down and then challenge the parts. And I wonder why and how you chose those eight  claims that you have chosen in particular.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:12):**  Yeah we started with an extensive literature review and identified the claims that we were  seeing most frequently. Even if we see them using slightly different words. So we looked  at mainstream media outlets, particularly the agenda setting media, as well as public  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:27):**  discussions of civil society organizations and government policy makers. And these eight  claims in particular were selected by members of our expert panel as being really influential  and deserving of further unpacking. And then we took those claims and we phrased them as  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:43):**  succinctly and as fairly as possible before we did that. We sifted through an enormous  amount of claims in this space and these are the ones that just kept keep coming up.  So in terms of the report structure, four of the claims address problems with the supply  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:06:58):**  chain, while four of them address so-called solutions. Can we start with the problems?  The first claim of which is that we need more protein to meet the needs of a growing population.  Is that not the case? And if it's not true then who's been telling us that it is?  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:12):**  We've been hearing this message for decades. Decades ago, nutritionists were telling us  that some populations needed more protein and a lot of development efforts through the  1970s and sometimes even beyond frequently focused on providing protein. Research since  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:28):**  then however, has overwhelmingly found that people who are deficient in protein are almost  always deficient in other nutrients as well. So we're not seeing a protein gap, we're seeing  a food gap. But we're also given this message by advocates of fad diets such as paleo, keto,  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:07:45):**  Atkins. But probably most importantly, this message is amplified by meat processing firm  executives who are often giving some version of the claim that protein production needs  to double by the year 2050. Even though most people in the world consume more than enough  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:03):**  protein, these executives find it in their interest to promote higher levels of consumption,  excessive amounts and they deflect attention away from the inequitable distribution of  food in general.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:13):**  So that claim about the need to double protein consumption by 2050 is very much based on  the idea that there will be a spread around the world of a Western diet and that there  will be no political attempts to arrest that or to manage that.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:28):**  I think that's fair and I think these firms are even reinforcing those trends by promoting  those types of consumption patterns.  Is there a difference between, for example, the global south versus places like the US?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:41):**  Is there a discrepancy in terms of perhaps there is a need for more protein in one place  and less protein in another, or is it just actually that there needs to be more diversity  across the board?  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:08:51):**  I would lean towards more diversity across the board because if you look at the particular  parts of the world that lack protein, they're also lacking a number of other micronutrients.  So it's pretty difficult to find a population that is only lacking in protein.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:06):**  It just coincides with a lack of access to food and diverse food sources in general.  If I could add to what Phil just said, part of the problem is that when people are making  this claim that we need to double protein production by 2050 or whichever date it's  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:20):**  given, they very often go on to propose specific solutions, whether it's alternative proteins  or ramping up meat and dairy production globally.  And the types of solutions that they have in mind are not going to be the solutions  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:33):**  that actually get more protein, more micronutrients to the people who really need them.  As Phil has mentioned, this is mostly a distributional question.  It's linked to poverty and access.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:43):**  We really need to be looking at solutions that help improve the livelihoods of farmers  in the global south and ensure that people have access to a diversity of foods.  So arguing that we need more protein on a global level isn't really helpful in that  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:09:57):**  regard and it's actually quite distracting from the real problems in the global south.  And in fact, it is quite distorting in particular around climate change and climate mitigation,  isn't it?  
**[0:10:06-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:06):**  For example, that there are really quite senior people in the world like Bill Gates and Cristiano  Figueres who invested in things like the Impossible Burger and this kind of idea that the fastest  way to reduce climate change emissions is to cut the amount of livestock and to increase  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:23):**  the amount of alternative meat.  That's certainly a narrative that's taken hold.  And I think it often comes from a good place.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:30):**  It comes from genuine concerns about the sustainability of our livestock systems.  It comes from a very real sense of urgency that I think we all have.  But kind of embedded in that approach is this sense that we need more protein, whatever  
**[0:10:43-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:43):**  the cost.  And I think that does come back to some misconceptions and it's really been internalized in the way  we think about this.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:10:50):**  And you just see many studies designed in a very narrow way just to measure how much  protein do these different products give us for how much CO2, how many greenhouse gases  without considering how that food is produced beyond greenhouse gas emissions and without  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:05):**  considering this question of access and how is this food actually going to get to the  people who need it.  You could imagine, you know, we could triple, quadruple the production of plant-based substitute  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:15):**  burgers in laboratories in the US and Europe.  But are those really going to be at an affordable price for poor consumers in Africa?  And I think, you know, what we worry about here is that what's more likely than them  
**[0:11:26-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:26):**  having access to that food is actually that there would be negative knock-on effects on  livestock farming in the global south, which is often a lifeline for poorer communities.  So the message that we need less livestock, but more protein is not really in sync with  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:39):**  the realities of countries in the global south, the realities of food security there.  I'm going to stick on this idea of power, Nick, and this idea that narratives are being  successfully fueled by large, powerful individuals or corporations links, to me, it seems to  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:11:53):**  claim seven, which is a solution that technological advances can rapidly reduce the negative impacts  of livestock.  Now, much as new technology can offer super helpful things to do in all systems, this  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:06):**  claim has always seemed to me to be a justification for the most intensive livestock producers  to carry on with business as usual.  What does the report find and does this claim stack up?  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:16):**  So first of all, just to explain a bit what we're talking about here, when we talk about  these techno fixes that are being put forward, we're talking about things like methane digesters,  livestock vaccines, new breeding approaches, when animals are being bred to be more tolerant  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:31):**  of specific conditions, whether that's heat or confinement, and systems based on kind  of generating real time data, even pig facial recognition technologies are being put out  there.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:43):**  Lots of digital solutions generally packaged together as kind of precision livestock.  Once again, this claim is neither true nor false.  But we've dug down into this and really looked at these solutions and asked, what are these  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:12:57):**  solutions to and for whom and for how long will they actually be solutions?  And you know, a first kind of key thing to note here is that these technology led solutions  overwhelmingly designed for bigger, very highly capitalized farms, and arguably only really  
**[0:13:12-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:12):**  viable for those farms.  So if you take the case of these anaerobic digesters to capture methane, it's a big plank  of the kind of response to, you know, livestock emissions in the US being rolled out, subsidized  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:25):**  in California, and I think, soon across the US.  But the cost of these things is something like, you know, three to $5 million.  This is just not going to be viable for smaller units, even with subsidies, and you need to  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:35):**  be producing at a huge scale to really then capture those benefits.  So again, it's not to say that this has no value, but to be clear that this is a specific  solution for a specific type of farm, and it's likely to be reinforcing that pressure  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:13:47):**  to farm at a large scale, something we would argue is really the root of many other problems.  There's also the problem that a number of these technological solutions are actually about increasing the density  and the genetic uniformity of livestock units, and they offer new tools for maybe monitoring  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:04):**  the risks that come with that.  For us, that's really not a solution that's going to work in the longer term.  It's just kicking the can down the road.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:10):**  Those are the conditions that allow diseases to proliferate and create the big waste flows  that are such a problem.  Mason, thanks very much for that.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:17):**  I'm going to push back slightly because there is a danger of sounding anti-technology when  we're talking about these sorts of issues.  There are many technologies that can be helpful for really small scale producers as well.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:29):**  There are things like selective breeding, which have been around for as long as agriculture  has existed.  Even things like facial recognition, there can be some real benefits.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:39):**  I've seen facial recognition systems working on sheep.  They're able to recognise a pre-manifestation of a health problem that a farmer might not  notice themselves for a few more days, and that can make the difference between a foot  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:14:51):**  disease running rampant through a flock or being captured and caught and treated at a  very early stage before it's moved even from a single animal.  I agree, Finlow, and I think there are many positive examples of technologies being integrated  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:06):**  at appropriate scales.  And our view is certainly not that all of these should be avoided.  I think one thing we're concerned about is that technological innovations are constantly  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:14):**  elevated ahead of social innovations and are constantly used, I think, to avoid the more  profound discussion that's needed about how to redesign systems, how to get away from  this uniformity that creates so many problems in the first place.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:27):**  So there clearly is a kind of a path dependency problem here where farms take on so many of  these technologies that they're really obliged to farm at a certain scale in a certain way  that doesn't allow some of the bigger changes and the kind of redesign, reintegration of  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:41):**  crops and livestock, for example, that could lead to many efficiencies.  Another issue we raise here is that these technologies are so hyped that we often just  focus on the positives and don't pay enough attention to the risks.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:15:53):**  And in some cases, those risks are manageable.  And in some cases, they're not.  And they don't accrue quickly enough for us to really see the problems.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:00):**  And if you take breeding approaches, I think this is a good example where we have this  constant pressure towards new breeding approaches to increase productivity.  But it's pushing in a direction that just can't be sustained.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:10):**  And you know, the push, for example, to have laying hens that produce larger eggs over  a longer time period, we see that that leads to, you know, recurrent keelbone fractures,  and it's neither humane, nor is it productive in the long term.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:22):**  There's also the example of the double muscled Belgian blue beef, that's a cattle breed that,  you know, has been touted for its ability to improve the muscle structure, deliver high  yields, but over time, it's clear that this leads to a higher risk of genetic disorders,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:36):**  higher mortality of animals.  So if you look at, you know, the whole picture, I think a lot of these technologies over time  do not deliver the benefits they're supposed to.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:45):**  What we're arguing, first of all, we're arguing here just for more scrutiny of these technologies  and to really have a sense of how they're going to support the transition farmers need  to make.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:16:55):**  I think that's really interesting.  I like the way again, that you framed that because it's about looking to see whether  these, for example, the genetics improvements, the breeding improvements are going to benefit  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:04):**  the animal or adjust there to kind of force the animal ever more into a system that the  animal should never have existed in the first place.  Phil, one of the areas that's particularly interesting is the claim around alternative  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:18):**  proteins or alt meats as a solution.  And you framed the claim as alternative proteins are a win, win, win for animals, people and  the planet.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:27):**  Now, as we've already discussed, we know that there is a need to shift to more sustainable  food systems and that this means a transition from a cheap oversupply of industrially produced  food to extensive and land appropriate food production.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:40):**  So in terms of delivering that narrative, are there any ways that you think that alternative  proteins can work as a transitional bridge away from excessive, excessive meat and dairy  consumption?  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:17:52):**  Yeah, that's the message we hear frequently that it's a win, win, win.  And there, there is an element that these can be helpful, but the ones that are receiving  the most hype are the ones that are most processed and have ultra processed ingredients.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:07):**  And this claim rests on some shaky foundations already.  We've already talked about the idea that people need to consume a lot more protein and they  don't.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:15):**  Another is that dietary habits are quite resistant to change and that a substitute with nearly  identical taste is needed.  But what this does in fact is reinforce a center of the plate diet that emphasizes either  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:28):**  meat or a highly processed substitute.  And it does steer people away from more diverse and less processed diets often without even  actually reducing meat and dairy consumption.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:38):**  And these firms are quite capable of driving rapid shifts in diets.  So there was the innovation of fish sticks, for example, which was promoted as a way to  deal with the surplus of large blocks of frozen fish.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:18:50):**  And now it's a very common element in many people's diets.  But unfortunately, diverse and less processed diets are not as profitable and therefore  they receive far, far less investment.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:00):**  And it's really clear as well from your work because, you know, your specialism is visualization  and the visualizations in this report are really helpful, really good stuff.  And you can see the amount of money that is being put in by companies that currently specialize  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:15):**  in livestock and livestock processing like Tyson Foods that are now putting so much money  into these alternative proteins, which suggests that it's not about trying to help a transition  to a more climate and environmentally friendly way of eating.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:31):**  It's just about maintaining profits.  Yeah, and they're doing a nice job of covering their bases and make sure they have hands  in all of those alternatives that are being pushed by other people as alternatives to  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:43):**  the products that they first specialized in.  One of the things that makes us very skeptical about the sustainability credentials of these  alternative proteins is the fact that, you know, these same companies coming from the  
**[0:19:55-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:19:55):**  meat and dairy sectors are moving into this sector.  Replacing meat with plant-based ingredients is not the solution in of itself.  It all depends on how those ingredients are produced.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:04):**  And what we're concerned about here is that the kind of the many ingredients, plant-based  ingredients that will be going into these substitute products are actually going to  be sourced from the same kind of chemical intensive monoculture systems that we see  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:16):**  today, including for the production of feed for livestock.  A lot of the comparisons are more nuanced and some of the claims are not nuanced and  we'll say this is going to be a win-win-win.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:26):**  But when you look at some of the studies done, the sustainability benefits of these alternative  products really depends on what ingredients are used.  And you know, one study found that substitutes that are based on soy and wheat don't offer  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:37):**  the same benefits as ones that are based on something like lupin.  And then, you know, a lot of these substitutes use coconut and palm oil as key ingredients.  And these are commodities that are associated with deforestation, generally farmed in an  
**[0:20:49-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:49):**  unsustainable way.  So just shifting from meat to non-meat inputs is not a guarantee of sustainability in of  itself.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:20:56):**  But from a pure company perspective, it's not necessarily an unreasonable thing to do  if you feel like your business is being pilloried from a range of different quarters because  you're producing too much livestock to start supplying something else.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:09):**  But I guess the message is the same in both directions.  Whether you're continuing to produce livestock or producing these alt-meat products, the  source material, the animal or the ingredients that are going into that alt-meat product  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:22):**  need to be from sustainable sources because otherwise all you're doing is simply displacing  one problem by creating another.  That's right.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:30):**  And I think, you know, first and foremost, we wanted people to know that this is happening  because when you're buying an alternative meat product, it's not clear these are the  same companies.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:39):**  And I think people might have the perception that they're buying something, you know, produced  by startups or small businesses with very different supply chains.  And that's certainly not the case.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:48):**  I think it's worth saying as well that the jury's still out.  It's possible that these companies are not just diversifying, but they're really trying  to shift their business model.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:21:55):**  We just haven't seen much evidence to suggest that's the case.  And I think, you know, there's a lot of evidence already before the alt-meat boom of these  big companies with problematic reputations trying to kind of change their image by buying  
**[0:22:09-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:09):**  up sustainable brands, organic brands.  So if you take JBS, the biggest meat company in the world, often pilloried for its practices,  that's a company that owns, you know, 100 plus brands, including grass fed meat product  
**[0:22:22-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:22):**  lines.  And, you know, the question is, is that, are they really investing in those things or are  they trying to cover their bases and sort of greenwash their image?  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:29):**  Jason Vale, The Guardian, Let's stay on that just for a moment, because  when money is controlled and power is contained by a relatively small number of people, I  wonder, is it even possible to deliver the integrated model of land use that's an essential  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:41):**  part of an agroecological approach to global food systems?  Does that boardroom pressure always mean that there is going to be specialization that leads  to an unsustainable approach?  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:22:52):**  I think it's very difficult to imagine a kind of agroecological transformation with power  relations remaining as they currently are.  I certainly don't think the impetus is going to come from the private sector and from those  
**[0:23:05-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:05):**  big companies.  When it does start to become possible and viable is when you think about shifting the  policy incentives.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:12):**  And that's really what's at play here.  And there's so much lobbying right now about the future of these agricultural policies  and which types of models are going to be supported.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:21):**  And if you could imagine a big shift in agricultural subsidies, in agri-development funding, supporting  credit for smallholders, allowing people to access land in different ways, coupled with  changes in the procurement practices of big retailers, then I think it does start to become  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:37):**  viable, because really all of those things need to change.  And the current incentives are really stacked up in favor of producing specific commodities  at a large scale.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:47):**  And where are we?  Because obviously you're in the EU, you're based in Brussels.  And where are we now with Farm to Fork?  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:23:52):**  What's happening there?  We're at a very perilous moment where the Farm to Fork strategy, which is still really  in its infancy, has just been adopted by the European Parliament, giving this new direction  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:04):**  for European agriculture, is being attacked and is being diluted thanks to very effective  agribusiness lobbying.  In the face of the crisis coming out of Ukraine, the reality of global food prices increasing,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:17):**  we've seen some very vocal lobbying for this potentially transformative EU strategy to  be suspended on the grounds that farmers in Europe just need to produce more to feed the  world.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:29):**  That's a message that I think has plenty of holes in it, but it's been effective at this  moment and has responded to the kind of very real concerns around food price inflation  and what impact that's going to have on food security in Europe, in the Middle East, in  
**[0:24:42-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:42):**  many other regions.  I want to move on to Claim 6, which hones in on fishing and aquaculture, again controlled  by enormous financial interests.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:24:52):**  There's a story being told that with wild fish capture stagnating, aquaculture production  should be increasing.  And yet the negative environmental and welfare impacts of large scale aquaculture, such as  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:02):**  salmon farming, are immense, while the positive impacts of smaller multi-trophic systems where  shellfish are integrated with kelp are yet to be scaled and require significant dietary  change from citizens as well.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:15):**  What are the main issues that you've come across in researching this report?  First of all, we found that there are huge generalisations in this area.  And already when looking at livestock, we've sounded the alarm on the fact that livestock  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:27):**  is being treated as a single entity when you have this huge spectrum of impacts from industrial  through to small scale pastoralist forms of livestock.  And with aquaculture, that's arguably even greater, where you have these centuries old  
**[0:25:41-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:41):**  practices, multi-trophic level aquaculture, many integrated systems that are delivering  high quality food, healthy, nutritious food for populations who don't have access to many  other sources of protein, micronutrients.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:25:56):**  You also have extremely intensive single species systems focused on salmon, trout, other high  value fish, which have huge requirements in terms of feed, and that's very often fish  feed.  
**[0:26:10-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:10):**  Sometimes it's crop based as well.  So we hear that we need to shift from meat to farmed fish to reduce the pressures on  the land, but actually about 4% of global crops are fed to fish.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:21):**  So the impacts shift back onto the land there as well.  So again, it really just depends on what models we're talking about.  And we found these big generic claims about the need to scale up aquaculture.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:32):**  And clearly it's true that we do need to look to aquaculture as a potential solution.  Fish does provide a lot of the protein intake for people around the world, but it all depends  on what type of aquaculture and what problems we're trying to solve.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:45):**  If our rationale is to take the pressure off wild fisheries, then it's really a problem  to be investing in this large scale single species, very intensive aquaculture, because  that is undermining wild fish populations through the pollution contamination you mentioned,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:26:59):**  Finlow, through the pressures on other species of fish that are required to feed those animals,  through the spread of diseases from fish escapes and the contamination that we discussed.  In some of the cases we looked at, up to 90% of the fish that's being used as feed could  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:15):**  be used directly for human consumption.  So if the underlying rationale here is food security, and we're saying we need to invest  in aquaculture to boost food security in the face of stagnating wild fish stocks, the best  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:29):**  way to undermine food security is to take food out of the hands of communities that  need it.  And fishing those smaller species and shipping them across the world for farmed fish is surely  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:39):**  not an efficient use of resources and not a solution for food security in the longer  term.  Phil, when I was reading the report, I was struck by two claims that seemed to me to  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:27:47):**  be immediately diametrically opposed.  For example, if claim three that livestock production is incompatible with climate and  sustainability goals were true, then claim eight that regen livestock systems can solve  
**[0:28:02-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:02):**  environmental problems like climate change and soil degradation must not be true.  What did you discover about these claims?  Yeah, these claims are made by different interest groups, so it's not surprising that they are  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:13):**  conflicting messages, but both are oversimplifications.  So the claim that livestock production is incompatible with climate sustainability goals  is focused quite narrowly on greenhouse gas emissions or even just carbon or methane,  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:27):**  and it ignores enormous variation in production systems such as measuring only the impacts  of industrial livestock operations.  And the claim that regenerative approaches, which are very different, can solve all these  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:39):**  problems also focus on narrow measures such as carbon sequestration or increasing soil  organic matter, and on the basis of a very limited amount of evidence to date.  So, that brings us on to an issue that I'd like to go into in a bit more detail, because  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:28:53):**  as I said, I think in general the report is excellent, but I do have one or two concerns,  and one of them is around the fact that I think you're a bit too hard on regen agriculture.  So let's talk about that.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:05):**  Regen is largely a movement of smaller producers who are working really hard to understand  the land, to manage the land, and to look after natural resources as well as they possibly can.  So when regenerative land management is a tool that can help deliver the agroecological  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:21):**  food systems that we all agree are so important, what is it about the regen movement that concerns  you?  Because it seems to me that regen isn't part of the same sort of power and money challenge  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:34):**  that we've been talking about for so much of the rest of this programme.  Yeah, but it's quickly getting there, because this movement's ideas have been significantly  amplified by giant corporations like McDonald's, Arla, and General Mills.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:29:48):**  And I am sympathetic to many aspects of regenerative agriculture, but also concerned about the  exaggeration of benefits, the minimising of complexities, uncertainties, and context,  and particularly the lack of attention to social aspects of sustainability, such as  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:04):**  ethnic disparities and land ownership patterns, for example.  And the idea of a simple management fix can be just as alluring as a techno fix, but as  Nick was saying earlier, it's a way of avoiding tough but needed conversations about the distribution  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:18):**  of power.  So if we take one of those brands that you mentioned, Arla, for example, part of the  work that we're doing on regenerative dairy, and they're quite upfront about the fact that  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:28):**  regenerative agriculture is an ambition for them, which is why they're working with other  dairy companies and with groups like ourselves and FAI, in order to try and understand and  envision what regenerative dairy is and what it should look like, and then to develop pathways  
**[0:30:45-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:45):**  to get there.  And it seems to me that if Arla can manage to deliver that throughout its supply chain  with all of the farmers that are part of that brand, surely that would be a fantastic thing.  
**[0:30:56-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:30:56):**  Yeah, yeah.  It's just that the evidence so far hasn't caught up with that kind of claim.  So for example, one of the questions that hasn't really been answered with the short-term  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:07):**  studies to date is how the benefits of soil sequestration will be made over time as peak  soil organic carbon levels are reached.  When degraded land soils are restored with generative practices, there are some benefits,  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:20):**  but there's a debate over how long, whether or not soils will retain carbon if there's  not also sufficient nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur, and concerns that these minerals  may be better used to grow food than stored in soils.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:34):**  So that example that you've picked on is one of those where I feel like there is to a degree  an overstatement and the report says that reliable ways of measuring soil carbon sequestration  is still lacking, but I'm not sure that that's fair because there are a range of reliable  
**[0:31:48-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:48):**  ways of measuring soil carbon.  So surely the problem isn't so much about reliability and more about consistency and  transparency in terms of the methodology.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:31:57):**  Yeah, definitely.  That's what we would all like to see is more consistency, more transparency.  So by raising attention to this issue, hopefully, you know, that will bring some pressure to  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:09):**  move closer to that goal.  One of the things that always concerns me when we're talking about soil carbon sequestration  is that, I mean, obviously, you know, to an extent, the measuring of soil carbon is in  
**[0:32:19-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:19):**  a relative infancy in comparison with sequestering it in wood.  But at the same time, there are similar challenges with wood when it comes to maintaining that  that sequestered asset over time because wood is vulnerable, particularly to things like  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:33):**  fires and drought where, you know, soils can die.  And so we have these problems if we're talking about anything where we're trying to sequester  carbon.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:42):**  I mean, ultimately, we need to stop burning fossil fuels.  I mean, that's, that's how we deal with these things.  But in terms of a basic way of drawing carbon out of the air, which isn't super expensive,  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:32:52):**  doesn't require huge amounts of technology, both trees and soil surely are really good  things in that narrative.  Absolutely.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:00):**  But there's a risk of overemphasizing and overpromising here.  And when we do that, we take our eye off the ball.  And I think there's a risk that other sectors that are truly extractive sectors get a free  
**[0:33:11-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:11):**  lunch and there's less scrutiny of what they're doing.  You know, for so long as people can believe that there's some kind of silver bullet solution,  whether it's a technology or whether it's the capacity of the soil to absorb infinite  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:23):**  carbon, there's a risk that we just carry on with business as usual.  And I think that temptation is huge all the time to find solutions that allow us to carry  on more or less as we are now.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:32):**  So with Regenerative, it's just a question of finding that right balance and being clear  on the big potential, but also calling out the exaggerations when we hear them.  And I think, you know, in this report, we've really been bounded by what the big players  
**[0:33:45-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:45):**  are saying.  And clearly, you know, we have big companies who are making big, bold promises on this  and then acknowledging kind of in the small print of their annual reports that they don't  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:33:53):**  really have the metrics to assess whether suppliers are doing it yet.  That's fine.  And it's good that they're acknowledging those things.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:00):**  But I think there's a disconnect there and it's possibly on purpose.  And there's a big danger if we're all somehow led to believe that Big Ag and the food industry  has this under control, that they were emitting a lot, but they've got this great, you know,  
**[0:34:14-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:14):**  set of regenerative solutions and they're on top of it and we can all relax and continue  buying our products.  And our concern always is that there's this bigger transformation that's needed on every  
**[0:34:24-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:24):**  level.  It's this redesign of the production system, the redesign of supply chains as well, and  people reconnecting with their food and asking these questions.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:32):**  And that's where that skepticism comes from.  And when we see a term like regenerative being plastered all over products and, you know,  the names of conferences, we worry that the underlying goal is to make people take their  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:47):**  foot off the pedal and to distract from that broader transformation and to imply once again  that the industry is the driver of change, despite the fact that those metrics are not  quite there yet.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:34:58):**  And often the real innovators are coming from the bottom up rather than the top down.  Indeed, indeed.  And you know, we see certainly with alternative proteins as well, the same parallel where  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:08):**  there's a lot of innovation at the ground level, startups doing really interesting things  and they're gradually bought up and then the types of innovation change.  And there's a kind of standardized approach that sets in and probably more investment  
**[0:35:21-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:21):**  then shifting to promoting what's being done rather than actually trying to make it work  on the ground.  Nick, I'm pushing back a little bit because I just want to sort of test some of these  
**[0:35:30-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:30):**  claims, but at the same time, I completely agree with you that it's really important  to make sure that if claims are being made, that they do stack up.  And clearly there is a danger that if regenerative agriculture does overclaim, then it's just  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:44):**  going to be branded as greenwash.  And then, you know, nobody really benefits because the public don't understand, you know,  what it is that they're getting.  
**[0:35:52-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:35:52):**  And you know, at this point in society's development, in human development, it's so important that  if people are doing good, then it gets scaled in a good way so that we can trust whatever  it is that's coming as a result.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:05):**  Now, Nick, I wonder about the politics at this point of talking about the politics of  protein and what decisions you've taken as an expert group, because clearly I-PEST food  isn't independent.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:16):**  You're very clearly in favor of agroecology.  So how have you approached this project?  First of all, we really tried to take the claims at face value and to, you know, say  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:26):**  what is being claimed and what evidence is there in support of those arguments.  So we're not, you know, holding people up against an impossible standard and saying,  is this agroecological?  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:35):**  We're saying, you know, you're claiming that alternative proteins are going to save the  planet, etc.  What evidence is there of that?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:42):**  Clearly, we do have a well documented worldview in the i-PEST food panel.  We believe that in the medium to longer term, an agroecological transformation is needed.  And you know, that does guide the types of questions we ask.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:36:55):**  So when we look at solutions like alternative proteins or techno fixes for livestock, we're  coming at that with a view that in the medium term or even sooner, power does need to be  decentralized in food systems.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:07):**  We're coming with a view that the corporations that currently hold power in food systems  can't really be trusted to steer us in a very different direction.  It's not really in their DNA.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:16):**  We're coming with a view that change needs to happen very fast, but also that it needs  to be holistic through the food system, not just focused on one factor like greenhouse  gas emissions.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:26):**  I think one way we address that as well was to ensure that we included claims that are  being made not just by big industry, but also by civil society groups and by health professionals  and by other people with whom we've broadly been in agreement in the past and would share  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:42):**  many of their concerns.  And you know, we very robustly assess the claim in this report that red meat is bad  for your health.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:37:49):**  And that's a claim made, I think, in good faith by lots of actors who are concerned  about the health impacts of what we eat.  But there we were also willing to say, well, you know, the evidence in this area is very  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:01):**  complicated.  As I say, I think it's a really helpful report in so many ways.  The way that each of those claims has been deconstructed and visualized is really a really  
**[0:38:11-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:11):**  helpful contribution.  Just the final challenge really for me is that this report is clearly, it's a review  of existing claims and a review of existing academic papers, information that's already  
**[0:38:24-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:24):**  in the public domain.  Now, something we've discussed on the podcast previously with IPES food experts like Jennifer  Clapp and Molly Anderson is the need to establish a better capacity to value experience and  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:36):**  practice at ground level alongside academic peer reviewed papers.  And I wonder, Nick, if there is a danger that the report's approach to, for example, regen  agriculture, it's too embedded in academia when actually most of the knowledge of regen  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:51):**  is still out in the field.  Yeah, that is a challenge.  Indeed, in a paper like this, we were trying to be very comprehensive in reviewing the  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:38:59):**  evidence that's out there right now.  We do always consider different types of evidence and we include, you know, so-called grey literature,  papers by NGOs, social movements alongside academic literature.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:10):**  But I think indeed with regen, there's so much experimentation happening and I think  it's so crucial for that to be able to happen.  And you know, that's probably, I think, one of our concerns when we talk about the  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:21):**  co-option of regenerative livestock, regenerative agriculture and the food industry being the  main mouthpiece for this at the moment.  There needs to be this kind of farmer led experimentation on the ground with all different  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:33):**  ways of redesigning production systems, making them sustainable.  Our concern is that an industry led version of regenerative agriculture might just become  another checklist, another set of things farmers need to do that don't really unleash their  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:39:47):**  potential to experiment and to work off of the research they're seeing.  So, that's definitely a concern that we share.  Phil, just coming back to you, having addressed these claims in the way that you have throughout  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:00):**  the report, the report comes to three clear conclusions.  And I wonder if you could just summarise these for us and then talk us through each one in  a little bit more detail.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:09):**  Yeah, our three recommendations are to first shift the focus away from a protein transition  to a holistic food system transitions and sustainable food policies.  Second to prioritise territorial approaches to food system changes.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:25):**  And then the third recommendation is about the claims themselves to reclaim the debate  from dominant meat and dairy processors and to have broader conversations, ones that involve  communities that currently have very little voice in the debates.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:38):**  So in other words, you know, Bill Gates has no problem getting out the message that he  thinks people in rich countries should eat synthetic beef, which happens to come from  firms that he has huge investments in.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:40:50):**  But we don't typically hear from small scale livestock or aquaculture producers in less  affluent nations in particular.  And if we did, there probably wouldn't be such an emphasis on this single macronutrient  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:01):**  of protein.  We would hear much more of an emphasis on food or even the broader cultural significance  of the animals that contribute to human diets.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:09):**  And we would also likely hear about the territorial differences that make global policy prescriptions  really problematic when applied to smaller producers and to more direct supply chains,  particularly in the global south.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:21):**  Thanks so much for that, Phil.  Now, Nick, how is it that the report's going to be used?  How do you think it's likely to be used by citizens and policymakers?  
**[0:41:29-0:41:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:29):**  Yeah, I think this report is quite different to some of our other reports in that regard.  We typically had some quite specific policy reforms in mind and put that forward.  And in this case, Phil has discussed the recommendations we have.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:44):**  They're broad recommendations about reframing the debate.  That's not to say that we are disinterested in the policy debates going on right now.  And we start the report by saying, as we speak, there's significant lobbying going on to get  
**[0:41:59-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:41:59):**  public support behind alternative proteins, whether it's research and development funding  for lab-grown meat or promotional funds for fake meats.  And that's really a huge stake right now with governments from the US to China to Denmark,  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:15):**  Germany readying quite significant investments in alternative proteins.  So we're very clear in the report that we don't see a justification for public funding  to go into these products at this stage.  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:27):**  We don't see enough evidence of their potential to really transform food systems.  We don't see enough evidence to justify this being considered in the public good per se.  But here, yeah, the goals of the report are broader, you know, beyond influencing those  
**[0:42:41-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:41):**  policy decisions.  And first and foremost, we hope that the report will be a starting point for dialogue and  for kind of resetting the debate on these topics because they're just too polarized  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:42:51):**  right now.  And you have livestock farmers on one hand, animal welfare activists on the other who  really aren't able to engage with each other on this topic.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:00):**  Commercial groups, nutritional groups, people with different interests who don't see enough  of the things they have in common on this topic.  And you know, people rightly, I think, are unwilling to engage in debate if they think  
**[0:43:12-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:12):**  that the outcome is already decided.  So what we're hoping with this report, we're hoping that most groups can look at this and  say, well, this is a fair, quite a fair assessment of different perspectives.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:22):**  I see that my worldview is at least taken into account here.  Yeah, we're hoping to reset the debate in that way and help to overcome polarization.  That's all we've got time for.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-politics-of-protein-e1grpd3#t=0:43:31):**  It's been really interesting talking to you.  So I'd like to thank my guests, Nick Jacobs and Phil Howard for my pest food.  If you've enjoyed listening, please come back and listen to more.

### Farm Gate  (2022-05-04)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn LoKastain, the chief executive of Farmwell and founder  of the Food and Global Security Network.  The American radio broadcaster Paul Harvey summarised the fragility of human existence  
**[0:00:17-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:00:17):**  in just a few words. He said,  Man, despite his artistic pretensions, his sophistication and his many accomplishments,  owes his existence to a six-inch layer of topsoil and the fact that it rains.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:00:30):**  In this programme we're discussing a feature film, Six Inches of Soil, which is named after  this quote and currently in pre-production in the UK.  The film is being crowdfunded by organisations and individuals who take the words of Paul  
**[0:00:42-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:00:42):**  Harvey as a call to action to ensure that even as we're driven towards an ecological  precipice fuelled in part by an industrialised food system, we recognise that the dirt beneath  our feet is what feeds us and makes our society strong.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:00:56):**  When soil fails, societies become intensely vulnerable to conflict and exploitation. Not  only are global soils the essential source of our nutrition, but their regeneration is  critical in tackling the ecological crisis and for ensuring peace and global security.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:01:11):**  I'm joined by Colin Ramsay, the director of Six Inches of Soil, and by Claire Mackenzie,  the film's producer. Welcome both.  Hello.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:01:19):**  Hi.  Six Inches of Soil will follow in a long tradition of environmental films that aim to change  the way that people think. Why is it, do you think, that feature-length documentaries are  
**[0:01:29-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:01:29):**  so important and so influential?  I think there's a lot of fatigue out there with environmental messaging from governments  and from the media for people. And increasingly people don't want to read long reports either.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:01:40):**  They don't have the time or the capacity to read those. And even, you know, I even hear  that from academics as well. And so what you get with a movie is a condensed story of a  particular environmental issue. And the filmmakers have done a good job trying to compact and  
**[0:01:53-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:01:53):**  distill down all the core issues which they want to discuss. And there'll be a human element  to a good environmental documentary as well. And it just gives you access into a world  and helps you connect with some of the messages without being bored, without being overwhelmed,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:02:08):**  without feeling too depressed. And I think a lot more environmental documentaries now  moving into the impact space as well. So they're not just a film in and of itself. They're  part of a campaign and an impact to change behaviour, to change policy, to change decision-makers.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:02:22):**  So I think good environmental documentaries do both. They tell a great story with, you  know, interesting human characters, either globally or locally, and they combine that  with a policy change piece or an education piece. And we've seen that more recently with  
**[0:02:34-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:02:34):**  things like Kiss the Ground and Seaspiracy. There were some campaigns off the back of  those workshops, education pieces that come around schools. But ultimately, you know,  good films come back to good storytelling and that hasn't changed. That's still really  
**[0:02:46-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:02:46):**  important. You just can't keep giving people information and expect them to change. They  need to feel something as well. And I think it's that combination of head and heart. If  you can make that land, it's really powerful, really potent for people.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:02:58):**  Why is it that a feature length documentary still has an impact that a series might not?  I think it's a bit of escapism. The 90 minute format, the 90 minute formula of, you know,  you sit down in the cinema, you watch a film for 90 minutes, two hours, you can be taken  
**[0:03:11-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:03:11):**  away into a different world. It's dark and you can really let those stories and those  issues permeate your mind and body and feel something. If it's episodic, you either kind  of binge on it and it's just too much, or you don't get enough. You don't really escape  
**[0:03:24-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:03:24):**  into that world for deep, you know, deep and long enough. That's my opinion anyway. And  I think the feature length format kind of bookends the story as well. So it forces the  filmmakers to give the audience something that's quite compact and compelling. And you  
**[0:03:37-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:03:37):**  can digest in one sitting and go away and talk about it over a drink with friends.  Now this film is about soil and agriculture. Why is this story in particular so important  to you? You're clearly investing a lot of time in making this. Why is it so important?  
**[0:03:51-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:03:51):**  There's a couple of threads here. The first thread is me personally. I haven't had the  opportunity as a filmmaker to work on something environmental for a long time and especially  in our own backyard. So having that feeling of apathy and not being able to use my talent  
**[0:04:04-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:04:04):**  as skills kind of drove that as well. So I was, you know, searching and asking the universe  for something like this to come along, which is fantastic. And then in 2020, I met Claire  and she was working at Cambridge Carbon Neutral. We also had a commission from Cambridgeshire  
**[0:04:17-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:04:17):**  County Council to make a short film. So we came together as two people that care about  the environment to make a short film that followed the journey of five regenerative  farmers in Cambridgeshire. And it's from making that short film called From the Ground Up  
**[0:04:27-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:04:27):**  that was sort of the genesis of this film. So we had a local story about regenerative  agriculture in Cambridgeshire where we're both from. And that kind of grew the seeds  for this film because there's, I realised and we both realised that there's a bigger  
**[0:04:39-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:04:39):**  story to tell here. There's a national story that hadn't been told before from a UK perspective  about our soils, about agroecology, about food and farming and connecting all those  bits together. And this is why we've spent a year in pre-production because there's a  
**[0:04:54-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:04:54):**  lot to tackle, as you know, in food and farmers, a lot of research required, there's a lot  of relationship building, partnership building. So our challenge is to compress all that down  into a feature film.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:05:04):**  For me, I'm a master passion environmentalist, always liberally connected to food and farming  through family and have always grown my own veg, etc. And I have a family. So for me,  it's usually important, I'm always looking to the future as well. But I'm a practical  
**[0:05:21-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:05:21):**  person, I want to do something. So for me, I'm part of Carbon Neutral Cambridge, it's  a voluntary organisation in Cambridge. I was invited to have my own project actually, and  it was in lockdown. And they said, what are you really passionate about? What do you want  
**[0:05:35-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:05:35):**  to cover? And we'd moved to Cambridge, we moved about eight years ago. And I've never  lived on arable land. And I was looking at what is going on, you know, I want to understand  it more. But I was also reading books about wilding, books about regenerative farming.  
**[0:05:52-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:05:52):**  And I just wanted to know if some of that was going on our doorstep. A lot of our farmers  around here are absent landlords, so I can't go to them and say what's going on. But one  farmer up the road is doing so much. And my neighbours said I love living on his land  
**[0:06:08-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:06:08):**  because he tells us he's spraying less, he tells us he's trying to regenerate his soil.  And I was like, well, there is something there. So that's when I started exploring it. And  I got Colin to produce into a film because it was COVID, we couldn't get people in a  
**[0:06:21-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:06:21):**  room, we couldn't have that talking shop with farmers and people listening. So we got funding  from the local council, as Colin has said, and a local environmental climate change group.  But from there afterwards, it was so well received, not just by farmers, but by environmentalists.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:06:36):**  But on this webinar, when we presented this short film, it was so well received, Colin  basically turned to me and said, right, I feel, having seen Kiss the Ground, we need  to tell a wider story. And every time I speak to another farmer, at any stage of their journey,  
**[0:06:50-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:06:50):**  or even if they're just looking over their heads and thinking about what to do and how  they're going to face climate change, I just think it's compelling and amazing. And I think  we hear a lot from chefs. And we are hearing more, thank goodness, from farmers. But I  
**[0:07:04-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:07:04):**  think we need to, you know, the audience and the people around Food and Farm understand  it further.  Now, you both mentioned Kiss the Ground, which clearly has been this hugely influential film  
**[0:07:15-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:07:15):**  that was based in the US. So the question, Claire, is why Britain? Why make the film  here? And how is it going to differ from Kiss the Ground? Are you simply remaking it in  Britain or is it a different proposition entirely?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:07:28):**  Obviously, in every country in the world, or even every county in every town, you know,  farming differs. We have different traditions, we have different policy issues at the moment  with Brexit. And now we're dealing with the awfulness of Ukraine. But in Britain, it's  
**[0:07:43-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:07:43):**  different. We have different topography, different weather, we're an island. And a lot of these  films come out of America. And there's a lot of pieces, a lot of short pieces, like  Carbon Cowboys, etc. And a lot of writings, obviously, because the regenerative movement  
**[0:07:57-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:07:57):**  has been very strong, Gay Brown, etc. So in the US and Australia, and actually in South  America, that because they have been faced with dust bowls, etc. But we're now seeing  it here. And so the farmers here are doing it differently, because we have different  
**[0:08:14-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:08:14):**  land and different soil types and different weather. And then obviously, all of the complicatedness  on top of that of our politics, and our traditions and our land.  Exactly. So all of those huge issues. And so that then leads to land being pressurised  
**[0:08:32-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:08:32):**  to be sold for, especially when we live in Cambridgeshire for housing, particularly.  The history in British countryside is phenomenal. And there are indigenous farmers, and you  can get to the older farmers, which we're trying to do to show some of the modern techniques  
**[0:08:46-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:08:46):**  being used in regenerative agroecology. If you look back, so the Second World War, pre-Second  World War, to have those conversations with people who've been on that farm to hear from  those who are connected.  
**[0:08:56-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:08:56):**  There's also a policy conflict, which I thought a couple of years ago had kind of been put  to bed, but it's re-emerged, which is this continuing conflict between those who promote  land sparing, where you shove agriculture into one space, forestry perhaps, and rewilding  
**[0:09:12-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:09:12):**  into other spaces. And those who support land sharing, where you have land working together  to deliver those multiple outcomes. Will the film be presenting these different land use  perspectives equally, or will you be taking a clear position, do you think?  
**[0:09:25-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:09:25):**  We have the sparing versus sharing debate in our narrative treatment, and we do want  to tackle it. Most of the public have no idea what that even means. So, you know, first  let's debunk some of the myths and work out what is actually we're actually talking about.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:09:38):**  And is this part of government policy or not? Because the government doesn't seem to be  leading on any of this really. And this is part of the story as well. This is a secondary  level of stories that farmers are just getting on with it. You know, regenerative farms,  
**[0:09:50-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:09:50):**  agricultural farms are just getting on with making the change themselves, not waiting  to be told to make the change. So that's part of it as well. I personally think you can't  separate the two out. I don't see why everything's so interconnected. You can't just put intensive  
**[0:10:03-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:10:03):**  farming into a pocket of like East Anglia, say, and then rewild the rest of Britain,  expect that all to go fine. Because what happens to all the biodiversity on that farm? How  the soil is connected? How is the water connected? Where's the wildlife corridors? There's all  
**[0:10:16-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:10:16):**  these interconnected issues. I think politicians want simple answers. They want a really nice  neat little package. They want to stand in front of the power generator or the forestry  and just say, we did this, we planted this, that's nature over there. Job done. And I  
**[0:10:29-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:10:29):**  think it's just not that simple. They don't like complexity. They don't like diversity.  It's interesting to hear that approach that you talk about there, which is land sharing,  that multi outcome land use, and then comparing that with the way in which government wants  
**[0:10:42-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:10:42):**  easy answers. And I think one of the people that you're expecting to interview is Henry  Dimbleby, who recently brought out his big food plan. And within that you have land zoning,  which is essentially land sparing by another name. I wonder what you're wanting to get  
**[0:10:58-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:10:58):**  out of that interview with Henry before you go in it. Is it finding out what he thinks  or is it to an extent challenging a little of what he thinks?  A little bit of both. But I think with this film, it's not our voices. We want to hear  
**[0:11:10-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:11:10):**  from the experts. So we like to hear how he's put it together, the background for everybody.  I think that's hugely educational because the research and work they did was enormous  here in his team. But now what he's doing is he's in government lobbying and spending  
**[0:11:23-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:11:23):**  a long time trying to get this white paper, which we haven't seen yet. So we need answers  from the government. So I'd love to hear from him what he thinks is happening and where  it's going. Claire, for you, what do you think the key  
**[0:11:34-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:11:34):**  messages of the film are going to be? I think keeping that in the name, it is in  there. It's all to do with soil. Soil to most people is just obviously this wonderful ground  thing that we grow, veg, crops, have our animals on. We want to try and bring the sort of sensory  
**[0:11:54-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:11:54):**  side of soil to people. We want to almost, a lot of them want to be able to smell it  through the screen. That's not going to be possible. But it's bringing it alive because  it's so complex. And we're just at the beginning of our journey with soil. So to delight the  
**[0:12:08-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:12:08):**  audience and to have those microscopic images of nematodes and things that are just alive  and phenomenal. We did a talk with children the other day about it, and they were really  engaged when we told them that one of the nematodes, don't ask me which or what, but  
**[0:12:22-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:12:22):**  he has apparently a harpoon and he goes out to get a fun one. We did this for kids. We  did it, we kept it simple. But even for adults, we are going to use animation in our film  to delight. And that'd be one of the aims is to recognise that soil is so important.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:12:37):**  So it's sort of making soil into a character, making soil itself into a character and a  community that you're talking to. Absolutely. When we have done our team meetings  recently, soil is one of the characters. So another key message is to reconnect people  
**[0:12:54-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:12:54):**  to food and farming, but where and how their food is produced. There are lots of films  and programmes on food, but it's really getting that, you know, closing the seed to fork journey  and getting them to understand more. And I think the other one, the big one, and I know  
**[0:13:09-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:13:09):**  you've discussed it on my new podcast is what does regen and agro-ecology actually mean?  You know, how is it term being used across and not being used well, etc. And to debunk  some of the myths behind it. One of the main audience we hope to appeal to is Beyond the  
**[0:13:23-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:13:23):**  Farm Gate. Those that are interested in being in rural affairs, probably we're not, you  know, it's a documentary, but give them an understanding. Now, I don't even know, you  know, how many people really know organic means. So put organic alongside that as well.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:13:37):**  And let's understand farming, but keep it simple and delightful. I think that's one  of the key messages as to reconnect people to all of that.  And I think you were indicating there the importance of whole food as well. If we're  
**[0:13:47-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:13:47):**  talking about soil and what's grown there is about keeping, keeping food as complete  as it can be in order to get the nutritional value out. And I, and the last podcast we  did was looking at the politics of protein and the way in which, you know, protein is  
**[0:14:01-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:14:01):**  seen as being this key nutrient, whereas actually it's just one of many nutrients. And then  just as there needs to be diversity in the soil, there needs to be diversity on the plate.  And I wonder whether you're looking or talking at all about the way in which many people  
**[0:14:15-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:14:15):**  are starting to replace whole meat products, whole dairy products with processed alternatives.  We will a hundred percent explore that and we will have experts speaking about it. And  we've been speaking to nutrient density experts, Stefan van Blyat in America, I had an amazing  
**[0:14:31-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:14:31):**  conversation with him, an ethical butcher. So we will be showing how the animals play  a key role in that regenerative process and how that meat can give you X, Y, Z nutrients,  but putting exactly right the protein in its, in its sort of whole form. And obviously out  
**[0:14:46-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:14:46):**  of that, we will discuss food poverty and food security.  Now films, generally speaking, tend to be about people and six inches of soil is no  different. You've already talked about the way in which soil is one of your characters.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:15:00):**  It's one of the communities that you're investigating, but on top of that, you have different people  that you're talking to that are bringing the story alive. And I wonder if you can tell  us a bit about some of the characters in your film.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:15:11):**  I would love to have a mega series on this, and maybe that's a long product because we've  met the most amazing characters. So the centre of our story will be those who are on a journey  on this, let's call it regenerative journey to regenerate their soil and their farm and  
**[0:15:28-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:15:28):**  lives. And so we've got a horticulturalist who is completely new to farming, to completely  new entrant. And then we've got who's Adrian, who's near here in Cambridge and then Anna  up in Lincolnshire has gone back to her dad's farm. So you'll see, so there are different  
**[0:15:41-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:15:41):**  issues for both of them. And then we've got George Young will play a big role now we've  decided because although you see him a lot within our community, I don't, the public,  I would say beyond farming, we don't exactly who farming George is, but he's had some real  
**[0:15:57-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:15:57):**  those this year. And it's great for everyone to know, we're not going to paint some glossy  picture is going to be the highest and those and those characters will be able to say why  they're doing it for the soil, for the health and food, etc. But we need to get under the  
**[0:16:12-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:16:12):**  under the skin a bit. That's what we're doing. We're spending more time with these people.  And we will take them to see or take them either experts will come to their farm or  take them to other farmers, policy experts, food experts, that's how we'll bring it to  
**[0:16:26-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:16:26):**  life. And we will get to know those people in their farm, what they're doing, and get  to understand the process through their journey. But also ask those big questions and those  sticky things that like, I don't know how to solve this. Okay, well, let's go and see  
**[0:16:39-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:16:39):**  someone else who's been doing it. So I recently connected with the amazing James Robinson  and you know, he's up in Cumbria and George said, I just love to meet that guy. You know,  he's got these five generations of deeply embedded, incredible experience in dairy farming  
**[0:16:55-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:16:55):**  with this biodiversity on his farm and George is trying to do things like that.  Just picking up on Claire's point, well, you know, what we've noticed from our research  and speaking with farmers up and down the country is the knowledge sharing aspect is  
**[0:17:07-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:17:07):**  is so important. And it's a big theme that runs through the film and it's happening now  and there's various organisations which you're partnered with, are already doing fantastic  work in this space. So we're FarmEd and Soil Association and Innovative Farmers. There's  
**[0:17:20-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:17:20):**  lots of things that are happening, lots of farm walks, workshops, conferences, where  a lot of this knowledge sharing is absolutely key. I mean, a groundswell as well, which  is a partner, there's so many different works, it's such a fascinating event. We want to  
**[0:17:32-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:17:32):**  use this film as a vehicle for showing people how regenerative practices work in an agro-ecological  context and part of the impact campaign was, you know, we'll have lots of things that don't  make the cut, lots of kind of expert pieces, techniques, how to's and we can use that bank  
**[0:17:48-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:17:48):**  of videos as a way to kind of extend the impact and life of the film as well. So farmers can  watch a video on how to cover crop or how to get longer roots and such and such. So  all these different things will still be part of the project but may not necessarily make  
**[0:18:03-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:18:03):**  it into the end cut of the film because you literally can't show everything because that  would be a 20 part series on regenerative agriculture. So the key thing is that we're  going to partner with those people who are already doing fantastic things in this space.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:18:14):**  And that's another reason coming back to the change mantra of the film, all good environmental  documentaries should be about knowing who your audience are and knowing what kind of  change you want to see in the world, whether that's individual, social, global, etc. And  
**[0:18:28-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:18:28):**  you know, a lot of farmers that are conventional, and I'm paraphrasing it, you know, they're  scared, they're worried about change, they don't want to make the change, they don't  have the knowledge. That's a huge barrier. It's one that's come up a lot in our conversations.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:18:40):**  Just to summarise, we have three farming characters, and they're all at different stages of their  regen journey, and the different types of farm and different scale of farm in different  parts of the country. We're an independent team, we're not tied into a broadcast, and  
**[0:18:53-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:18:53):**  so we want to be able to ask the tough questions. You know, the elephant in the room is climate  change. But it's also the fact that the current status quo of food and farming is, I say it's  a broken system, but some people may disagree with that. But you need to be quite, I think,  
**[0:19:06-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:19:06):**  controversial to wake people up, you know, you might say, well, it's not a broken system,  I can go to supermarket and get food, I can order food, it's cheap, you know, it's no  problem, that's not broken. But actually, the more you peel back the layers, you realise,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:19:16):**  well, there's so much that isn't costed for in the price of that food. And that's, I think,  a really important theme as well. And this ties in globally to other things, is that  the true cost of the things that we consume are hidden from us, whether it's environmental  
**[0:19:29-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:19:29):**  impact, social impact, health impact, we want to tackle that in the film. The pricing thing  is another issue we want to tackle as well. You know, why are agroecological, organic  products more expensive? Why can't they be cheaper? Why are poor people used as an excuse  
**[0:19:43-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:19:43):**  for this? You know, poor people can't afford these things, that's never going to work as  a middle class thing as well. These are really controversial topics, which you want to have  conversations around as well. And I've had to wrangle with this in my head and figure out  
**[0:19:54-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:19:54):**  in my head, I've had to read a lot and hear different voices, but it's not that poor people  can't afford better quality food, it's that cheap processed food is kept artificially cheap,  through subsidies, policies, mass production, etc. So the worst food for us is kept artificially  
**[0:20:09-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:20:09):**  cheap. You know, it's not a free market. And I think that's the key thing we want to address.  And there's no reason with the right opportunities and systemic change that we can't make really  healthy local food, ideally seasonally, but doesn't have to be cheaper for people, for  
**[0:20:23-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:20:23):**  everyone, so everyone can enjoy the healthy food and have relationships with their farmer.  You know, every city could have a market garden that feeds a third or half of the city. There's  no, with the right, I think, with the right motivation, all these things can happen. And  
**[0:20:35-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:20:35):**  we're seeing it happen. This revolution is happening, and we want to use the film as a  vehicle to kind of catalyse that revolution. Mason. At the start of what you were saying  there, Colin, you talked about a system that many people thought was broken. You talked about the  
**[0:20:47-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:20:47):**  way in which for many people, the food system is delivering because the food is staying relatively  cheap and plentiful. And then you mentioned climate as well. And I think it's really  interesting looking at the policy drivers that have taken over in the last few decades since  
**[0:21:02-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:21:02):**  government got heavily involved in agriculture. And that sort of drive for cheap food has led to  enormous external costs. So it's led to costs, environmental costs, social costs, which  haven't been embedded. Now, we're starting to understand that, so we're able to react to that.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:21:19):**  And the future for many people is about climate change, as you said. And there is a real danger  if climate change and climate change mitigation becomes the key driver for agriculture, that that  will distort things in a different way. At the moment, we're seeing a big focus on emissions  
**[0:21:36-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:21:36):**  rather than warming from emissions, for example, which excludes biodiversity restoration and soil  health from that story. So I wonder how important it is to address these distortions, to understand  these distortions. And that comes back, I guess, to that conversation that we were having about  
**[0:21:53-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:21:53):**  land sharing, where we start to fundamentally recognise and value a much more holistic approach  to food systems in general. I think it's really easy to get lost in the weeds in these sorts of  things, especially with climate change and trying to collect all these threads. But actually,  
**[0:22:09-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:22:09):**  it's really simple. When you do a farm work on organic farms or genocid farms, and you see the  health of the soil, you see the biodiversity, you see the flower corals, you see agroforest,  you see all these techniques, and you see the hard work that the farm has done with a vision,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:22:25):**  you know, 10, 20, 30 years out, it's all possible. It's all doable. And you can feed people. It's  really that simple. It's intuitive. You know that this is good for nature, because you can see it.  You don't need a report to tell you that. You don't need someone to come in and start selling  
**[0:22:39-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:22:39):**  you carbon tax credits. You know, you can literally see it, smell it and feel it with  nature alive on a farm, and it delivers food. That's how simple it is for me. And they're  doing this and they're doing this without subsidies. They're doing this without policy.  
**[0:22:51-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:22:51):**  They're just going ahead and doing it because they know that's the right thing to do. And it's  going to deliver for their family and for future generations and for their community. And there's  really no hard barriers as I see it to replicate that across the country. We will have this balanced  
**[0:23:06-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:23:06):**  discussion because it's not easy for farmers, although what Colin is saying is the essence of  what we will portray is there are a lot of farmers with these barriers, whether it's stage of life,  embedded tradition, huge amount of money they've spent on their equipment, they're tied into  
**[0:23:22-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:23:22):**  subsidies, tied into stewardships, etc. And also the knowledge, the knowledge sharing, and there  aren't enough agronomists or experts out there on the field, is what we've heard from farmers,  to support everyone and to guide them. And so we will show that, you know, you'll see it, for  
**[0:23:39-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:23:39):**  example, on all these farms that we're going to be covering, where there are some huge highs and lows  on this journey. So it's not going to be an unrealistic, glossy thing. And we do want to  recognise how tough it is for farmers. We're not having a go at farmers who are still stuck doing,  
**[0:23:53-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:23:53):**  because they're stuck in a system, they may be tied to huge commodity deals, etc. And so we  will recognise that. That's been really interesting, sort of looking at, you know, the heart of that  storytelling and some of the choices that you're making when you're planning the film. Colin, to a  
**[0:24:09-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:24:09):**  large extent, you're crowdfunding this film. Is that normal? And how do films usually get funded?  It's not normal. Traditionally, feature films, documentary feature films will be funded through  grants. So things like the BFI, the British Film Institute, Doc Society, and the big ones in this  
**[0:24:25-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:24:25):**  country, there'll be a combination, there'll be a mixed bag. So there'll be some film funding in  there, then maybe the producers put some equity into the film as well, they might have some  private donations. And that's typically how it's done. Or you might have some corporate sponsorship  
**[0:24:36-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:24:36):**  in there as well. For example, Sea-Spiritsy was mostly funded by the founder of Ecotricity,  even though he's not credited in the film, we know that that was, that's how the bulk of that  was funded. So... Which explains the strongly vegan side.  
**[0:24:49-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:24:49):**  Absolutely, yeah, absolutely. We thought long and hard about this, we've gone down traditional  routes, but it can be like banging head against a brick wall sometimes. And this isn't a typical  one character, art house type indie documentary, you know, we're dealing with multiple stakeholders,  
**[0:25:04-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:25:04):**  multiple levels, social aspects, the public are involved in part of this policy piece.  We have a bias as a filmmaking team, where this is not just a fly on the wall documentary,  we want to see change happen. That and that doesn't necessarily mesh with typical film funds.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:25:19):**  So we decided the crowdfunding route was a really good route. And secondly, it allows you to build  an audience and a community around the film. So one of the great things that's come out of our  crowdfunding campaign, we were building our community as well, we already had a strong  
**[0:25:30-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:25:30):**  following on our newsletter, but we were building up our audience as well and creating awareness.  The crowdfunding route has been great for, you know, we've hit our target, but we also generated  a community as well. And the money from the crowdfunding allows us to go into production  
**[0:25:43-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:25:43):**  this year and start shooting it. So yesterday I was with Claire on one of our character farms,  we were shooting yesterday and it's just, it's great to know that that money is there. So we  can just go ahead and do it. Otherwise, as you know, it's really, it's a real struggle,  
**[0:25:53-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:25:53):**  even though you'd be incredibly passionate about things, if you're not getting paid for it,  that only gets you so far. So... It's interesting, the way that you talk  about the sort of the democratic ownership, it reminds me a bit of Bitcoin, where the idea is  
**[0:26:05-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:26:05):**  that instead of having a state run currency, which is sort of vulnerable to the decisions that are  taken there, the idea is that you have a currency where all these accountancy decisions are checked  by the hive mind of the algorithm and the people behind it. And it kind of feels like it's somewhat  
**[0:26:24-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:26:24):**  a little bit similar, Claire, that you have lots of different people, so you're beholden to no one  and you're able to be much more independent and build this community at the same time.  Yeah, it's, it's, yeah, the building community has been an amazing, it's actually been an amazing  
**[0:26:41-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:26:41):**  experience. It's hard work. I'm not going to lie to you, I've never really made friends with social  media before, but wow, we've thrown ourselves in there. And thanks to an amazing following community,  it's, you know, it is, it's been, it's been great. It's really helped with my research and our team's  
**[0:27:00-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:27:00):**  research. We've got, we've got a fabulous team with us as well. And we've got people, you know,  reaching out saying, would you like to feature a farmer or topic or recently someone saying,  let's make a book. It's just like, it's brilliant, the networking that's come out of it. And we've  
**[0:27:16-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:27:16):**  latterly had funding when the crowdfunding, we did one crowdfunding official round to get the  production going. And so thanks to everybody out of it, we are now filming because we received,  we've got to our target and we also, in addition to it, to both Bolstrup, we got our first corporate  
**[0:27:35-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:27:35):**  funding. And as we were talking about earlier, we've obviously doing this, he really came as a  private funder, Dave Gordon, but he is the founder of Bamboo Clothing. So he has said, yes, you'd be  great. Let's put the company a bit. We aren't beholden to him or his company. He actually wants  
**[0:27:52-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:27:52):**  to buy a farm and a farm caring for the soil. He's passionate about soil health. So he's passionate  about this and he wants to see this happen. So and his colleague, or his friend has now come on board  as our executive producer, he's an amazing storyteller. So this has all come out of this  
**[0:28:07-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:28:07):**  crowd building crowdfunding experience. Another thing that's great through the crowdfunding  process, and as Claire mentioned, it's a challenging process, takes up a lot of time  and energy. And you really get stuck, you know, go through the ringer on it in terms of the  
**[0:28:23-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:28:23):**  intensity of the whole thing, especially when we had the Ukraine invasion as well, we think,  do we should we even launch a crowdfunder at this time, because this is really an appropriate time,  but no, this is a really positive story. And conversely, the Ukraine crisis is actually  
**[0:28:35-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:28:35):**  related to agriculture as well, which is really interesting to have these incredible soils in  Ukraine, the breadbasket of Europe, and all this, all these things as well, which ties into food  security, which we're going to talk about in the film. But I just want to say that, you know,  
**[0:28:46-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:28:46):**  going through that crowdfunding experience, it's really humbling to know that people believe in  you as a team, and the project and want to see this film happen. So it's a great way to get  feedback and test your prototype, test your idea to know that there's an audience for it. I think  
**[0:29:00-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:29:00):**  that's, that's my advice to anyone who's thinking of crowdfunding a film is that it's a great way  just to in and of itself to test an idea out and to build an audience, aside from just obviously  raising the funds to produce it. But I just want to echo Claire's thoughts and just thank everyone  
**[0:29:14-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:29:14):**  who's listening that perhaps donated to the film. And thank you so much for doing so. And also to  our fantastic team who have helped deliver this project so far, and we'll get it over the line  this year. So just shout out to them as well. You mentioned Ukraine there. And I think that's  
**[0:29:28-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:29:28):**  really interesting because of course, the war is about agriculture, agriculture and soil are,  you know, very much at the heart of that. And one of the things that I've been discussing with  colleagues recently is the way in which at the moment, all of Russia's exports are based on  
**[0:29:42-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:29:42):**  fossil fuels in one way or another, except its cereal production. I think it's the fourth biggest  cereal producer in the world, with Ukraine being something like the sixth. And if, if Russia has  ownership of Ukraine, it boosts its cereal production, its power with that commodity by 60%.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:29:58):**  So it's almost two thirds of their production sort of again. So it shows not only how important  it is in terms of this conflict, but actually potentially strategically how important food  and soil productivity is going to be in the future, you know, as we face the impacts of  
**[0:30:16-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:30:16):**  climate change and, and biodiversity loss. Now, let's come towards the end, you've talked about  funding, crowdfunding, how can people contribute? We still on our website, there's a big lovely  fund the film button. Please donate now. SixInchesOfSoil.org. You can go there or you can  
**[0:30:36-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:30:36):**  find us on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook with a similar handle SixInchToSoil. Equally, we have all  these incredible partners, you know, we can be giving money to us, you can also be following  their work that we follow and supporting campaigning. But yes, we'd ask you to watch,  
**[0:30:55-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:30:55):**  follow everything we're doing, donate if you can, or spread the love of this company or your company  you work for, get them involved. There's a community out there, we had an amazing event,  where we decided to open up and have a film discussion evening. So we showed some of our  
**[0:31:11-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:31:11):**  trailers and character pieces within an evening in Cambridge. And it was so vibrant and fabulous,  a soil scientist came and some others who are interested in environmental issues,  children and adults. We had this very fantastic conversation. There weren't any farmers there,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:31:28):**  but they were fascinated. Colin, what stage are you at now in terms of filming?  We're into production now. And this year is, you know, we want to be on the farms every season.  So it's spring, summer, autumn, winter, different activities on different farms. We've got a big  
**[0:31:41-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:31:41):**  plan for the year. And it's mostly around different seasons as different activities on the  farm. And then we're off the back of that, we're interviewing all the experts, which are less  dependent on seasonality. And we can do those in offices and on farms as well.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:31:54):**  And Claire, just finally, when can we expect to see the finished film and how are you going to be  distributing it?  Million dollar question, dealing with a documentary, I think it has some disaster on the farm. But  
**[0:32:04-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:32:04):**  we're looking at hopefully summer 2023 next year or the autumn.  And is it going to be in cinemas competing with Mission Impossible?  Wow, that would be great. We're going to Sheffield Film Festival in June. So we'll sit and we will  
**[0:32:17-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:32:17):**  try and sell it there and talk to people. It will likely be going to streaming service, but also  big things we haven't really discussed is the impact campaign. So produce the film, and someone  like C Sprits is doing this at the moment, Kisti Grandel is hugely and we create a public, it's  
**[0:32:36-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:32:36):**  a public, it's seen as a public educational piece. And it gets shown widely, whether it's farming  events, music events, rural events, things like transition, big environmental community, you  could have it then have discussions or workshops afterwards. And this is how we see it. And even  
**[0:32:54-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:32:54):**  taking it into educational establishment from agricultural to schools, and we could have a  shorter version as Kisti Grandel, they have a 30 minute one, and that idea could work really well.  So that's how we're going to get out there. That's how we're going to get out to communities is  
**[0:33:08-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Six-inches-of-Soil-e1i2g0p#t=0:33:08):**  probably mostly it will be able to be streamed from your home, but we'll try and have these  community events. Fantastic. That's great. Thanks so much, both of you. That's been a fascinating  insight into your world, into the world of filmmaking. So I'd like to thank my guests,

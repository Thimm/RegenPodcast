### Farm Gate  (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 10:30:24)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Kustein, the Chief Executive of Farmwell.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:10):**  The best solutions for land use deliver multiple outcomes, especially in places where land  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:15):**  is relatively scarce and expensive. In recent years, opponents of renewable energy, particularly  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:20):**  solar electricity with its large, glassy arrays, have argued that land should be kept in agricultural  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:26):**  production. From the other side, solar developers have argued that arrays are nearly always  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:30):**  sited on low-grade land and that biodiversity will benefit from the soil being given a break  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:35):**  from intensive monocropping. Well, what if we could do both? What if we could combine  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:40):**  the farming of electricity from the sun with land management that regenerates the soil  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:45):**  and produces high-quality nutrition? Sophie Fernley-Whittingstall lives in Wiltshire,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:49):**  in the UK, and provides community engagement and communications advice for the solar industry.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:54):**  Trent Hendricks is from Cabriero Ranch in Missouri, USA, where he produces lamb and  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:00:59):**  beef with certification from the American Grass Fed Association and the Allen Savory  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:04):**  Land to Market programme. Welcome both. Sophie, let's start with some basics. Solar farms  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:10):**  are large industrial installations which constrain land use for up to 40 years. So why is solar  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:16):**  on agricultural land a good thing? Well, Finnlow, as you said in your introduction, it's all  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:21):**  about multifunctional land use. Our land is under increasing amounts of pressure to deliver  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:27):**  lots of different objectives. And a solar farm isn't just about generating clean renewable  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:32):**  energy. It can tackle climate change through the energy generation, but it can also support  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:38):**  biodiversity in the ecological initiatives. And you can keep the land in agricultural  
**[0:01:43-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:43):**  use contributing to the supply of food, for example, with sheep grazing, honey bees making  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:50):**  honey and other food related initiatives. So why would a farmer want to have a solar  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:01:56):**  farm on their land in the first place? In the UK, certainly it's increasingly difficult  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:00):**  for farmers to make a good living from farming both due to Brexit and the implications of  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:05):**  that, and also due to the extreme weather conditions caused by climate change. I think  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:10):**  we've all seen evidence of that in Europe. Obviously, a solar farm can help with tackling  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:16):**  the climate emergency. But for a farmer, it can also provide a reliable, secure income  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:22):**  in terms of rental from the land, which is guaranteed for the life of the solar farm,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:27):**  which nowadays is about 40 years. After 40 years, all the infrastructure for the solar  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:32):**  farm can be completely removed. And the land can be returned to its original use, probably  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:38):**  in a better condition. Overall, the footprint of the infrastructure takes up only about  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:43):**  1% of the land take used. 1%? So there must be some distance between them if it's only  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:49):**  a 1% land impact. That's exactly right. So the solar panels are supported on frames that  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:02:54):**  are piled into the ground. There is no concrete used, other than for some of the supporting  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:00):**  infrastructure such as substations. And then wide gaps are left between the solar panels  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:06):**  to allow them to get the maximum amount of sunlight, but also that leaves plenty of space  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:10):**  for other farming activities to go on around them. Do you tend to have lots of cables sort  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:15):**  of trailing around the place or those buried under the soil? The cables are all buried  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:20):**  underground. There are some cables that are attached to the solar panels. Anything like  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:25):**  that is usually elevated so that it's out of the reach of an inquisitive sheep so that  
**[0:03:30-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:30):**  it's quite safe and secure. Now, Trent, you're a sheep farmer rather than a solar farmer,  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:35):**  but you've developed a pretty unique model for rearing livestock regeneratively in and  
**[0:03:40-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:40):**  amongst the solar arrays in the USA. How does your system work? It's an interesting marriage  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:46):**  of very old traditional livestock rearing in a relatively modern environment. For example,  
**[0:03:53-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:53):**  since the dawn of time, people have been taking their livestock to food, to feed, to grass,  
**[0:03:59-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:03:59):**  and following that we call it transhumance. And essentially what we're doing today is  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:03):**  the same principle, is we are taking our sheep to grass, the difference being that the grass  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:09):**  is under solar panels and we haul them there in trucks instead of going in a circuitous  
**[0:04:14-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:14):**  pattern up and down mountains and so forth. So we're really just applying age-old stock  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:21):**  rearing land management skill sets in a modern environment. That's really fascinating. It's  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:26):**  the idea that you're recreating something which is essentially a traditional form of  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:31):**  agriculture but then giving it this modern sort of more technical spin on it. And I'm  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:35):**  just curious, do you have to pay rent to get those grazing rights from the solar farm owners?  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:41):**  We are paid to manage vegetation on these sites. And so we receive payment for managing  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:48):**  the grass. We are given the contracts because we manage them predominantly with livestock  
**[0:04:53-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:53):**  leading to other attributes and outcomes on the land that one would probably not be able  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:04:59):**  to enjoy or participate in with a mechanical or chemical solution. So we are providing  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:04):**  a service and we are compensated for that.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:07):**  So in the same way that in the UK you've got farmers that are earning an income from having  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:12):**  the solar farm on their land, you're earning an income by managing, by servicing the solar  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:17):**  farms around and about in the USA. And you're quite a big business. You work in many different  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:21):**  states don't you, but you have different operations in different places around the USA.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:25):**  That is correct. More of a regional footprint. We do work in multiple states and the movement  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:31):**  of the animals is largely relative to the size of the properties. Originally many of  
**[0:05:36-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:36):**  the solar properties were rather small so those animals may get hauled more frequently  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:40):**  but typically very short hauls, 10 miles, 20 miles up the road. But as the solar industry  
**[0:05:46-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:46):**  is maturing, we are now looking at sites that are many thousands of acres and those sites  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:52):**  will have resident flocks where only the production is moved in and out of those sites under normal  
**[0:05:58-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:58):**  circumstances.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:05:59):**  And as a regenerative shepherd, when I think of regenerative grazing I'm generally thinking  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:05):**  of adaptive multi-paddock grazing, mob grazing, that sort of thing. Even within these larger  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:09):**  sites are you able to use that same principle and constrain the space that the sheep have?  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:15):**  Absolutely. That's a critical component for managing not only the vegetation but the welfare  
**[0:06:20-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:20):**  of the sheep from a consistent plan of nutrition to managing parasites, et cetera. We are always  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:27):**  moving them to clean ground and of course it's highly variable based off of the needs  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:31):**  of the animals, the size of the site, quality of the forage. I mean there's a lot of variables  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:35):**  that go in there. So yes, we do use holistic plan grazing that comes under a lot of different  
**[0:06:40-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:40):**  names, but essentially it's an intentional management plan moving sheep according to  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:46):**  the needs of the sheep, the land and the forage, and of course in a solar farm, the needs of  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:50):**  the solar farm operators.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:52):**  So essentially it's the same as being a regenerative shepherd anywhere else. It's just that you've  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:06:56):**  got this kind of additional constraint. And I wonder as a regen shepherd, what kind of  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:00):**  additional constraints you find on a solar farm that you wouldn't come across in a normal  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:05):**  field or ranch?  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:06):**  I think some of the biggest ones is interfacing with more people. The larger the solar site,  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:12):**  the more technicians, the more service oriented people that are getting out of sites and ensuring  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:17):**  simple things like gates being closed and preferably not having solar technicians having  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:22):**  to work in and around the sheep just for everybody's convenience factors. So we have another level  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:28):**  of scheduling, also working with routine maintenance on a solar farm, making sure that we've grazed  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:34):**  ahead of them to ensure that they're working in short drafts as much as possible. Most  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:39):**  of these solar farms have a very adequate external fence, but we do have predation issues  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:44):**  from time to time that need to be managed much like anywhere else. We would graze livestock.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:49):**  The biggest thing is just in a owned or leased pastured situation, we look at forage and  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:07:57):**  we say we can potentially store that forage. Whereas on a solar farm, we have specifications  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:03):**  we need to adhere to. And that may mean that we either need to graze more aggressively  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:08):**  or potentially mechanically intervene from time to time. So instead of managing the growth  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:14):**  of the grass and viewing it solely as food for the sheep, we also have to ensure that  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:19):**  it does not shade the site. The number one priority of a solar farm is to collect sunlight  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:25):**  for electricity so we cannot have grasses, forages, et cetera, limiting that production  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:30):**  and we can't have vegetation interference with mechanical hardware, et cetera. So there's  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:36):**  just a few filters or parameters that we would engage in on a solar farm that we would not  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:41):**  have to necessarily deal with in a traditional grazing environment.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:45):**  World Finance, when you're talking about the height of the grasses there, I'm thinking  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:49):**  about the rest periods that you tend to associate with regenerative grazing, where you have  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:54):**  long rest periods and you can have really quite high grasses. Does that mean that you  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:08:57):**  have shorter rest periods between grazing sessions perhaps than you might on a ranch  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:02):**  that didn't have the solar installation?  
**[0:09:04-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:04):**  David  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:04):**  Typically no. In our spring, when everything is growing very rapidly, that's typically  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:10):**  our biggest threat of shading time. If we can manage that first round of growth, we  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:15):**  can typically handle it quite well the rest of the season. There are variables there in  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:20):**  the type of forages planted in the south, in the mid-south. In the United States, a  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:24):**  lot of warm season perennial type plants, plants that grow by rhizome. They're typically  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:30):**  height limited in a natural state anyway, but they also tend to be lower quality feed.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:35):**  So we've found that in order to manage the rapid growth of grass in the spring across  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:41):**  thousands of acres, it's difficult to do that. You never have enough sheep in the spring,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:47):**  and it's easy to have too many sheep in the late summer or winter. So that's a balance  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:52):**  that we have to manage more closely in a solar situation than we would in a non-solar situation.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:09:59):**  And sometimes we will mechanically manage grass for two reasons. One, it buys us time  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:04):**  to ensure that it doesn't shade, but it also means that when we do bring the sheep in,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:10):**  the feed value of that grass is higher. But we are not typically sacrificing rest time.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:17):**  In fact, I would say that we do a pretty good job of ensuring there is complete rest between  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:22):**  grazing. And what we do is we hit the grass typically harder than we might else wise to  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:28):**  make sure that it's set back sufficiently so we can give it the time it needs and have  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:33):**  all the species of forage have an equal chance to regrow before we come back again. So, you  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:39):**  know, sometimes we do a great job, sometimes not so much. It's nature. You know, we definitely  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:44):**  look, use feedback loops to ensure that we're continuously improving.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:48):**  And what about the sheep and the technology itself? Do you have sheep sort of leaning  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:53):**  on things or chewing things that then get damaged or vice versa? Do you have sheep that  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:10:57):**  get injured by rubbing up against the corner of something that they shouldn't?  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:01):**  No, we've not seen that could be an issue. It's a frequent question. We've learned that  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:05):**  inverter pads are, it's a good idea to put a little fence around them to exclude the  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:11):**  sheep from them because it's in the sheep's nature to fill their belly and then go find  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:16):**  a hive place to lay down and ruminate. And they like the high ground for a couple of  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:20):**  reasons, including looking out for predators and possibly more importantly, enjoying the  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:25):**  breeze that they get. And inverter pads on solar sites tend to be some of the higher  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:29):**  ground and they like to lay on them and when they stand up, they ignore and the cooling  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:34):**  fans on the inverters draw air in and you can potentially foul the inside of that. We've  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:41):**  also had one situation where there was an emergency stop button that was at an ideal  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:45):**  location for sheep to scratch their backs on and it shut down a portion of the array.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:51):**  So we've learned it's much simpler just to put a small fence around it, keep the sheep  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:55):**  off of it. Other than that, no, not really. Sometimes there's roads in a site they like  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:11:59):**  to lay down on the roads for similar reasons and so that can foul roads up a little bit.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:04):**  Good rain usually takes care of that. Gray dogs, feral dogs are a bigger issue. More  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:09):**  suburban environments, but you know, you deal with that in a non-solar environment as well.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:15):**  So there's a lot less friction with the sheep and the equipment. The sheep adapt actually  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:20):**  quite quickly and typically we don't see an issue.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:23):**  So in your business, you're earning money as a shepherd, rearing sheep and selling the  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:28):**  sheep. You're also earning money by servicing these solar installations, using the sheep  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:33):**  to do that. Now this is a pretty unique business model, it seems to me, from across in the  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:38):**  United Kingdom. Are you unique across in the USA or are there loads of people doing this?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:43):**  It is growing very, very rapidly. It's still very much the early days and that's part of  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:49):**  why we enjoy getting an opportunity to speak about what we do to ensure that the industry  
**[0:12:55-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:12:55):**  is growing professionally. There's a lot of small operators and that's a fantastic thing,  
**[0:13:01-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:01):**  but we do want to make sure that as an industry, we begin to identify efficiencies in performance  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:09):**  and delivery in the business structures, the costing models, et cetera. And it is a fantastic  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:15):**  opportunity and you know, just a small aside on that is part of why we see it as a fantastic  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:21):**  opportunity is agriculture is extremely capital intensive, very thin margins, very subjective  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:27):**  to environmental impact and market cycles. If a producer can secure a multi-year contract  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:34):**  to take care of land for a solar provider, it now has consistency of cashflow. It allows  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:40):**  the producer to invest more aggressively into CapEx and capital expenditures. It also provides  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:47):**  that cashflow baseline and we see it as a fantastic opportunity for new producers and  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:53):**  young producers and family businesses that want to create opportunity for younger family  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:13:57):**  members to participate. So it really is a fantastic opportunity for agriculture. We  
**[0:14:03-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:03):**  have a great desire to do our bit to ensure that it becomes a good viable industry that  
**[0:14:11-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:11):**  we would love to see the vast majority of solar farms managed in this way.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:14):**  Sophie, I'm really interested in how this experience in the USA can transpose to the  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:20):**  UK. Sheep already quite often feature on solar farms around Britain. And I wonder how those  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:25):**  relationships between solar developers and farmers come about as it stands and whether  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:30):**  this sort of model that Trent's talking about exists here at all.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:34):**  Well, yes, sheep have been grazing on solar farms since the early days of the solar industry  
**[0:14:39-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:39):**  in the UK, dating back to around 2013, mainly because large scale solar farms are usually  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:46):**  built on agricultural land and the landowner or landowners because nowadays solar farms  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:52):**  are getting increasingly large, they may already farm sheep. If they don't, they usually know  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:14:58):**  somebody else who does. I'm working on an interesting project at the moment with two  
**[0:15:03-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:03):**  landowners. One is an organic sheep farmer and part of the site will be grazed by sheep  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:10):**  all the year round, because that's part of their business model. The other part of the  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:14):**  site, we're looking to maximise the ecological and biodiversity benefits a little more. So  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:20):**  the sheep grazing will happen in the autumn and the winter, which will allow the wildflowers  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:25):**  to get established and set seed in the spring and the summer. So there are a lot of different  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:30):**  ways that you can manage a sheep grazing regime on a solar farm here in the UK. And yes, it's  
**[0:15:36-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:36):**  something that we're seeing more and more of now.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:38):**  And are you aware of any solar farms in the UK that have sheep on them using an adaptive  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:43):**  multi paddock approach, for example, using electric fences to constrain the area that  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:49):**  the sheep are in, you know, more than the field itself? Or is it that they generally  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:53):**  go in and they have the run of the field?  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:15:54):**  I haven't seen that in the UK. Our land pattern tends to consist of smaller fields, I think  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:01):**  than in the US. So what I do see and I live very close to a solar farm, which I walk past,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:07):**  you know, three, four times a week. And I noticed that the farmer moves the sheep from  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:11):**  field to field. You know, they will stay in one field for a week or so and then they'll  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:17):**  move into the next field. But I haven't seen the fields subdivided up like that with electric  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:23):**  fencing here. But I don't see why it wouldn't work here if it works in the States.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:27):**  And I wonder, you know, where the incentive comes from, or where the idea comes from to  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:32):**  actually have a solar farm in a particular place. Is it farmers that are getting in touch  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:35):**  with solar developers? Or is it the solar developers getting in touch with the farmers?  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:40):**  Is it the farmers developing the solar themselves?  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:42):**  It's a bit of both really. The number one constraint on where you can put a solar farm  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:47):**  is a connection to the electricity grid. Increasingly, as the electrical grid is becoming more  
**[0:16:52-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:52):**  constrained here, we're looking for other opportunities as well. So for example, you  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:16:57):**  might want to put in a solar farm that has a private wire direct connection to a large  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:02):**  energy user, say close to an industrial unit or a supermarket or something like that. But  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:08):**  the number one constraint is access to the electricity grid.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:11):**  So if you're just talking about constraints in the grid connection, I mean, how far away  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:15):**  does a solar farm need to be from a grid connection? And why is that?  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:19):**  Well, you can build a solar farm up to about 10 kilometres away from a grid connection.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:24):**  10 kilometres? That's quite a long way actually.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:27):**  Yes, you can sometimes connect directly into the grid on site if you've got pylons or overhead  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:32):**  electricity lines crossing the site. But also if grid capacity is constrained, you can look  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:37):**  at connecting directly into an energy user as well, which is happening more and more  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:43):**  here in the UK, particularly since it's become harder to make the economics of solar work  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:48):**  with the withdrawal of subsidies.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:50):**  You just mentioned subsidies there. And of course, you know, going back sort of five  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:54):**  years or so, there were a lot of community scale solar farms. And these days, they tend  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:17:59):**  to be much bigger. Why has that change happened? Why aren't their community scale solar farms  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:04):**  now?  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:05):**  Well, we call it the solar coaster in the UK because of the very rapid changes in government  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:09):**  policy, which have had a big influence on the size and scale of projects that have been  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:15):**  developed. There was no solar development at all between about 2016 and 2019. And now  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:22):**  because of the falling costs of solar, it has become economical without a subsidy, but  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:28):**  it means that you have to do the projects at a much larger scale. So you're seeing now  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:32):**  developers developing projects of around 50 megawatts, which is still of a scale that  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:38):**  can be decided by the local authority rather than by the national government. And now a  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:42):**  50 megawatt solar farm is probably you're looking at a capital cost of around 25 million  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:47):**  pounds. That puts it out of the reach of most community energy projects or developers. But  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:18:54):**  increasingly, we're seeing developers partner up with community groups to offer shared ownership  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:00):**  in their solar farms, and community investment in the solar farm so that communities can  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:04):**  still get involved with them. But that way, they leave the tricky stuff of raising large  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:09):**  amounts of money to the developers and their investors, but the community can still get  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:14):**  involved and have a share of the profits going back into support the local economy by working  
**[0:19:20-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:20):**  in partnership with larger developers.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:21):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:17):**  So those larger developments that we're talking about now, they're up to 50 megawatts, as  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:26):**  you say. I've seen, remember that community solar farms tended to be around sort of five-ish  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:31):**  megawatts. Is that right? So they were obviously much smaller. And what kind of land area are  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:36):**  we talking about for 50 megawatts?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:37):**  Karen Dodd  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:39):**  So for a 50 megawatt solar farm, you need around 200 acres of land. It's got to be relatively  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:44):**  level land that can be easily screened from any neighbourhood properties because people  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:49):**  don't like to look at solar farms, and they don't like to look at solar panels where they  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:54):**  had green fields before. So we make sure that we can put, if there aren't already existing  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:19:59):**  mature hedges and woodland, we make sure that we can plant those to fill up any gaps so  
**[0:20:04-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:04):**  that people don't have to look at the panels. They also need to be on areas that don't have  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:10):**  any special landscape designations. So it's difficult to build a solar farm in an area  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:14):**  of outstanding natural beauty. It may be difficult or more challenging in Greenbelt. And finally,  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:21):**  we look for areas of land that are not best and most versatile. So that means a grade  
**[0:20:27-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:27):**  3B or below.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:28):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:29):**  And of course, it's that sort of land that often can benefit the most from a regenerative  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:32):**  approach to agriculture, where you're improving the quality of that land and recycling the  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:36):**  nutrients, getting it working better than it was before. So from that perspective, it's  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:40):**  really interesting to hear when you've got a large area like that, that ability to stack  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:45):**  enterprises becomes really important.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:47):**  Yes, absolutely. And you know, as I mentioned at the beginning, it's about using your land  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:52):**  to deliver more than one objective. If you have solar panels on the land, the land underneath  
**[0:20:57-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:20:57):**  it managed positively with wildflower meadows to boost biodiversity and ecology, increase  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:03):**  the number of pollinators on the land. You're also benefiting from carbon sequestration.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:09):**  But perhaps the biggest benefit is you're no longer pumping lots of chemicals into the  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:13):**  land in order to be able to get a crop off it. The land is regenerating itself over time.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:19):**  Trent, one of the key reasons that you talk to people like me is that you want to demonstrate  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:23):**  that regenerative agriculture is a big solution, that regen is possible at scale. Now, I know  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:29):**  that you don't want to go into specifics about the size of your business, but are you able  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:33):**  to give us some idea of the size of your flock? Because we're really not talking in terms  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:37):**  of two or 300 ewes, are we?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:39):**  No, and we do run quite a few ewes, several thousands, but we also purchase many thousands  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:47):**  of feeder lambs or stocker lambs from other producers that we take through the green season  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:52):**  and then fatten and harvest. So we're running many, many thousands of lambs as well as thousands  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:21:58):**  of ewes across. So we would view it as a commercially viable, statistically viable operation going  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:04):**  across many, many thousands of acres. And really the pipeline of growth of additional  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:09):**  land coming online under solar is staggering. That's one of the things that we're looking  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:15):**  at as an industry, oddly enough, is are there enough sheep to handle the growth in solar  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:21):**  in the next decade. So we're having larger conversations about how do we ensure that  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:26):**  there's enough animals and equally importantly enough people trained to manage animals to  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:32):**  ensure that we can manage this land and vegetation under solar in the most ecologically viable  
**[0:22:38-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:38):**  way possible.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:39):**  How big are the solar farms that you're working with and how many sheep are you likely to  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:43):**  be managing in an individual farm? Is there a rule of thumb?  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:47):**  Not so much. There's a lot of variables that impact it. However, we're looking at sites  
**[0:22:52-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:52):**  that are many thousands of acres contiguous one single site, even a site that say only  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:22:57):**  500 acres, we may still have 3000 sheep on that site. Again, there's a variety of reasons  
**[0:23:03-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:03):**  we do that. It is more cost effective to run a larger band of sheep on a site than to build  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:10):**  lots of temporary fence to move them around. So we can, particularly most of our properties  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:16):**  are if they're not connected are still in a relatively small area that we might move  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:22):**  them 20 miles up the road. It may be on a larger site for two months and then they may  
**[0:23:26-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:26):**  spend a week at a time on a handful of smaller sites and then come back in a planned grazing  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:33):**  rotation. Just a small aside on that is that allows not only for full recovery of the plants,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:40):**  but supports the biodiversity so that ground nesting birds have a chance to have their  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:44):**  eggs hatch and the young birds become young adults and be able to leave that environment  
**[0:23:49-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:49):**  before we come back and graze. It allows plants to set seed and flowers and attract pollinators.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:23:55):**  There's a variety of reasons why we do that impact and having sheep continuously graze  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:01):**  not only could lead to potential degradation of the land, but certainly would not support  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:06):**  whole healthy, biodiverse environment that is the main reason we were contacted by solar  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:12):**  in the first place is our track record of working with the Savory Institute and being  
**[0:24:15-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:15):**  able to verify and validate that we can regenerate plants and we can sequester carbon. We can  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:22):**  do these things and it's just really exciting to be able to have a chance to do it at a  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:26):**  much larger scale with a higher visibility project.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:30):**  I want to come on to your relationship with the Savory Institute in just a little while,  
**[0:24:35-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:35):**  but before we do that, I'd like to pick up on the welfare element because I know that  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:38):**  there will be people who are listening to this podcast who are perhaps uncomfortable  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:42):**  with the idea of livestock being transported in large numbers in trucks between different  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:48):**  solar installations every few days. So I just wonder if you could help us out and talk through  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:53):**  that transportation element and talk about how you ensure the health and welfare of your  
**[0:24:57-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:57):**  flock.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:24:58):**  Yeah, absolutely. We believe in having a very transparent operation through education awareness  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:04):**  that people learn and become more comfortable with ideas that perhaps at first blush they  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:10):**  may have a reaction to. We're very careful about the genetics. We select for a variety  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:16):**  of reasons. We work in a hot area that tends to be quite humid and not all sheep thrive  
**[0:25:22-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:22):**  under those conditions. So we've largely settled on hair sheep in this case, predominantly  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:29):**  Dorper and Dorper crossbred sheep that can handle the stress of the heat and the humidity.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:35):**  They also, interestingly enough, by default, are browsers or non-selective grazers having  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:42):**  originated in South Africa as a cross between the Persian fat tail and the Dorset sheep.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:48):**  And these are very docile sheep. It's almost like a milk cow. We work with them all the  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:53):**  time and when we go to gather, we actually have learned that we make sure we do not open  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:25:59):**  the doors on the trucks and trailers until we're ready because they will simply walk  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:04):**  on themselves. It's like calling cows to a new pasture through a gate. They know there's  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:08):**  fresh grass on the other side. And so they're like, hey, you know, let us in, let us in,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:13):**  take us to somewhere else where there's fresh grass. And it's just really not the stress  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:17):**  on the animals that people would maybe think if they didn't have the experience of working  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:21):**  with livestock. That being said, we have very vigorous health protocols that we follow.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:27):**  We have put gobs of money and time into researching the mineral supplements that we need. We've  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:34):**  got some excellent supplements that we work with manufacturers to ensure that the nutritional  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:39):**  needs of the sheep are met, particularly with the variables and forage type and quality  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:44):**  to ensure that gut health is optimal. When you have a ruminant, if you can keep that  
**[0:26:49-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:49):**  room in full and functioning well, that animal can handle a lot, whether it's external stress,  
**[0:26:55-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:26:55):**  internal parasite stress, variations in feed quality and volume, keeping that animal healthy  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:02):**  and digesting well is absolutely critical. And so that's a big area of our focus. And  
**[0:27:07-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:07):**  we run all very late model equipment specifically designed to allow for maximum airflow at the  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:15):**  same time for winter transport. All the trailers can be boarded up so that there's minimal  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:19):**  airflow to ensure that the animals are maintained at a comfortable level. So we take animal  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:24):**  welfare very, very seriously. In fact, there is not a livestock producer in the world that  
**[0:27:30-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:30):**  has anybody care more about their animals than they do. That is our wealth. That is  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:35):**  our financial security is in those animals. And there is nothing more important to us  
**[0:27:41-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:41):**  than ensuring that those animals are as healthy and happy as we can make them. We take care  
**[0:27:47-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:47):**  of the sheep, the sheep take care of us. It's fascinating, isn't it? Because you're  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:50):**  talking there about this really synergistic model that you're running where there is energy  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:55):**  being produced, there's food being produced, there's biodiversity being produced because  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:27:59):**  of the way that you're managing the sheep in a regenerative way. You're building soil,  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:05):**  organic matter, drawing down more carbon at the same time as you've got the renewable  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:10):**  electricity that's reducing the carbon intensity on the grid as well. It's really interesting  
**[0:28:15-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:15):**  stuff. And Sophie, of course, there are direct welfare benefits for sheep being grazed in  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:21):**  solar farms too, aren't there? Well, yes, absolutely. So in times of bad  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:25):**  weather, the solar panels provide shelter from the wind and the rain. And in times of  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:31):**  extreme heat, they can provide shade. And I have had anecdotal evidence from farmers  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:37):**  that their actual yield of land has gone up slightly.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:40):**  So it's not just the welfare, but the health of the sheep that are being impacted as well.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:45):**  In Britain, we've talked a little bit about different ways of managing the sheep within  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:49):**  a solar farm installation. But I'm wondering if you've come across examples of other regenerative  
**[0:28:54-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:54):**  farming or other farming systems around solar that don't include sheep.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:28:58):**  At almost all the solar farm projects that I work on in the UK, we invite beekeepers  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:05):**  to keep beehives on the solar farm or on land immediately adjacent to the solar farm. But  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:12):**  they like to keep their hives inside the solar farm because the fence provides an element  
**[0:29:16-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:16):**  of security. Again, I've had a beekeeper tell me that his honey yield has increased since  
**[0:29:22-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:22):**  the pollinating flowers were grown around the solar panels. He also has seen less of  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:29):**  the nasty predatory Asian hornet. In other countries, they're experimenting with growing  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:33):**  fruit and vegetables on solar farms. As long as the width between the rows of panels is  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:39):**  wide enough for a small tractor, which it usually is, there's no reason why you can't  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:44):**  grow, for example, soft fruit like raspberries and so on. We're not quite there yet in the  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:50):**  UK, but I think that is probably the direction that we'll be going in. And that goes by the  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:54):**  good name of agrivoltaics.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:29:57):**  You'd be able to grow arable as well. It would just be a different way of doing it. And there  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:01):**  are plenty of farmers that we've spoken to who are growing lines of trees with arable  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:06):**  rides in between them. The same could be true with solar.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:08):**  Yes, since you said that I thought of agroforestry, yes. I don't see why you shouldn't. Yeah,  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:13):**  absolutely.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:14):**  Trent, your impact as a regenerative farmer is monitored. You're certified by the American  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:19):**  Grass Fed Association as well as by Savory Land to Market programs. What did the people  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:23):**  at the Savory Institute think about your approach to regenerative agriculture when you first  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:28):**  talked to them? It must have been an original concept for them.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:32):**  They're a very creative bunch. We've been working with them for many years now and just  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:38):**  really impressed with their worldview. They're about doing good everywhere. And while some  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:44):**  people may not want to look at a sea of glass, whether we agree with it or not, it is happening  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:50):**  and it is going to continue to happen. So how do we make the best of it? How do we add  
**[0:30:55-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:30:55):**  the most value to this essentially inevitable tide of solar production? And there's nothing  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:02):**  singular in nature. There are very few examples that say this is a standalone species with  
**[0:31:08-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:08):**  no impact against it or on others. That just isn't part of nature. Everything is in holds.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:14):**  Alan Savory and the Savory Institute are all about understanding holds, the W-H-O-L-E-S.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:21):**  And the holistic management is about considering everything from every angle. It's about the  
**[0:31:26-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:26):**  relationships between. And they're being incredibly supportive of our work. In fact, we've worked  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:34):**  with other members of the Savory Institute in other countries around the world, giving  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:39):**  them the benefit of our experiences. They evaluate solar grazing opportunities in their  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:44):**  countries and regions. So a tremendous amount of support and we're able to verify and validate  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:51):**  that the land under solar is in fact regenerating.  
**[0:31:54-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:54):**  When you talk about demonstrating that, Trent, can you just give us an idea of some of the  
**[0:31:58-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:31:58):**  outcomes that you're measuring there?  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:00):**  Yeah. So we use the ecological health index or ecological outcome verification, which  
**[0:32:06-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:06):**  is a myriad of data points reduced to an ecological health index, a single number representing  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:12):**  the property on a baseline of a year evaluation. And we do long-term studies every five years  
**[0:32:19-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:19):**  and we do short-term monitoring every year in between. And that allows us to identify  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:25):**  on a range of minus 100 to plus 100, we plug in that ecological health index number. And  
**[0:32:31-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:31):**  as long as that number is improving or increasing year over year, it's a positive trend line.  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:37):**  Therefore we can say that the land is regenerating and land regeneration results in many, many  
**[0:32:42-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:42):**  variables. For example, we have seen land under our management go from 1% organic matter  
**[0:32:50-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:50):**  to over 4% in less than six years. We have seen water retention, water absorption rates  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:32:57):**  increase dramatically. The world is beginning to wake up to the fact that water is more  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:02):**  important than oil. And we need to understand how to be stewards of that water to ensure  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:07):**  that there's sufficient clean water widely dispersed for all of our needs and how we  
**[0:33:12-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:12):**  manage the land directly connects to water availability and quality. And so being a steward  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:19):**  of these lands and having the tools provided by the Savory Institute to not only manage  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:24):**  the land, but to also be able to pull statistically viable data that allows us to make better  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:30):**  decisions that also verifies and validates that yes, progress has indeed been made or  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:36):**  in some instances progress may not have been achieved, but then we have a feedback loop  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:42):**  that allows us to say, okay, here's what didn't work. Here's what went wrong or here are the  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:48):**  factors outside of our influence that contributed to this situation. How do we pivot? What do  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:54):**  we do differently? You know, if in fact do we need to do anything differently or is this  
**[0:33:59-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:33:59):**  an anomaly in a weather pattern that we simply need to power through? So being able to have  
**[0:34:05-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:05):**  a model that allows us to evaluate and have continuous improvement through feedback is  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:12):**  phenomenally valuable. And quite frankly, that's why our family business was approached  
**[0:34:18-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:18):**  initially by solar was as a result of having that experience in that formula and cooperation  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:25):**  with the Savory Institute. So there's some forward thinking people in solar that are  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:30):**  saying, hey, whether we intended or not at the outset, we are stewards and owners of  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:35):**  vast swaths of land. What are we going to do with that? One, it has to be managed, but  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:40):**  how can we manage it in a way that has the most desirable results with a moderate cost  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:46):**  structure and by managing land in a way that can be verified as regenerating, it positions  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:34:53):**  the land to potentially participate in ecometric or carbon schemes for additional revenue flows  
**[0:35:01-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:01):**  that could possibly one day offset the cost of managing that land. So it's a very genuinely  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:08):**  capitalistic approach while also a very environmentally aware and sensitive approach.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:14):**  That's really fascinating. I'm really interested in that statistic that you gave us there of  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:19):**  going from 1% organic matter to 4% organic matter in six years. There's a lot of argument  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:25):**  that's taking place at the moment about the degree to which soil can be grown, soil carbon  
**[0:35:30-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:30):**  can be grown. And I just wonder what your own view is, Trent, about the amount of soil  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:37):**  that can be accrued, the amount of organic matter. Is it finite or does it just keep  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:42):**  going? You know, it's a good question and I don't think anybody has a finite answer  
**[0:35:48-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:48):**  on that. We know that there is no doubt that we can build healthy soil. We know that if  
**[0:35:55-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:35:55):**  we do not adopt more regenerative practices, we will lose soil and degenerate soils through  
**[0:36:02-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:02):**  monoculture cropping and extractive cropping and mining approaches. So really why is that  
**[0:36:10-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:10):**  a goal of a finite number? Because who would have believed we could move from 1% to 4%  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:16):**  in six years of organic matter. So if they said, no, you can only do 1% every 10 years,  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:22):**  then we would not have achieved what we achieved. So I'm reluctant to say, here's where the  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:27):**  ceiling is. I would say we can demonstrate, we can validate, we can prove without any  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:33):**  argument that we can build soil. We can increase the organic matter, which essentially leads  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:39):**  to, you know, storing more carbon in the ground. An interesting detail as we've evaluated this  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:45):**  particular property in the last few days that we got this data on is that we have monitored  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:51):**  the land output production of agricultural product, in this case livestock. And essentially  
**[0:36:57-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:36:57):**  for every one point of increase in organic matter, we're having a one fold increase in  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:04):**  animal livestock production on the same land base. So when we went from 1% to 4% organic  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:10):**  matter, we increased the agricultural output of that same land by approximately 4x as well.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:17):**  Do we think over the next decade that same rate of increase will be maintained? Doubtful.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:25):**  I don't say it's impossible, but I am also not foolish enough to say that it's a guarantee.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:31):**  But what if we don't achieve that? What if we only achieved 10% of that? That's a fricking  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:35):**  home run. I mean, that's amazing. It's a whole win. There's no argument. And so I think people  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:40):**  discuss the wrong things. I think they're focused on the wrong metrics. I think that  
**[0:37:45-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:45):**  their motivations may be suspect. And so really, we just prefer to focus on the positive outcomes  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:53):**  that we can validate within our own enterprises. And we could not be more excited about our  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:37:59):**  ability to steward the land in ways that lead to incredibly positive outcomes as a whole.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:05):**  Sophie, just finally, one of the issues that we've been coming back to quite a lot in the  
**[0:38:11-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:11):**  podcast recently, particularly in the Land Unlocked series that we've been doing with  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:15):**  the Food Farming and Countryside Commission in the run up to COP26, is the importance  
**[0:38:19-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:19):**  of power being given back to people in having local power to deliver change on the ground  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:27):**  and taking it back from some of the big corporate profit centres that exist. So in terms of  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:32):**  solar farms, whether it's here or in the USA, they're often owned by people in profit centres  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:37):**  that can be quite far removed from the land itself. And I wonder if that's a concern?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:42):**  Well, not really. First of all, the farmers who host the solar farms are getting a rental  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:48):**  income for having solar panels on their land, which allows them to continue to farm in the  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:53):**  way that they want to, that is probably best for the planet. But then secondly, many solar  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:38:59):**  farm projects will put money back into the local community through a community benefit  
**[0:39:04-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:04):**  fund or through a community ownership scheme, as we discussed earlier. But then eventually,  
**[0:39:11-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:11):**  solar farms are assets, just like many other things. And a lot of them end up being owned  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:16):**  by pension funds. As you know, there's a big move afoot for pension funds to divest away  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:22):**  from investments in fossil fuels. And a solar farm is a really good asset for a pension  
**[0:39:28-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:28):**  fund to invest in because it is stable and predictable returns. And so anybody who has  
**[0:39:34-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:34):**  a pension is benefiting indirectly from that solar farm. And then I suppose the final issue  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:40):**  that we haven't actually covered is that solar energy is currently one of the cheapest new  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:46):**  forms of energy generation in the world on a par with onshore wind. In some places, it's  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:51):**  cheaper. And so the benefits of solar are being felt in everybody's pockets, because  
**[0:39:57-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:39:57):**  it's helping to bring down energy costs for everybody.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:40:00):**  So that's really interesting. You're saying that although that profit centre might be  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:40:04):**  elsewhere, because you've got the farmer, because you've got that local land, because  
**[0:40:08-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:40:08):**  you're engaging with the community in the design of that solar farm, and because there  
**[0:40:14-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:40:14):**  might be a community fund associated with it, quite apart from the fact that then the  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:40:17):**  investments are going into people's pension funds, that there is a sort of a cycle that  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:40:21):**  brings it back to local people in the end anyway. That's fantastic. That's been so interesting.  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Stacking-sheep--solar-energy-e163cga#t=0:40:26):**  But that's all we've got time for. I'd like to thank my guests, Trent Hendricks and Sophie

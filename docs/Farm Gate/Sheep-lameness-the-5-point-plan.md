### Farm Gate  (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 12:27:37)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. There are conditions so prevalent  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:10):**  on farms that they are regarded by many as just simply endemic, ever-present, regardless  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:16):**  of the efforts made to curb new infections. Sheep lameness is one of these conditions.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:21):**  But is lameness endemic? Can more effective monitoring and treatment effectively eradicate  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:26):**  it from flocks? I'm joined by Ruth Clements, the head of veterinary programs from Benchmark  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:31):**  Animal Health, and by Claire Hill, the farm manager from FAI Farms. Hello both.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:37):**  Hello.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:38):**  Maybe you could just introduce yourselves and tell us what your link is with sheep and  
**[0:00:43-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:43):**  lameness more generally.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:45):**  Yes, hi, I'm Ruth Clements. Long history with dealing with lameness, both practically  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:50):**  and in a flock that I helped to manage, but also researching into lameness, and particularly  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:56):**  looking at practical actionable solutions that could be shared with the wider farming  
**[0:01:02-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:02):**  community. And yeah, particular interest in endemic disease and trying to find some solutions  
**[0:01:08-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:08):**  to some of these really difficult diseases.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:10):**  And obviously, we're going to be talking about the five point plan. That's the purpose of  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:14):**  this podcast. And this is something that you've been working on developing over the course  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:18):**  of many years and which has been implemented fairly successfully, I think, on many farms  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:23):**  now. And Claire, you're the farm manager at FAI, you've had some experience of implementing  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:28):**  the five point plan.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:29):**  Yeah, that's right. I have both here at FAI Farms and also in my own flock of sheep, which  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:36):**  started in 2012. And which has given me an interesting angle because I've come into a  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:41):**  flock here, which was already using five point plan, and I started it from a maybe a higher  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:48):**  place of lameness with my own flock.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:51):**  Fantastic. So before we go into the details of the plan and what that is and how it can  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:56):**  help farmers and vets to reduce lameness in flocks, maybe we could just start with talking  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:02):**  about lameness more generally. I mean, what causes it and why is it a problem?  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:07):**  Yeah, well, I mean, a sheep shows lameness primarily in response to pain, as you described  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:12):**  earlier. And as such, this does represent a welfare problem for that individual animal.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:18):**  But in addition, a lame sheep is less likely to be eating as much, which can lead to lost  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:24):**  productivity for the farmers, both in terms of ewes, milking ability and also lamb growth.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:29):**  And so the disease is a sustainability blocker in many ways, but also it can leave them more  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:36):**  susceptible to other diseases such as fly strike. But to add to the above, it's the  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:40):**  big economic cost to farmers. Sheep that are not as productive are costly, together with  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:46):**  the time and resources that are required to treat lame sheep.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:50):**  You say it's a cost to farmers, but my experience living in the west of Scotland in particular  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:55):**  is that lameness just seemed to be one of those things that a lot of farmers just didn't  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:59):**  do an awful lot about.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:00):**  Yeah, I think that's true to some extent. And you do see quite high levels of lameness  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:05):**  in some sheep flocks. But that doesn't necessarily mean that farmers aren't trying to deal with  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:09):**  it. Even if you've got high levels of lameness, that can still mean a lot of time and energy  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:16):**  catching and treating lame sheep, but without an awful big effect on the levels of lameness  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:21):**  in a flock. So just because you see a lot of lame sheep, it doesn't necessarily mean  
**[0:03:25-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:25):**  that the farmer's not trying pretty hard to deal with it.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:28):**  It's interesting that you say that. And I remember conversations with the Scottish SPCA  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:33):**  and even the SSPCA officers saying, well, it's just one of those things sheep get lame.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:38):**  Yeah, that's true. And I think we have had a long history of lameness in this country  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:45):**  without practical solutions to really deal with it. And in that scenario, you have some  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:49):**  sympathy with farmers and you can understand how it's possible to become almost habituated  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:55):**  to seeing lame sheep in fields or even in your own flock. But without a practical plan  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:01):**  to deal with it, it's pretty difficult to get on top of it.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:05):**  So I'd have thought that farmers listening to this, particularly if they're having challenges  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:08):**  around lameness, will be all ears wanting to know what some of these solutions are.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:13):**  But just before we get into that, let's just think about the causes of lameness and the  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:18):**  different diseases that we're thinking of when we talk about sheep lameness.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:22):**  Yes, well, we're talking about lameness here generally, and that would be the symptom,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:28):**  the presentation that you see. But the majority of lameness are due to infectious causes,  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:34):**  largely bacterial causes, and particularly high up there on the list would be foot rot  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:40):**  and or scald, which are caused by the same bacteria. But also more recently, an emerging  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:45):**  disease called CODD, which has become more prevalent in recent years. And I think it's  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:51):**  fair to say that certainly until recently, the vast majority of sheep flocks would have  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:57):**  some level of foot rot and or scald, and some would also have CODD. So pretty widespread,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:04):**  hence the endemic nature of the disease.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:07):**  And when we're talking about a bacterial infection, it's an infection, correct me if I'm wrong,  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:12):**  that's put onto the land and it can be passed simply from sheep walking on that same land.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:18):**  It's passed sort of sheep to sheep in that way.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:20):**  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. And the important thing about this disease is that  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:24):**  it's actually spread sheep to sheep. So the sheep harbour this disease and they spread  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:30):**  it via the ground surface. And that's how other sheep pick it up. And that's one of  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:35):**  the reasons this has been so difficult to deal with over the last 30 plus years is that  
**[0:05:40-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:40):**  we have a big reservoir of potentially infected individuals and it spreads via the ground  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:46):**  surface, it can survive on the ground surface for maybe up to around 10 days for another  
**[0:05:51-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:51):**  sheep to pick it up and then that sheep gets infected. So yeah, pretty difficult to deal  
**[0:05:56-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:56):**  with.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:57):**  And so traditionally, what would farmers do to try and eradicate this or to try and manage  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:03):**  these diseases?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:04):**  Yeah, so until the emergence of the five point plan, largely the control measures were based  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:10):**  around spotting and treating individual lame animals. And that was largely with either  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:15):**  a topical or an injectable antibiotic. But really challenging, although you can have  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:20):**  a positive impact on the lameness levels in an individual using that sort of strategy,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:26):**  it's actually pretty difficult to affect the sort of population level of lameness by using  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:32):**  that that measure alone. Hence why we have these grumbling endemic problems with foot  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:37):**  rot and scald in the UK.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:39):**  And that must be pretty expensive. I mean, presumably a lot of farmers will do the injections  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:42):**  themselves, but even those will have, you know, costs associated with them.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:46):**  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, anyone who's who's handled sheep will know that that catching  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:51):**  individual sheep is really time consuming and tricky. And then if you have to gather  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:55):**  them to catch lame individuals, that's also challenging. But yes, you're right. Also,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:02):**  long term use of antibiotics is not a good thing. And more recently, with our focus on  
**[0:07:07-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:07):**  trying to reduce antibiotic levels across all animal species means that we really needed  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:13):**  to develop a different approach rather than relying on long term use of antibiotics to  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:18):**  control the disease.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:20):**  So is that why this is such a tough nut to crack? Because there are a number of different  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:25):**  diseases that that create lameness that the disease is is lying on the land. I mean, how  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:31):**  long does it lie on the land for before it dies?  
**[0:07:34-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:34):**  You're right, that there's a reasonably a really high level of lameness across the sheep  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:38):**  flock in the population across the UK means that you've got this this population of potentially  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:44):**  infected individuals on an individual farm, plus also this spreading by the ground surface,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:50):**  which you know, the bacteria can survive on pasture or in housing for for upwards of around  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:55):**  10 days. So you've got this scenario, we've got red, readily transmissible infection within  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:00):**  a farm, but also in the UK, there's a significant amount of sheep movement between farms. And  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:06):**  this gives a route of transmission, not just within an individual farm, but between farms  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:11):**  themselves.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:12):**  So farmers that are buying new sheep might well be buying in the disease that causes  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:16):**  the lameness that comes with those sheep and spreading it further, there's a new genetic  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:21):**  source of this disease coming into the farm.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:25):**  Yes, absolutely. You're right. And in fact, the bacteria that causes foot rot, there are  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:29):**  several different strains of that bacteria. So yes, it's entirely possible that that new  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:35):**  strains that haven't been seen before individual farms could be brought in, but also to CODD  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:42):**  reporting between farms. So all in all, we have an infectious disease, which has proved  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:46):**  difficult to break the transmission pathways, and has been costly on many farms.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:51):**  So it's fair to say that there are lots of different factors that lead to lameness and  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:56):**  the different diseases that cause lameness and cause that pain amongst the sheep flock.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:01):**  So it's, it's kind of, it's easy to see why farmers and vets might consider this disease  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:05):**  endemic. And I guess that brings us directly to the five point plan, which is a way of  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:11):**  managing lameness of managing these diseases, of reducing it exponentially on farms. So  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:17):**  how did it come about? And perhaps you could give us a really quick summary of what the  
**[0:09:22-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:22):**  five point plan is before we go into it in detail.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:25):**  Yeah, absolutely. So, well, you're right, the five point plan came about really through  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:29):**  our frustrations with dealing with high levels of lameness in our own flock. But we also  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:33):**  went out and sought out some some knowledge from farmers who had had some success in dealing  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:39):**  with lameness to see if there were any common threads between what they were doing. And  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:43):**  we soon realized that actually, in order to tackle this disease, we'd need to sort of  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:46):**  forget about single magic bullets, but rather focus on a practical and more holistic approach,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:52):**  which could be adapted to many farming systems. And that's how we came about the five point  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:58):**  plan really, it was an accumulation of our ideas, the evidence and the science out there,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:04):**  but also equally the experiences of farmers who had had success with dealing with lameness.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:09):**  And it was the common threads that led us to develop the five elements of the five point  
**[0:10:14-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:14):**  plan. So the five point plan in brief has five action points which go contribute towards  
**[0:10:20-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:20):**  supporting the animal in three different ways. So the first is all about building resilience.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:27):**  That's about culling out the worst offenders, those with chronically misshapen or infected  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:31):**  feet, or inability to tackle this disease themselves. So creating a population of more  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:38):**  resilient individuals. Secondly, it's about establishing some immunity. Without going  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:44):**  into too much details, it's about using a vaccination to establish a level of population  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:48):**  immunity within the flock. And then the third way is all about reducing disease challenge.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:54):**  So the level of disease on the farm, and there are three action points associated with that.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:59):**  So it's about avoiding spreading the disease, as we've described, it's spread by the ground  
**[0:11:03-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:03):**  surface. So it's trying to break some of those transmission points. It's about rapid treatment  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:09):**  of clinical cases on the basis that they are a source of infection to other animals. And  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:14):**  importantly, it's about bringing in an element of quarantine, which we're all pretty familiar  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:18):**  with at this moment in time, so that we can reduce the possibility of spreading the disease  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:24):**  from another flock.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:25):**  Interesting. Okay, so Claire, coming back to you, you've been using the five point plan,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:31):**  you said you've used it both on the FAI farm and on your own farm. Has it been successful?  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:36):**  Yes, yes, it has. And it takes it takes some getting your head round to start with, because  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:41):**  it's a totally different way of management. And I would say we made mistakes in the early  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:46):**  days where we just focused on the individual treatment bit, we kind of just thought, right,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:52):**  we need to start individually treating and we got our heads around how we would do that.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:55):**  And that's what we did. And we ended up doing that for a long time with without putting  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:59):**  some of the other things in place. So it didn't work to start with. And, and we were really  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:03):**  frustrated. But then I kind of sat down and relooked at it and, and realised that we were  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:09):**  missing some of the other elements. So one example, on where we are with a 10 days thing  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:16):**  we find really useful. So we've made sure that all of our sheep move every field, move  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:20):**  from a field to another one at least every 10 days. And they would never go back in into  
**[0:12:24-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:24):**  something for more than 10 days after that, so that we plan. Yeah, five point planning  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:31):**  becomes part of our grazing, grazing planning.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:33):**  So if you've just got, you know, sheep that are up on a hillside or a mountain and, and  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:40):**  and they're roaming as they choose to, then that's going to make it very difficult to  
**[0:12:45-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:45):**  implement this plan?  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:47):**  Well, it's, it's a case of, I think, Ruth used the words adaptive and the point about  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:52):**  the plan is that it's, it's principles rather than prescriptions or rules. So if you the  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:57):**  point is that you consider all of the five points within the plan, and you think about  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:02):**  how they are relevant to your farm. So, you know, for us on lowland rich, Oxfordshire  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:08):**  ground, and we are able to achieve that. And that's a really important part for us because  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:12):**  we're fairly heavily stocked with in the way that we have, you know, sheep constantly moving  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:17):**  around an area whereas on hills, you'll be much more extensively stocked. So that won't  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:22):**  that won't be possible. But as long as you're looking at the other areas of the plan, and  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:28):**  making sure that everything is is you're doing as much as you can against it, then it's still  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:33):**  achievable yet everybody making their own plan for their own farm.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:38):**  And in that way, I suppose the impression I'm getting with you know, these five points  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:42):**  that that you outlined, Ruth, that it's not about approaching them in a linear fashion,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:48):**  there isn't a sort of a story, you do this first, followed by that followed by that.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:52):**  It's about trying to do all of the things at the same time and find the best way of  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:56):**  approaching it.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah, no, I thought you're absolutely right that the five point plan is it is a framework.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:02):**  And every farmer will have various different elements that they're already doing pretty  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:06):**  much nobody is starting from a position where they're not doing any of the elements of the  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:10):**  five point plan to try and control lameness at that the starting point. So the job is  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:14):**  to identify which elements of the plan are missing on an individual farm and would enable  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:20):**  you to tip the balance across from a grumbling sort of endemic lameness situation to it to  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:25):**  a situation where you really have this under control. And the key point is that this is  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:30):**  a five point plan, and attention needs to be given to all five points of the plan. So  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:37):**  you just need to look and see where the gaps are really so and identify those gaps to ensure  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:43):**  that you're covering all of the bases.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:45):**  And I guess that that's that that approach is important, not only for diseases relating  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:51):**  to lameness, but actually for other diseases as well. Like, you know, I was mentioning  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:54):**  Western Scotland where I used to live. And I remember having a conversation with a farmer  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:57):**  up there where he was really frustrated about liver fluke because, you know, he was saying  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:01):**  that he had treated his flock five times that year to try and eradicate the fluke. But of  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:06):**  course, you know, he was focusing, I guess, all of his attention on that treatment element  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:11):**  rather than necessarily recognising the importance of some of these other factors.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:15):**  Yeah, absolutely. And I think what's interesting is although we started looking at this approach,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:22):**  obviously trying to tackle lameness and specifically foot rot and scold, actually the approach  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:28):**  that we're using, this more holistic approach is really applicable to all sorts of other  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:32):**  disease scenarios where actually perhaps we don't have a magic bullet, one thing that  
**[0:15:37-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:37):**  we can throw at the disease that's going to fix it. But actually, we have to do multiple  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:41):**  elements. And as Claire said, actually, that that is more difficult to roll out, it's more  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:47):**  difficult to communicate with farmers. But I think we need to get better at doing this  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:51):**  because that this isn't the only disease where this kind of approach could be really beneficial.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:57):**  So Claire, you said that you've been you've been using this yourself with, you know, initially  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:02):**  with less success than you hoped for, but ultimately, it started working really well.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:06):**  I wonder if you could tell me a couple of things. The first of all, how long how long  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:10):**  you've been working with the five point plan. And secondly, the Farm Animal Welfare Council,  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:15):**  of course, wants lameness to reduce down to 2% by 2021. We're nearly there. It's 2020.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:22):**  Do you think that you're on track with the flocks that you manage?  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:25):**  Yes, we started using it in 2012 when when we got our sheep flock, and I would say, how  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:31):**  long did it take to become effective? It took as long as for me to sit down and look at  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:36):**  the plan properly, and not just think it was all about individual treatment. So as soon  
**[0:16:40-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:40):**  as I sat down and looked at the plan, we were culling as well, actually, we you know, we  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:44):**  were culling. And that was hard to start with getting our head around culling for feet,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:50):**  you know, not the really the more obvious things and we have a depending on where we  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:54):**  are on sheep numbers, a two or three strikes and you're out when it comes to and when it  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:59):**  comes to lameness. And so it took to having to catch and treat an individual animal more  
**[0:17:04-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:04):**  than two or three times would render it for the cull pile at the next available opportunity  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:08):**  at whether that be weaning or scanning or something. And we do that now with more technology,  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:15):**  farm technology systems, but we also still do adopt on the shoulder of the lame leg,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:21):**  which means that other people working around the farm can see whether animals have been  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:24):**  treated or not. But it also obviously lose that information at shearing when the animal  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:28):**  gets sheared. But it's quite a good indicator when you see a lame animal to see, okay, she's  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:32):**  been treated a few times before really easily without having to look it up on the system.  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:36):**  So it took us long before I actually sat down and looked at the other points in the bits  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:40):**  that we started to vaccinate. And it was the avoiding bit. So starting to think about where  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:47):**  we do have animals walking over the same ground. So maybe putting our electric fences up slightly  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:52):**  differently, closing or fixing gates, we had broken gates, so we would have a gate open  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:56):**  between two fields. So of course, all the animals are channeling backwards and forwards  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:00):**  through it, making sure we if we do have lick buckets, or if we do have movable water troughs  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:06):**  or anything where animals are congregating, moving those on every day, so that it just  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:11):**  minimises the infection, the infection rate, because I think that's the bit as soon as  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:16):**  you if you look in a field of sheep, and you'll see they follow tracks, and they all follow  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:21):**  each other. And when you've got a ewe, you've got her lambs following behind. And that's  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:25):**  when it gets really hard when lambs start picking up scold, and they're all chasing  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:29):**  each other around. So they're all just picking it up from each other. So it was making some  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:32):**  practical changes. And basically, that was it looking at the whole plan. And then and  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:37):**  then we started to see the results. And that was great. And are we on track for the FAWC  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:42):**  targets? I would say that yes, we are now we do if the weather goes bad, or they've  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:47):**  been in a field with maybe really some long grass, and we will see a spike. But what we  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:52):**  do, which is a recommendation within the five point plan that we didn't do originally, but  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:57):**  is a really useful tool, I think is like a regular lameness score. So possibly even sometimes  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:03):**  our stock manager for sheep would do it, but actually, sometimes with someone else on the  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:07):**  farm will do it where you go out, rather than doing it as part of sheep checks, or as part  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:11):**  of another job, actually, stop, stand back and go out and just look for lameness. So  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:14):**  kind of look across the field, and you count the number that you know, see lame, and there's  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:18):**  some certain parameters, however you want to do it. And then actually look at that number.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:22):**  And then that gives you a really good sense of what your percentage lameness is at any  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:26):**  one time on the farm. And we do that two or three times a year at set times. And so it's  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:31):**  a really good indicator for ourselves. It's not the only thing we do, but it just it helps  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:36):**  us see whether we're overall on track for that. And mostly we sit at 2%, 2% or below.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:43):**  And sometimes we do have spikes. But in the main when we get a spike, we write, okay,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:48):**  all action, what are we going to do to bring it back down? Because we know that if we let  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:52):**  that creep up, it just ends up with everybody, well, not everybody, but people spending hours  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:57):**  doing treatments.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:58):**  And so if you if you were at 2% ish now, then when you sort of came in at 2012, and started  
**[0:20:05-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:05):**  working with it, what do you think your percentage would have been about then just to give people  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:08):**  an idea of where you've come from and got to  
**[0:20:11-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:11):**  Oh, at times we would have would have been at 10%. But I've worked on other farms where  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:18):**  it's been, you know, it's been much, much higher than that.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:22):**  Yeah. And certainly I've seen farms where you're up to a third or even half of sheep  
**[0:20:27-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:27):**  displaying some level of lameness.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:29):**  My friend Alice has a good saying was when the bad becomes the norm, and she used that  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:32):**  referring to dairy cow lameness is that people just get people just get so used to seeing  
**[0:20:37-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:37):**  it. It's not it's not regarded as a problem. And it's the solutions haven't always been  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:43):**  there or they're difficult to implement. And it is hard. And the practicalities around  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:49):**  individual treatments or individual catching, if you don't have, you know, a really a super  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:54):**  dog, then you're having to gather them in order to catch them. And then you have this  
**[0:20:58-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:58):**  balance of where we gather them, we bring them all together, and we've got lots of cross  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:01):**  contamination. And you know, so just sort of having to think about what how do we balance  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:07):**  that and how do we tackle it in the right way? And it certainly hurt my head. Others  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:12):**  might find it easier. But for me, I was like, I just don't know what to do for the best.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:15):**  It's difficult.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:16):**  And I think Claire, you know, really well demonstrates the challenges that can be faced,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:23):**  particularly actually at the beginning when you're trying to get the five point plan implemented  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:28):**  and get your lameness levels under control. It's it can be really challenging. So quite  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:33):**  often there's a there's at least a sort of six month period when you really have to weather  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:38):**  the storm a bit in order to try and get under control and probably put more effort in than  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:43):**  you would like to do to try and bring it under control. But just in the in the knowledge  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:48):**  that actually if you can do that, you can flip this from being a constant sort of process  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:53):**  of treating lame animals into a truly preventative approach, then then you will reap the rewards  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:59):**  at a later time. And that's really something important to keep in mind that the whole purpose  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:05):**  of this is to try and transform the management into a preventative strategy rather than a  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:10):**  sort of firefighting one.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:12):**  Fantastic. So I think we've been teasing people enough. We talked about it. We've talked about  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:16):**  the fact that it's successful. We've mentioned the headlines. Let's get into the full movie  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:20):**  now. And so I wonder if we could go into the five point plan, you know, kind of point by  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:25):**  point and just go into it in a bit more detail. Where would you like to start, Ruth?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:30):**  Tricky to know where to start, because as I said, different farms will need to focus  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:33):**  on different elements depending on what they're doing. But anyway, let's start at the top,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:39):**  as it were. And the first point I usually mention is, is culling out the worst offenders.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:45):**  Most farms will have a small population of sheep, as Claire very eloquently described,  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:51):**  of repeat offenders, animals who've been laying before. Maybe they've got chronically damaged  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:55):**  feet. They're more likely to pick up the infection again. And and they are constant sources of  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:01):**  infection. It's not uncommon to hear farmers saying, oh, but, you know, they had twins,  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:05):**  they had triplets, they're good producers. But actually, the reality is that these animals  
**[0:23:09-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:09):**  are costing money and resources. And it really would be beneficial for the whole flock to  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:17):**  cull that population out, leaving you with a more resilient population as a starting  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:22):**  point. So, you know, a great place to start with with the plan is it is at culling time,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:27):**  you've got an opportunity to try and get in control in your ewe flock, within the knowledge  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:32):**  that it's the ewe flock that spread this disease to the next crop of lambs, you know, this  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:36):**  this bacteria, although it's prevalent, it's on the pasture for small amounts of time,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:40):**  it's not primarily living on the pasture, it's living in the sheep. So that's the first  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:45):**  point, culling out your very worst offenders. And then moving on round the five point plan  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:50):**  diagram, the next point, and in fact, the next three points are all about trying to  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:55):**  say, well, you know, that this this disease is spread animal to animal via the floor surface.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:01):**  So how do we reduce the level of disease? How do we reduce those transmissions hotspots?  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:06):**  The first point there is all about avoiding that transmission, as Claire described some  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:11):**  some useful pointers there. So, you know, any any areas of high congregation of animals,  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:17):**  water troughs, feed troughs, mineral buckets, gateways, trying to address those potentially  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:24):**  using lime in areas that can't be moved or moving things that can be moved, shutting  
**[0:24:30-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:30):**  gateways, but also thinking about how that could be transmitted during handling and trying  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:34):**  to improve the ground surface there.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:36):**  And we've talked about the, you know, the the fact that it exists for up to 10 days  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:41):**  on the ground. How long does it actually exist in the sheep themselves? And can it can the  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:45):**  diseases be latent and sort of re-emerge?  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:48):**  Yeah, there is some evidence that it that it can be particularly in these animals who've  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:53):**  got chronically damaged feet, that it could be grumbling in there, you know, for long,  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:57):**  much longer periods of time. But effectively, it's it's there on the sheep's foot for as  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:01):**  long as it's an active infection. But yeah, that is possible that it that particular animals  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:07):**  in it could be harbouring the disease.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:09):**  So again, culling, you know, is important from that perspective as well. And I wonder  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:12):**  as well, because we touched on this earlier, but how effective the plan is in different  
**[0:25:17-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:17):**  landscapes. And obviously, what Claire was talking about in terms of being able to move  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:21):**  her flock from this field, you know, to another field, and then not bringing them back into  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:27):**  the same field, you know, for 10 days, etc. That that is much harder on hill land or on  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:31):**  the mountainside. So how would how would how would you expect farmers or have you got experience  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:37):**  of farmers trying to manage that in hill land?  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:39):**  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's almost every farm brings its own challenges in some respects  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:45):**  and where you have more extensive grazing scenarios, then then yes, you have less opportunities  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:51):**  to perhaps tackle some of the individual hotspots that we've just described. Largely, the animals  
**[0:25:56-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:56):**  tend to be more spread out with a reduced stocking density, which can be beneficial.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:03):**  But you can also have co grazing. So that means collaborating with neighbours to try  
**[0:26:08-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:08):**  and get on top of this, you know, as a region. So, yeah, every farm has its challenges. And  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:14):**  it really is about looking at the framework and saying, Okay, you know, what, where are  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:18):**  the areas that potentially this disease could be spread on my farm in my setting, and trying  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:23):**  to look long and hard at how you can address some of them. And some of them are really  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:27):**  difficult and you just can't address. So you have to accept some of those and work on the  
**[0:26:31-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:31):**  bits that you can  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:32):**  and presumably involving your vet wherever possible in in kind of making some of those  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:36):**  decisions. So sort of farmers and vets working together, I know that, you know, some vets,  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:40):**  particularly the old school are more reluctant to kind of give land management advice advice  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:45):**  about things that aren't directly linked to, to giving medicines.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah, I think you're right. But but what's encouraging is that the veterinary community  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:54):**  have been really supportive of this kind of approach. And I think there is a growing acknowledgement  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:59):**  that that actually, as vets, we need to be more experts in these sort of holistic approaches,  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:04):**  which include things like grazing management, husbandry, biosecurity, and all of those elements.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:10):**  So I think, you know, the majority of vets, particularly sheep vets should be able to  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:15):**  help really constructively with looking practically on a farm at how this framework applies in  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:22):**  different settings, and giving some good practical and actionable advice about how to how to  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:28):**  implement.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:29):**  Okay, so we've had culling, which helps to build resilience, we've moved into that reducing  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:33):**  the disease challenge, sort of section with we've talked about avoidance, should we go  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:38):**  on to treating?  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:39):**  Yeah, relatively simple in some respects, although as Claire says, not easy to do with  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:45):**  individuals, but this is about acknowledging that that, you know, a lame animal with a  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:50):**  bacterial foot condition will be potentially spreading that disease to other animals, other  
**[0:27:55-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:55):**  ewes, other lambs. And when you get outbreaks of scald, that is coming from ewes with foot  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:03):**  rot or scald. So it's about identifying those animals and treating them as rapidly as possible,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:08):**  easier said than done. I absolutely know from bitter experience, but it's about doing the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:12):**  best you can here in the knowledge that actually, if you get this right, you're going to have  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:16):**  a lot fewer of these in the future to deal with. It starts coming down to the odd one  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:22):**  rather than, you know, lame animals in every field, which is much more manageable than  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:27):**  a scenario where you're looking at sort of, as you say, five, 10, up to half animals lame  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:32):**  in fields that that's really challenging, but also getting the right treatment for the  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:38):**  right disease. So this is about understanding the correct diagnosis. So again, working with  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:42):**  your vet here is important. Are you primarily looking at foot rot? Do you have some CODD  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:47):**  in there? So you're getting the right antibiotics to treat at the right time. But ultimately  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:53):**  looking to reduce this, really what we want to do is we want to do a good job here, such  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:56):**  that we're doing less of this in the future.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:58):**  Brilliant. And so we're foot rot, we're talking about octa tetracycline presumably is the  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:03):**  main one as opposed to CODD with amoxicillin and those medicines are doing different things.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:09):**  So if you diagnose it wrong, the medicines aren't going to work.  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:13):**  Yeah, absolutely. Getting the right diagnosis will allow you to administer the correct treatment,  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:18):**  obviously the correct dose. And if you're able to treat those animals as rapidly as  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:23):**  possible, you're treating them at the right time. So it's really about targeting that  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:28):**  treatment. And as I say that the critical thing here is, you know, if we do a good job  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:32):**  on the whole plan, this is what we want to be doing less of in the future.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:35):**  So moving on to quarantine.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:37):**  Yeah, this is really important. So two elements to this. This is about quarantining on farm.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:44):**  So for instance, if you do have lame animals, particularly at the beginning of the plan,  
**[0:29:48-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:48):**  when you're trying to get on top of things, you know, one idea would be to separate those  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:52):**  animals and you know, have a lame field where you can deal with those animals separately,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:57):**  if possible, or if you're housing them have a pen where you've got animals that you're  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:02):**  struggling to control the lameness levels in. This might include some of those, those  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:06):**  chronic feet before you're able to cull them. But also importantly, if you're bringing animals  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:10):**  onto the farm, you really need to have a robust quarantine procedure in place so that you're  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:14):**  keeping them separate. You're protecting the incoming animals, but you're also protecting  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:18):**  your existing flock from either different strains of the foot rot bacteria or from CODD.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:24):**  And how long are those quarantines going to last? Are they the kind of 10 days that we've  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:27):**  been talking about?  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:28):**  Well, a little bit longer really. This is particularly, it's important for foot rot,  
**[0:30:34-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:34):**  and you want to be able to nail those animals and treat them as quickly as possible if they  
**[0:30:37-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:37):**  do come in with any signs of lameness. But with CODD, you can have lesions, CODD lesions  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:44):**  before the animals become lame, it tends to start higher up on the foot. So it's really  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:48):**  important to keep an eye out for those because you do not want to be bringing CODD into your  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:52):**  flock if you're not currently struggling with that.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:55):**  So that quarantine for how long? Two, three weeks?  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:58):**  Yes, we would recommend four weeks quarantine procedure. But obviously, you know, this needs  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:04):**  to be drawn up in collaboration with your vet who can help you not only for lameness,  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:08):**  there could be other reasons why you're quarantining as well. So you can tie this in with all sorts  
**[0:31:13-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:13):**  of other pathogens.  
**[0:31:14-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:14):**  So we talked about culling to build resilience. We talked about reducing the disease challenge  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:19):**  and we've looked at avoid and treat and quarantine. There's one point left in the five point plan.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:24):**  Yeah, so this is all about trying to establish some immunity, some vaccine immunity. Actually,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:30):**  the reason that the animals can become repeatedly infected is because natural immunity is relatively  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:35):**  short lived, unfortunately. And indeed, the vaccine immunity mirrors that that scenario.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:41):**  So we there is a vaccine on the market only one, it covers the majority of strains of  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:47):**  the foot rot bacteria. So it's a really useful tool. But on its own, it's it's unlikely to  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:53):**  control foot rot, but as part of the five point plan, it gives you a really useful building  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:57):**  block to try and give these animals some level of immunity while you're trying to get on  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:02):**  top of it. And some farmers also describe using the vaccine as a kind of insurance policy  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:07):**  once they have got once they've implemented the five point plan their own control, administering  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:12):**  the vaccine allows them a level of ongoing control as a kind of insurance against going  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:17):**  back down to unfavourable levels of lameness in the future.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:21):**  Fantastic. That's really helpful. So we've got culling, vaccination, quarantining, treating,  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:26):**  and avoiding all these these the five points of the plan that you've developed in Claire  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:31):**  just sort of coming back to you. I mean, you talked about the fact that you know, it was  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:34):**  it was perhaps difficult to get your head around it in the first place because, you  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:38):**  know, you're sort of trying to, you know, look at treatment or prioritise one over and  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:44):**  above the other. But once you've discovered that you need to approach all of these five  
**[0:32:47-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:47):**  elements at once, how difficult is it to implement? It sounds like it's a reasonable management  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:54):**  framework and that once you've set that management framework in place, it should be reasonably  
**[0:32:59-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:59):**  straightforward to deliver.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:00):**  Yeah, once once you get your head around it, it absolutely is. And particularly when you  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:05):**  get through that possibly painful early stage where you're learning how to do things in  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:09):**  a different way, starting to look out for different things and think about the way you're  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:13):**  managing the managing the farm in a different way. Once you've got through that, and you've  
**[0:33:17-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:17):**  got it under control. Yeah. Then suddenly lameness is like a oh, you know, it's a problem.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:23):**  But if we spot a lame sheep, we know what to do. We treat her straight away. And it  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:27):**  doesn't likely doesn't likely spread. And what's interesting now is that we get lameness,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:33):**  but it's so, you know, sheep with obviously painful feet that are limping. But often,  
**[0:33:38-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:38):**  very rarely now is it actually scald or foot rot. It's often a bit of twig stuck in it  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:45):**  or a toe that's caught and torn or, you know, it's other we're discovering all these other  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:51):**  reasons other other things that make sheep lame and which were always there, of course.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:55):**  But when foot rot and scald were so much bigger parts of what we did, we you know, we didn't  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:00):**  really see that. And often, of course, a sheep with a piece of something twig stuck between  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:04):**  her toes would would also probably have scald and foot rot or one of the other or both at  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:09):**  the same time and same time as that. So, yeah, we lameness. It's really surprising how we  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:15):**  just don't have those those problems anymore. So lameness used to be a big part of my life.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:20):**  But now it's not so much and that's great. But it does require a mindset, a mindset change.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:26):**  And of course, when you're on a larger farm like we are, it's not just me that's needed  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:29):**  to get my head around it. It's the rest of the farm team as well. And then of course,  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:33):**  that that can be challenging. But once you start to see the results, then it kind of  
**[0:34:37-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:37):**  clicks and you're like, yes, I get it and it works and I can see how it's working. And  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:41):**  then and that's great. But it's something that you just need to stay on top of. And  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:45):**  you know, at times it happens to us because of other pressures on a mixed farm. And there's  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:51):**  a few that might start to go lame. Oh, someone will say, oh, you know, we'll deal with those  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:55):**  another day. And of course, then a few more. And then we end up we're on floodplains here.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:00):**  So sometimes some fields can come in quite wet and that might be where we get a problem.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:03):**  And we might get quite a few. And then we realise that we've let it get, you know, out  
**[0:35:08-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:08):**  of control, but we just give it some focus again and get back on top of it.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:11):**  So once it's implemented, it's it's relatively straightforward to manage that it makes a  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:15):**  big difference to your life in terms of the amount of time and money that you're spending  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:18):**  on lameness related issues. But let's just think about that mindset change and those  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:25):**  first six months. And as with any management change, you can see things getting worse sometimes  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:30):**  before they get better while you're trying to implement new systems and and really, you  
**[0:35:35-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:35):**  know, get a proper full understanding of that change that you're implementing. So are there  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:40):**  any tips or suggestions that you can give to farmers or vets who are listening to this  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:45):**  and, you know, interested in taking this on and would be grateful for them?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:49):**  I'd say I don't know if it gets worse before it gets better. But what you what you often  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:54):**  don't see is results straight away. And when that happens, it's really easy to think, oh,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:59):**  this doesn't work. This isn't working. Let's stop. Stop it all and go back to what we know.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:04):**  And I think that's the key thing is to stick with it. Be patient. And also, as my experience  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:10):**  is, look at the plan. If it's not working after quite a long period of time, it's likely  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:15):**  that something in the plan is missing. And so we look at what you're doing and go through  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:20):**  it again. And there are some useful tools available online to, you know, to give you  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:27):**  some guidance about what to look for and download some of those and just go through it with  
**[0:36:31-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:31):**  a fine tooth comb.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:32):**  So just finally, let's just think about the costs. And I wonder if there's anything that  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:37):**  we've learned about the cost of dealing with lameness and how that's changed as a result  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:43):**  of using the five point plan.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:45):**  Yeah, well, actually, what we do know is that we don't have great data on levels of lameness  
**[0:36:49-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:49):**  across the UK. But what we do know is on individual farms, if you had an average prevalence of  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:56):**  around 10 percent, then there is a really good cost calculator produced by Reading University  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:03):**  that estimates that would be costing you about eight pounds fifty five per year in the flock  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:08):**  per year. So for every year you've got in the flock, that's eight pounds fifty five  
**[0:37:12-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:12):**  at a level of 10 percent. So that's a significant cost. And that would be made up of direct  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:18):**  costs. So the actual cost of treating those ewes with antibiotics, but also those hidden  
**[0:37:23-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:23):**  costs of a loss of productivity.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:26):**  And so presumably, if you can bring those costs down in any way at all with a different  
**[0:37:32-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:32):**  management regime, that's got to be beneficial for your system.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:36):**  Yeah. So, I mean, the only element within here that requires an additional direct cost  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:42):**  would be the vaccine, which roughly costs about two pounds per year and initially some  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:48):**  increased time in terms of pulling the plan together, trying to put in some extra effort  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:52):**  to identify those hotspots for disease transmission. But ultimately, you're trying to reduce the  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:58):**  time, the lost productivity and also the cost of treatments, such that that becomes a much  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:04):**  lower level. So, you know, if you're looking at a cost of eight pounds fifty five per year,  
**[0:38:09-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:09):**  but you're looking to reduce that enormously and perhaps replacing that with a cost of  
**[0:38:15-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:15):**  two pounds for the vaccine, you really should be looking at a significant reduction in the  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:19):**  costs of managing lameness over time.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:21):**  Thanks very much, both of you. I think it's been really interesting hearing about the  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:26):**  plan and about the way that the different elements work together. And I wonder if either  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:31):**  of you have a sense, you know, since the plan was first put together and I think, Ruth,  
**[0:38:36-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:36):**  it was you that developed it in the first place. Do you have any sense of what the take-up  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:41):**  has been like across the nation, whether this is used by, you know, what percentage of sheep  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:48):**  farmers and shepherds are using this?  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:50):**  Yeah, really hard to say. We know that it's quite well known. We know that quite a good  
**[0:38:55-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:55):**  population of sheep focused vets are using and recommending the plan. And various anecdotal  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:02):**  reports tell us that a significant number of farmers have been using it. And there is  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:07):**  also evidence that that lameness levels are coming down and in particular may have hit  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:13):**  the forked target of less than five percent by 2016. So we know that it's out there, it's  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:18):**  being used. I still think there's more to be done. There's more farmers that could be  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:22):**  helped, but I still think there's a way to go to where we're really truly in control  
**[0:39:26-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:26):**  of this disease.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:28):**  And if vets and farmers want to find out more about the Five Point Plan and about how to  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:33):**  use it for themselves, where can they go? Where's the best place to start looking?  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:37):**  Yeah, there's quite a lot of resources out there. One thing that we have managed to achieve  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:41):**  with the Five Point Plan is a consensus that this will be the national approach to dealing  
**[0:39:46-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:46):**  with this disease. And so we've tried to harmonise the message and the communications for vets  
**[0:39:52-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:52):**  and farmers to try and add that level of consistency into dealing with this disease. So you can  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:00):**  find resources on the FAI website. You will also be able to find information from individual  
**[0:40:05-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:05):**  veterinary surgeons, particularly those focused on sheep. And a quick Google will also give  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:10):**  you all sorts of resources from a lot of the sheep organisations in the UK detailing the  
**[0:40:15-0:40:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:15):**  Five Point Plan and how you can go about starting to use it.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:19):**  Well, thank you very much. I mean, that's all we've got time for. And I found that really  
**[0:40:24-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:24):**  fascinating. It's a really interesting conversation. And thank you both for your contribution.  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:30):**  So I'd like to thank my guests, Ruth Clements from Benchmark Animal Health and Claire Hill

### Farm Gate  (2020-27-20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. There are conditions so prevalent  on farms that they are regarded by many as just simply endemic, ever-present, regardless  of the efforts made to curb new infections. Sheep lameness is one of these conditions.  But is lameness endemic? Can more effective monitoring and treatment effectively eradicate  it from flocks? I'm joined by Ruth Clements, the head of veterinary programs from Benchmark  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:31):**  Animal Health, and by Claire Hill, the farm manager from FAI Farms. Hello both.  Hello.  Maybe you could just introduce yourselves and tell us what your link is with sheep and  lameness more generally.  Yes, hi, I'm Ruth Clements. Long history with dealing with lameness, both practically  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:00:50):**  and in a flock that I helped to manage, but also researching into lameness, and particularly  looking at practical actionable solutions that could be shared with the wider farming  community. And yeah, particular interest in endemic disease and trying to find some solutions  to some of these really difficult diseases.  And obviously, we're going to be talking about the five point plan. That's the purpose of  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:14):**  this podcast. And this is something that you've been working on developing over the course  of many years and which has been implemented fairly successfully, I think, on many farms  now. And Claire, you're the farm manager at FAI, you've had some experience of implementing  the five point plan.  Yeah, that's right. I have both here at FAI Farms and also in my own flock of sheep, which  
**[0:01:36-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:01:36):**  started in 2012. And which has given me an interesting angle because I've come into a  flock here, which was already using five point plan, and I started it from a maybe a higher  place of lameness with my own flock.  Fantastic. So before we go into the details of the plan and what that is and how it can  help farmers and vets to reduce lameness in flocks, maybe we could just start with talking  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:02):**  about lameness more generally. I mean, what causes it and why is it a problem?  Yeah, well, I mean, a sheep shows lameness primarily in response to pain, as you described  earlier. And as such, this does represent a welfare problem for that individual animal.  But in addition, a lame sheep is less likely to be eating as much, which can lead to lost  productivity for the farmers, both in terms of ewes, milking ability and also lamb growth.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:29):**  And so the disease is a sustainability blocker in many ways, but also it can leave them more  susceptible to other diseases such as fly strike. But to add to the above, it's the  big economic cost to farmers. Sheep that are not as productive are costly, together with  the time and resources that are required to treat lame sheep.  You say it's a cost to farmers, but my experience living in the west of Scotland in particular  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:02:55):**  is that lameness just seemed to be one of those things that a lot of farmers just didn't  do an awful lot about.  Yeah, I think that's true to some extent. And you do see quite high levels of lameness  in some sheep flocks. But that doesn't necessarily mean that farmers aren't trying to deal with  it. Even if you've got high levels of lameness, that can still mean a lot of time and energy  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:16):**  catching and treating lame sheep, but without an awful big effect on the levels of lameness  in a flock. So just because you see a lot of lame sheep, it doesn't necessarily mean  that the farmer's not trying pretty hard to deal with it.  It's interesting that you say that. And I remember conversations with the Scottish SPCA  and even the SSPCA officers saying, well, it's just one of those things sheep get lame.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:03:38):**  Yeah, that's true. And I think we have had a long history of lameness in this country  without practical solutions to really deal with it. And in that scenario, you have some  sympathy with farmers and you can understand how it's possible to become almost habituated  to seeing lame sheep in fields or even in your own flock. But without a practical plan  to deal with it, it's pretty difficult to get on top of it.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:05):**  So I'd have thought that farmers listening to this, particularly if they're having challenges  around lameness, will be all ears wanting to know what some of these solutions are.  But just before we get into that, let's just think about the causes of lameness and the  different diseases that we're thinking of when we talk about sheep lameness.  Yes, well, we're talking about lameness here generally, and that would be the symptom,  
**[0:04:28-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:28):**  the presentation that you see. But the majority of lameness are due to infectious causes,  largely bacterial causes, and particularly high up there on the list would be foot rot  and or scald, which are caused by the same bacteria. But also more recently, an emerging  disease called CODD, which has become more prevalent in recent years. And I think it's  fair to say that certainly until recently, the vast majority of sheep flocks would have  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:04:57):**  some level of foot rot and or scald, and some would also have CODD. So pretty widespread,  hence the endemic nature of the disease.  And when we're talking about a bacterial infection, it's an infection, correct me if I'm wrong,  that's put onto the land and it can be passed simply from sheep walking on that same land.  It's passed sort of sheep to sheep in that way.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:20):**  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. And the important thing about this disease is that  it's actually spread sheep to sheep. So the sheep harbour this disease and they spread  it via the ground surface. And that's how other sheep pick it up. And that's one of  the reasons this has been so difficult to deal with over the last 30 plus years is that  we have a big reservoir of potentially infected individuals and it spreads via the ground  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:05:46):**  surface, it can survive on the ground surface for maybe up to around 10 days for another  sheep to pick it up and then that sheep gets infected. So yeah, pretty difficult to deal  with.  And so traditionally, what would farmers do to try and eradicate this or to try and manage  these diseases?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:04):**  Yeah, so until the emergence of the five point plan, largely the control measures were based  around spotting and treating individual lame animals. And that was largely with either  a topical or an injectable antibiotic. But really challenging, although you can have  a positive impact on the lameness levels in an individual using that sort of strategy,  it's actually pretty difficult to affect the sort of population level of lameness by using  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:32):**  that that measure alone. Hence why we have these grumbling endemic problems with foot  rot and scald in the UK.  And that must be pretty expensive. I mean, presumably a lot of farmers will do the injections  themselves, but even those will have, you know, costs associated with them.  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, anyone who's who's handled sheep will know that that catching  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:06:51):**  individual sheep is really time consuming and tricky. And then if you have to gather  them to catch lame individuals, that's also challenging. But yes, you're right. Also,  long term use of antibiotics is not a good thing. And more recently, with our focus on  trying to reduce antibiotic levels across all animal species means that we really needed  to develop a different approach rather than relying on long term use of antibiotics to  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:18):**  control the disease.  So is that why this is such a tough nut to crack? Because there are a number of different  diseases that that create lameness that the disease is is lying on the land. I mean, how  long does it lie on the land for before it dies?  You're right, that there's a reasonably a really high level of lameness across the sheep  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:07:38):**  flock in the population across the UK means that you've got this this population of potentially  infected individuals on an individual farm, plus also this spreading by the ground surface,  which you know, the bacteria can survive on pasture or in housing for for upwards of around  10 days. So you've got this scenario, we've got red, readily transmissible infection within  a farm, but also in the UK, there's a significant amount of sheep movement between farms. And  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:06):**  this gives a route of transmission, not just within an individual farm, but between farms  themselves.  So farmers that are buying new sheep might well be buying in the disease that causes  the lameness that comes with those sheep and spreading it further, there's a new genetic  source of this disease coming into the farm.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:25):**  Yes, absolutely. You're right. And in fact, the bacteria that causes foot rot, there are  several different strains of that bacteria. So yes, it's entirely possible that that new  strains that haven't been seen before individual farms could be brought in, but also to CODD  reporting between farms. So all in all, we have an infectious disease, which has proved  difficult to break the transmission pathways, and has been costly on many farms.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:08:51):**  So it's fair to say that there are lots of different factors that lead to lameness and  the different diseases that cause lameness and cause that pain amongst the sheep flock.  So it's, it's kind of, it's easy to see why farmers and vets might consider this disease  endemic. And I guess that brings us directly to the five point plan, which is a way of  managing lameness of managing these diseases, of reducing it exponentially on farms. So  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:17):**  how did it come about? And perhaps you could give us a really quick summary of what the  five point plan is before we go into it in detail.  Yeah, absolutely. So, well, you're right, the five point plan came about really through  our frustrations with dealing with high levels of lameness in our own flock. But we also  went out and sought out some some knowledge from farmers who had had some success in dealing  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:09:39):**  with lameness to see if there were any common threads between what they were doing. And  we soon realized that actually, in order to tackle this disease, we'd need to sort of  forget about single magic bullets, but rather focus on a practical and more holistic approach,  which could be adapted to many farming systems. And that's how we came about the five point  plan really, it was an accumulation of our ideas, the evidence and the science out there,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:04):**  but also equally the experiences of farmers who had had success with dealing with lameness.  And it was the common threads that led us to develop the five elements of the five point  plan. So the five point plan in brief has five action points which go contribute towards  supporting the animal in three different ways. So the first is all about building resilience.  That's about culling out the worst offenders, those with chronically misshapen or infected  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:31):**  feet, or inability to tackle this disease themselves. So creating a population of more  resilient individuals. Secondly, it's about establishing some immunity. Without going  into too much details, it's about using a vaccination to establish a level of population  immunity within the flock. And then the third way is all about reducing disease challenge.  So the level of disease on the farm, and there are three action points associated with that.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:10:59):**  So it's about avoiding spreading the disease, as we've described, it's spread by the ground  surface. So it's trying to break some of those transmission points. It's about rapid treatment  of clinical cases on the basis that they are a source of infection to other animals. And  importantly, it's about bringing in an element of quarantine, which we're all pretty familiar  with at this moment in time, so that we can reduce the possibility of spreading the disease  
**[0:11:24-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:24):**  from another flock.  Interesting. Okay, so Claire, coming back to you, you've been using the five point plan,  you said you've used it both on the FAI farm and on your own farm. Has it been successful?  Yes, yes, it has. And it takes it takes some getting your head round to start with, because  it's a totally different way of management. And I would say we made mistakes in the early  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:11:46):**  days where we just focused on the individual treatment bit, we kind of just thought, right,  we need to start individually treating and we got our heads around how we would do that.  And that's what we did. And we ended up doing that for a long time with without putting  some of the other things in place. So it didn't work to start with. And, and we were really  frustrated. But then I kind of sat down and relooked at it and, and realised that we were  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:09):**  missing some of the other elements. So one example, on where we are with a 10 days thing  we find really useful. So we've made sure that all of our sheep move every field, move  from a field to another one at least every 10 days. And they would never go back in into  something for more than 10 days after that, so that we plan. Yeah, five point planning  becomes part of our grazing, grazing planning.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:33):**  So if you've just got, you know, sheep that are up on a hillside or a mountain and, and  and they're roaming as they choose to, then that's going to make it very difficult to  implement this plan?  Well, it's, it's a case of, I think, Ruth used the words adaptive and the point about  the plan is that it's, it's principles rather than prescriptions or rules. So if you the  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:12:57):**  point is that you consider all of the five points within the plan, and you think about  how they are relevant to your farm. So, you know, for us on lowland rich, Oxfordshire  ground, and we are able to achieve that. And that's a really important part for us because  we're fairly heavily stocked with in the way that we have, you know, sheep constantly moving  around an area whereas on hills, you'll be much more extensively stocked. So that won't  
**[0:13:22-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:22):**  that won't be possible. But as long as you're looking at the other areas of the plan, and  making sure that everything is is you're doing as much as you can against it, then it's still  achievable yet everybody making their own plan for their own farm.  And in that way, I suppose the impression I'm getting with you know, these five points  that that you outlined, Ruth, that it's not about approaching them in a linear fashion,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:13:48):**  there isn't a sort of a story, you do this first, followed by that followed by that.  It's about trying to do all of the things at the same time and find the best way of  approaching it.  Yeah, no, I thought you're absolutely right that the five point plan is it is a framework.  And every farmer will have various different elements that they're already doing pretty  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:06):**  much nobody is starting from a position where they're not doing any of the elements of the  five point plan to try and control lameness at that the starting point. So the job is  to identify which elements of the plan are missing on an individual farm and would enable  you to tip the balance across from a grumbling sort of endemic lameness situation to it to  a situation where you really have this under control. And the key point is that this is  
**[0:14:30-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:30):**  a five point plan, and attention needs to be given to all five points of the plan. So  you just need to look and see where the gaps are really so and identify those gaps to ensure  that you're covering all of the bases.  And I guess that that's that that approach is important, not only for diseases relating  to lameness, but actually for other diseases as well. Like, you know, I was mentioning  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:14:54):**  Western Scotland where I used to live. And I remember having a conversation with a farmer  up there where he was really frustrated about liver fluke because, you know, he was saying  that he had treated his flock five times that year to try and eradicate the fluke. But of  course, you know, he was focusing, I guess, all of his attention on that treatment element  rather than necessarily recognising the importance of some of these other factors.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:15):**  Yeah, absolutely. And I think what's interesting is although we started looking at this approach,  obviously trying to tackle lameness and specifically foot rot and scold, actually the approach  that we're using, this more holistic approach is really applicable to all sorts of other  disease scenarios where actually perhaps we don't have a magic bullet, one thing that  we can throw at the disease that's going to fix it. But actually, we have to do multiple  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:15:41):**  elements. And as Claire said, actually, that that is more difficult to roll out, it's more  difficult to communicate with farmers. But I think we need to get better at doing this  because that this isn't the only disease where this kind of approach could be really beneficial.  So Claire, you said that you've been you've been using this yourself with, you know, initially  with less success than you hoped for, but ultimately, it started working really well.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:06):**  I wonder if you could tell me a couple of things. The first of all, how long how long  you've been working with the five point plan. And secondly, the Farm Animal Welfare Council,  of course, wants lameness to reduce down to 2% by 2021. We're nearly there. It's 2020.  Do you think that you're on track with the flocks that you manage?  Yes, we started using it in 2012 when when we got our sheep flock, and I would say, how  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:31):**  long did it take to become effective? It took as long as for me to sit down and look at  the plan properly, and not just think it was all about individual treatment. So as soon  as I sat down and looked at the plan, we were culling as well, actually, we you know, we  were culling. And that was hard to start with getting our head around culling for feet,  you know, not the really the more obvious things and we have a depending on where we  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:16:54):**  are on sheep numbers, a two or three strikes and you're out when it comes to and when it  comes to lameness. And so it took to having to catch and treat an individual animal more  than two or three times would render it for the cull pile at the next available opportunity  at whether that be weaning or scanning or something. And we do that now with more technology,  farm technology systems, but we also still do adopt on the shoulder of the lame leg,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:21):**  which means that other people working around the farm can see whether animals have been  treated or not. But it also obviously lose that information at shearing when the animal  gets sheared. But it's quite a good indicator when you see a lame animal to see, okay, she's  been treated a few times before really easily without having to look it up on the system.  So it took us long before I actually sat down and looked at the other points in the bits  
**[0:17:40-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:17:40):**  that we started to vaccinate. And it was the avoiding bit. So starting to think about where  we do have animals walking over the same ground. So maybe putting our electric fences up slightly  differently, closing or fixing gates, we had broken gates, so we would have a gate open  between two fields. So of course, all the animals are channeling backwards and forwards  through it, making sure we if we do have lick buckets, or if we do have movable water troughs  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:06):**  or anything where animals are congregating, moving those on every day, so that it just  minimises the infection, the infection rate, because I think that's the bit as soon as  you if you look in a field of sheep, and you'll see they follow tracks, and they all follow  each other. And when you've got a ewe, you've got her lambs following behind. And that's  when it gets really hard when lambs start picking up scold, and they're all chasing  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:29):**  each other around. So they're all just picking it up from each other. So it was making some  practical changes. And basically, that was it looking at the whole plan. And then and  then we started to see the results. And that was great. And are we on track for the FAWC  targets? I would say that yes, we are now we do if the weather goes bad, or they've  been in a field with maybe really some long grass, and we will see a spike. But what we  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:18:52):**  do, which is a recommendation within the five point plan that we didn't do originally, but  is a really useful tool, I think is like a regular lameness score. So possibly even sometimes  our stock manager for sheep would do it, but actually, sometimes with someone else on the  farm will do it where you go out, rather than doing it as part of sheep checks, or as part  of another job, actually, stop, stand back and go out and just look for lameness. So  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:14):**  kind of look across the field, and you count the number that you know, see lame, and there's  some certain parameters, however you want to do it. And then actually look at that number.  And then that gives you a really good sense of what your percentage lameness is at any  one time on the farm. And we do that two or three times a year at set times. And so it's  a really good indicator for ourselves. It's not the only thing we do, but it just it helps  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:36):**  us see whether we're overall on track for that. And mostly we sit at 2%, 2% or below.  And sometimes we do have spikes. But in the main when we get a spike, we write, okay,  all action, what are we going to do to bring it back down? Because we know that if we let  that creep up, it just ends up with everybody, well, not everybody, but people spending hours  doing treatments.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:19:58):**  And so if you if you were at 2% ish now, then when you sort of came in at 2012, and started  working with it, what do you think your percentage would have been about then just to give people  an idea of where you've come from and got to  Oh, at times we would have would have been at 10%. But I've worked on other farms where  it's been, you know, it's been much, much higher than that.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:22):**  Yeah. And certainly I've seen farms where you're up to a third or even half of sheep  displaying some level of lameness.  My friend Alice has a good saying was when the bad becomes the norm, and she used that  referring to dairy cow lameness is that people just get people just get so used to seeing  it. It's not it's not regarded as a problem. And it's the solutions haven't always been  
**[0:20:43-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:20:43):**  there or they're difficult to implement. And it is hard. And the practicalities around  individual treatments or individual catching, if you don't have, you know, a really a super  dog, then you're having to gather them in order to catch them. And then you have this  balance of where we gather them, we bring them all together, and we've got lots of cross  contamination. And you know, so just sort of having to think about what how do we balance  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:07):**  that and how do we tackle it in the right way? And it certainly hurt my head. Others  might find it easier. But for me, I was like, I just don't know what to do for the best.  It's difficult.  And I think Claire, you know, really well demonstrates the challenges that can be faced,  particularly actually at the beginning when you're trying to get the five point plan implemented  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:28):**  and get your lameness levels under control. It's it can be really challenging. So quite  often there's a there's at least a sort of six month period when you really have to weather  the storm a bit in order to try and get under control and probably put more effort in than  you would like to do to try and bring it under control. But just in the in the knowledge  that actually if you can do that, you can flip this from being a constant sort of process  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:21:53):**  of treating lame animals into a truly preventative approach, then then you will reap the rewards  at a later time. And that's really something important to keep in mind that the whole purpose  of this is to try and transform the management into a preventative strategy rather than a  sort of firefighting one.  Fantastic. So I think we've been teasing people enough. We talked about it. We've talked about  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:16):**  the fact that it's successful. We've mentioned the headlines. Let's get into the full movie  now. And so I wonder if we could go into the five point plan, you know, kind of point by  point and just go into it in a bit more detail. Where would you like to start, Ruth?  Tricky to know where to start, because as I said, different farms will need to focus  on different elements depending on what they're doing. But anyway, let's start at the top,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:22:39):**  as it were. And the first point I usually mention is, is culling out the worst offenders.  Most farms will have a small population of sheep, as Claire very eloquently described,  of repeat offenders, animals who've been laying before. Maybe they've got chronically damaged  feet. They're more likely to pick up the infection again. And and they are constant sources of  infection. It's not uncommon to hear farmers saying, oh, but, you know, they had twins,  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:05):**  they had triplets, they're good producers. But actually, the reality is that these animals  are costing money and resources. And it really would be beneficial for the whole flock to  cull that population out, leaving you with a more resilient population as a starting  point. So, you know, a great place to start with with the plan is it is at culling time,  you've got an opportunity to try and get in control in your ewe flock, within the knowledge  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:32):**  that it's the ewe flock that spread this disease to the next crop of lambs, you know, this  this bacteria, although it's prevalent, it's on the pasture for small amounts of time,  it's not primarily living on the pasture, it's living in the sheep. So that's the first  point, culling out your very worst offenders. And then moving on round the five point plan  diagram, the next point, and in fact, the next three points are all about trying to  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:23:55):**  say, well, you know, that this this disease is spread animal to animal via the floor surface.  So how do we reduce the level of disease? How do we reduce those transmissions hotspots?  The first point there is all about avoiding that transmission, as Claire described some  some useful pointers there. So, you know, any any areas of high congregation of animals,  water troughs, feed troughs, mineral buckets, gateways, trying to address those potentially  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:24):**  using lime in areas that can't be moved or moving things that can be moved, shutting  gateways, but also thinking about how that could be transmitted during handling and trying  to improve the ground surface there.  And we've talked about the, you know, the the fact that it exists for up to 10 days  on the ground. How long does it actually exist in the sheep themselves? And can it can the  
**[0:24:45-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:24:45):**  diseases be latent and sort of re-emerge?  Yeah, there is some evidence that it that it can be particularly in these animals who've  got chronically damaged feet, that it could be grumbling in there, you know, for long,  much longer periods of time. But effectively, it's it's there on the sheep's foot for as  long as it's an active infection. But yeah, that is possible that it that particular animals  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:07):**  in it could be harbouring the disease.  So again, culling, you know, is important from that perspective as well. And I wonder  as well, because we touched on this earlier, but how effective the plan is in different  landscapes. And obviously, what Claire was talking about in terms of being able to move  her flock from this field, you know, to another field, and then not bringing them back into  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:27):**  the same field, you know, for 10 days, etc. That that is much harder on hill land or on  the mountainside. So how would how would how would you expect farmers or have you got experience  of farmers trying to manage that in hill land?  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's almost every farm brings its own challenges in some respects  and where you have more extensive grazing scenarios, then then yes, you have less opportunities  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:25:51):**  to perhaps tackle some of the individual hotspots that we've just described. Largely, the animals  tend to be more spread out with a reduced stocking density, which can be beneficial.  But you can also have co grazing. So that means collaborating with neighbours to try  and get on top of this, you know, as a region. So, yeah, every farm has its challenges. And  it really is about looking at the framework and saying, Okay, you know, what, where are  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:18):**  the areas that potentially this disease could be spread on my farm in my setting, and trying  to look long and hard at how you can address some of them. And some of them are really  difficult and you just can't address. So you have to accept some of those and work on the  bits that you can  and presumably involving your vet wherever possible in in kind of making some of those  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:36):**  decisions. So sort of farmers and vets working together, I know that, you know, some vets,  particularly the old school are more reluctant to kind of give land management advice advice  about things that aren't directly linked to, to giving medicines.  Yeah, I think you're right. But but what's encouraging is that the veterinary community  have been really supportive of this kind of approach. And I think there is a growing acknowledgement  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:26:59):**  that that actually, as vets, we need to be more experts in these sort of holistic approaches,  which include things like grazing management, husbandry, biosecurity, and all of those elements.  So I think, you know, the majority of vets, particularly sheep vets should be able to  help really constructively with looking practically on a farm at how this framework applies in  different settings, and giving some good practical and actionable advice about how to how to  
**[0:27:28-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:28):**  implement.  Okay, so we've had culling, which helps to build resilience, we've moved into that reducing  the disease challenge, sort of section with we've talked about avoidance, should we go  on to treating?  Yeah, relatively simple in some respects, although as Claire says, not easy to do with  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:27:45):**  individuals, but this is about acknowledging that that, you know, a lame animal with a  bacterial foot condition will be potentially spreading that disease to other animals, other  ewes, other lambs. And when you get outbreaks of scald, that is coming from ewes with foot  rot or scald. So it's about identifying those animals and treating them as rapidly as possible,  easier said than done. I absolutely know from bitter experience, but it's about doing the  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:12):**  best you can here in the knowledge that actually, if you get this right, you're going to have  a lot fewer of these in the future to deal with. It starts coming down to the odd one  rather than, you know, lame animals in every field, which is much more manageable than  a scenario where you're looking at sort of, as you say, five, 10, up to half animals lame  in fields that that's really challenging, but also getting the right treatment for the  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:38):**  right disease. So this is about understanding the correct diagnosis. So again, working with  your vet here is important. Are you primarily looking at foot rot? Do you have some CODD  in there? So you're getting the right antibiotics to treat at the right time. But ultimately  looking to reduce this, really what we want to do is we want to do a good job here, such  that we're doing less of this in the future.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:28:58):**  Brilliant. And so we're foot rot, we're talking about octa tetracycline presumably is the  main one as opposed to CODD with amoxicillin and those medicines are doing different things.  So if you diagnose it wrong, the medicines aren't going to work.  Yeah, absolutely. Getting the right diagnosis will allow you to administer the correct treatment,  obviously the correct dose. And if you're able to treat those animals as rapidly as  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:23):**  possible, you're treating them at the right time. So it's really about targeting that  treatment. And as I say that the critical thing here is, you know, if we do a good job  on the whole plan, this is what we want to be doing less of in the future.  So moving on to quarantine.  Yeah, this is really important. So two elements to this. This is about quarantining on farm.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:29:44):**  So for instance, if you do have lame animals, particularly at the beginning of the plan,  when you're trying to get on top of things, you know, one idea would be to separate those  animals and you know, have a lame field where you can deal with those animals separately,  if possible, or if you're housing them have a pen where you've got animals that you're  struggling to control the lameness levels in. This might include some of those, those  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:06):**  chronic feet before you're able to cull them. But also importantly, if you're bringing animals  onto the farm, you really need to have a robust quarantine procedure in place so that you're  keeping them separate. You're protecting the incoming animals, but you're also protecting  your existing flock from either different strains of the foot rot bacteria or from CODD.  And how long are those quarantines going to last? Are they the kind of 10 days that we've  
**[0:30:27-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:27):**  been talking about?  Well, a little bit longer really. This is particularly, it's important for foot rot,  and you want to be able to nail those animals and treat them as quickly as possible if they  do come in with any signs of lameness. But with CODD, you can have lesions, CODD lesions  before the animals become lame, it tends to start higher up on the foot. So it's really  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:30:48):**  important to keep an eye out for those because you do not want to be bringing CODD into your  flock if you're not currently struggling with that.  So that quarantine for how long? Two, three weeks?  Yes, we would recommend four weeks quarantine procedure. But obviously, you know, this needs  to be drawn up in collaboration with your vet who can help you not only for lameness,  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:08):**  there could be other reasons why you're quarantining as well. So you can tie this in with all sorts  of other pathogens.  So we talked about culling to build resilience. We talked about reducing the disease challenge  and we've looked at avoid and treat and quarantine. There's one point left in the five point plan.  Yeah, so this is all about trying to establish some immunity, some vaccine immunity. Actually,  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:30):**  the reason that the animals can become repeatedly infected is because natural immunity is relatively  short lived, unfortunately. And indeed, the vaccine immunity mirrors that that scenario.  So we there is a vaccine on the market only one, it covers the majority of strains of  the foot rot bacteria. So it's a really useful tool. But on its own, it's it's unlikely to  control foot rot, but as part of the five point plan, it gives you a really useful building  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:31:57):**  block to try and give these animals some level of immunity while you're trying to get on  top of it. And some farmers also describe using the vaccine as a kind of insurance policy  once they have got once they've implemented the five point plan their own control, administering  the vaccine allows them a level of ongoing control as a kind of insurance against going  back down to unfavourable levels of lameness in the future.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:21):**  Fantastic. That's really helpful. So we've got culling, vaccination, quarantining, treating,  and avoiding all these these the five points of the plan that you've developed in Claire  just sort of coming back to you. I mean, you talked about the fact that you know, it was  it was perhaps difficult to get your head around it in the first place because, you  know, you're sort of trying to, you know, look at treatment or prioritise one over and  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:32:44):**  above the other. But once you've discovered that you need to approach all of these five  elements at once, how difficult is it to implement? It sounds like it's a reasonable management  framework and that once you've set that management framework in place, it should be reasonably  straightforward to deliver.  Yeah, once once you get your head around it, it absolutely is. And particularly when you  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:05):**  get through that possibly painful early stage where you're learning how to do things in  a different way, starting to look out for different things and think about the way you're  managing the managing the farm in a different way. Once you've got through that, and you've  got it under control. Yeah. Then suddenly lameness is like a oh, you know, it's a problem.  But if we spot a lame sheep, we know what to do. We treat her straight away. And it  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:27):**  doesn't likely doesn't likely spread. And what's interesting now is that we get lameness,  but it's so, you know, sheep with obviously painful feet that are limping. But often,  very rarely now is it actually scald or foot rot. It's often a bit of twig stuck in it  or a toe that's caught and torn or, you know, it's other we're discovering all these other  reasons other other things that make sheep lame and which were always there, of course.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:33:55):**  But when foot rot and scald were so much bigger parts of what we did, we you know, we didn't  really see that. And often, of course, a sheep with a piece of something twig stuck between  her toes would would also probably have scald and foot rot or one of the other or both at  the same time and same time as that. So, yeah, we lameness. It's really surprising how we  just don't have those those problems anymore. So lameness used to be a big part of my life.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:20):**  But now it's not so much and that's great. But it does require a mindset, a mindset change.  And of course, when you're on a larger farm like we are, it's not just me that's needed  to get my head around it. It's the rest of the farm team as well. And then of course,  that that can be challenging. But once you start to see the results, then it kind of  clicks and you're like, yes, I get it and it works and I can see how it's working. And  
**[0:34:41-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:34:41):**  then and that's great. But it's something that you just need to stay on top of. And  you know, at times it happens to us because of other pressures on a mixed farm. And there's  a few that might start to go lame. Oh, someone will say, oh, you know, we'll deal with those  another day. And of course, then a few more. And then we end up we're on floodplains here.  So sometimes some fields can come in quite wet and that might be where we get a problem.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:03):**  And we might get quite a few. And then we realise that we've let it get, you know, out  of control, but we just give it some focus again and get back on top of it.  So once it's implemented, it's it's relatively straightforward to manage that it makes a  big difference to your life in terms of the amount of time and money that you're spending  on lameness related issues. But let's just think about that mindset change and those  
**[0:35:25-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:25):**  first six months. And as with any management change, you can see things getting worse sometimes  before they get better while you're trying to implement new systems and and really, you  know, get a proper full understanding of that change that you're implementing. So are there  any tips or suggestions that you can give to farmers or vets who are listening to this  and, you know, interested in taking this on and would be grateful for them?  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:35:49):**  I'd say I don't know if it gets worse before it gets better. But what you what you often  don't see is results straight away. And when that happens, it's really easy to think, oh,  this doesn't work. This isn't working. Let's stop. Stop it all and go back to what we know.  And I think that's the key thing is to stick with it. Be patient. And also, as my experience  is, look at the plan. If it's not working after quite a long period of time, it's likely  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:15):**  that something in the plan is missing. And so we look at what you're doing and go through  it again. And there are some useful tools available online to, you know, to give you  some guidance about what to look for and download some of those and just go through it with  a fine tooth comb.  So just finally, let's just think about the costs. And I wonder if there's anything that  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:36:37):**  we've learned about the cost of dealing with lameness and how that's changed as a result  of using the five point plan.  Yeah, well, actually, what we do know is that we don't have great data on levels of lameness  across the UK. But what we do know is on individual farms, if you had an average prevalence of  around 10 percent, then there is a really good cost calculator produced by Reading University  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:03):**  that estimates that would be costing you about eight pounds fifty five per year in the flock  per year. So for every year you've got in the flock, that's eight pounds fifty five  at a level of 10 percent. So that's a significant cost. And that would be made up of direct  costs. So the actual cost of treating those ewes with antibiotics, but also those hidden  costs of a loss of productivity.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:26):**  And so presumably, if you can bring those costs down in any way at all with a different  management regime, that's got to be beneficial for your system.  Yeah. So, I mean, the only element within here that requires an additional direct cost  would be the vaccine, which roughly costs about two pounds per year and initially some  increased time in terms of pulling the plan together, trying to put in some extra effort  
**[0:37:52-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:37:52):**  to identify those hotspots for disease transmission. But ultimately, you're trying to reduce the  time, the lost productivity and also the cost of treatments, such that that becomes a much  lower level. So, you know, if you're looking at a cost of eight pounds fifty five per year,  but you're looking to reduce that enormously and perhaps replacing that with a cost of  two pounds for the vaccine, you really should be looking at a significant reduction in the  
**[0:38:19-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:19):**  costs of managing lameness over time.  Thanks very much, both of you. I think it's been really interesting hearing about the  plan and about the way that the different elements work together. And I wonder if either  of you have a sense, you know, since the plan was first put together and I think, Ruth,  it was you that developed it in the first place. Do you have any sense of what the take-up  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:38:41):**  has been like across the nation, whether this is used by, you know, what percentage of sheep  farmers and shepherds are using this?  Yeah, really hard to say. We know that it's quite well known. We know that quite a good  population of sheep focused vets are using and recommending the plan. And various anecdotal  reports tell us that a significant number of farmers have been using it. And there is  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:07):**  also evidence that that lameness levels are coming down and in particular may have hit  the forked target of less than five percent by 2016. So we know that it's out there, it's  being used. I still think there's more to be done. There's more farmers that could be  helped, but I still think there's a way to go to where we're really truly in control  of this disease.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:28):**  And if vets and farmers want to find out more about the Five Point Plan and about how to  use it for themselves, where can they go? Where's the best place to start looking?  Yeah, there's quite a lot of resources out there. One thing that we have managed to achieve  with the Five Point Plan is a consensus that this will be the national approach to dealing  with this disease. And so we've tried to harmonise the message and the communications for vets  
**[0:39:52-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:39:52):**  and farmers to try and add that level of consistency into dealing with this disease. So you can  find resources on the FAI website. You will also be able to find information from individual  veterinary surgeons, particularly those focused on sheep. And a quick Google will also give  you all sorts of resources from a lot of the sheep organisations in the UK detailing the  Five Point Plan and how you can go about starting to use it.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Sheep-lameness--the-5-Point-Plan-ed12g0#t=0:40:19):**  Well, thank you very much. I mean, that's all we've got time for. And I found that really  fascinating. It's a really interesting conversation. And thank you both for your contribution.

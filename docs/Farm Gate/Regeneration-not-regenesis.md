### Farm Gate  (Thu, 15 Sep 2022 07:30:38)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke stain, the chief executive of Farmwell and  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:09):**  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. Jyoti Fernandes is from the UK Land Workers  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:14):**  Alliance and well known as a campaigner working for the rights of small farmers and peasant  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:19):**  farmers. She's also a Dorset smallholder, farming regeneratively and producing fruits,  
**[0:00:24-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:24):**  cider, lamb and cheese, which are all sold locally. We're talking today because Jyoti  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:28):**  recently wrote an open letter to The Guardian writer George Monbiot, whose book, Regenesis  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:33):**  and the articles he's written to promote it, undermine and distort public awareness  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:37):**  of the regenerative solutions to the ecological crisis that this podcast supports. Jyoti has  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:43):**  known George for many years, campaigning alongside him on issues such as GM foods and invasive  
**[0:00:48-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:48):**  species. In her letter, Jyoti says, demonising organic pasture fed meat is unhelpful, polarising  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:00:55):**  and alienating. The suspicion it casts on organic farming as a whole threatens to undermine  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:00):**  the agroecology movement, which provides the most compelling future narrative that I have  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:05):**  found in 30 years of campaigning. Jyoti, welcome to Farmgate. You wrote in your letter, I feel  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:11):**  duty bound to intervene. Why? What is it that's upset you so much about George Monbiot's  
**[0:01:17-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:17):**  book?  
**[0:01:18-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:18):**  Jyoti Fernandes I work every day with peasant farmers, indigenous  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:21):**  people around the world who are practising small scale agroecological farming, and that  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:27):**  might be forest farming, it might be working as nomadic pastoralists, it might be people  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:32):**  that have a small scale farm where they use livestock as part of the farming system that  
**[0:01:37-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:37):**  also generates arable crops, it might generate dairy products, and have fruit as part of  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:43):**  it as well. But all across the world, these small scale farming systems provide a huge  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:49):**  amount of global food supply and a huge amount of the actual nutrition security that's out  
**[0:01:53-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:53):**  there. It might not be the bulk amount of calories that are out there that the global  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:01:57):**  food system produces, but it's the part of the global food system that provides the most  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:01):**  nutrition security. And within all of these systems, livestock plays a very important  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:05):**  role. Livestock, there's too much of it, you know, there's huge factory farms, there's  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:09):**  industrial farming, there's huge amounts of land that are dedicated to, you know, monocultural  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:13):**  production of animals, and it's taking up too much land. But livestock is still an important  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:18):**  part of our global food system and important part of it for the future. And in peasant  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:23):**  farming systems, it's particularly important because in peasant farming systems, livestock  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:27):**  plays an important role in nutrient cycling and making sure that fertility goes back to  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:32):**  the land, you know, when animals graze, then that manure is then composted, and it's put  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:36):**  back into the land to provide soil fertility. Often it provides transport, you know, and  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:41):**  plowing. And many times it also uses the waste food that's part of the arable system, you  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:45):**  know, there might be like the byproducts of a production system, and the animals eat those  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:50):**  byproducts or those co-products or those waste products, and then they generate, you know,  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:55):**  really high quality nutrition security by having dairy or meat that's available for  
**[0:02:59-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:02:59):**  families to eat in their local community.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:00):**  I think people listening would agree with the vast majority of what you just said there.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:04):**  One thing I want to pick up on is the idea that perhaps farming is taking up too much  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:07):**  land. Is it taking up too much land or is it that certain types of agriculture are taking  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:12):**  up more land than they should and that the way that we farm sort of needs a redistribution  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:17):**  around the land that's already being used?  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:19):**  Yeah, we're very much about the idea of fair share and balance. And I think the whole food  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:23):**  system has just gone severely out of balance. It's gone out of kilter because we've got  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:27):**  different forms of agriculture out there. There's the industrial food chain, which is  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:33):**  producing things on large monocultures, you know, using high amounts of inputs, you know,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:38):**  pesticides, herbicides, nitrate fertilisers, and then selling into the global market economy.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:42):**  And then there's the agroecological food webs, which is what we defend in La Verre Campesina.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:46):**  And I've spent a lot of time working on thinking about how that can be moved forward into the  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:50):**  future to be the basis of our local food systems. But the industrialised food chain uses almost  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:03:56):**  70% of global agricultural resources to produce only about 30% of nutritional food security  
**[0:04:03-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:03):**  around the planet. That's because there's a lot of calories being pumped out there,  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:06):**  which are wasted, which go into animal agriculture in a very inefficient way. And it produces  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:11):**  a lot of waste where the agroecological food webs are much more efficient. And sometimes  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:16):**  they might be extensive. It's not just about yield, they might be extensive, but they're  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:20):**  providing a valuable ecosystem service. And they're there as a part of an agroecological  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:25):**  food web that's actually providing nutrition security. Yield isn't everything, but we've  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:30):**  got to think about balance. And when we think about balance, we think about reducing the  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:33):**  amount of livestock that's out there, but thinking about increasing the amount of agroecological  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:39):**  food that's being produced and distributing more efficiently so that people can be fed  
**[0:04:42-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:42):**  on it.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:43):**  And I think that, you know, that phrase that you used, ecosystem efficiency, I think that's  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:46):**  the thing that George Monbiot in particular seems to undervalue. You know, he's sort of  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:51):**  focused on climate and he's focused on resource efficiency, but other ecosystem elements seem  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:55):**  to get lost. Now, we're going to talk more about the book later and some other themes  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:04:59):**  that you've already picked up on. But for now, something that comes across really strongly  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:03):**  in your letter is the sense of betrayal that you clearly feel, a betrayal of the movement  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:09):**  that you've spent your working life supporting. Tell us more about that movement as a whole.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:14):**  What sort of people are represented by the Land Workers Alliance and by the global organisation  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:19):**  to which it's affiliated that you mentioned, La Via Campesina?  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:22):**  So the Land Workers Alliance is a small and family farmer's union and also for foresters  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:28):**  and land-based workers. So we also represent people who are looking after our woods and  
**[0:05:32-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:32):**  our woodland. We are a part of La Via Campesina, which is a global movement representing over  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:36):**  200 million farmers across the world. That's farmers, peasant farmers and indigenous people.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:41):**  Also people who are part of the rural economy and foresters across the world as well. We  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:46):**  represent people in about 82 different countries and that's ranging from the National Farmers  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:50):**  Union of Canada to the vast movements of small scale farmers across Latin America, also representing  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:05:56):**  indigenous people in those contexts, Africa, India, all across Asia, up into Russia, members  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:03):**  all across the world providing food for their local communities.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:07):**  Now I often work as a representative of La Via Campesina in international circles and  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:12):**  I think this is where that sense of betrayal comes from in understanding how difficult  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:16):**  it is for us to get our message across. Because often I sit in the committee on food security  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:21):**  and it meets in October in Rome and there's meetings throughout the year. I've been on  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:25):**  the livestock group, the committee on food security, as well as many other ones looking  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:29):**  at sustainable development goals. I've been to COP26 as a representative of the farmers  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:33):**  constituency there. And when you sit in those places, it's a huge contest. It's a contest  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:39):**  and it's a competition and it's a battleground for the narrative of the future of our food  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:43):**  system. The private sector is there in full force. You've got Nestle, Bill Gates, McDonald's,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:49):**  all these corporations there. And actually the committee on food security recognises  
**[0:06:52-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:52):**  them as people that have a legitimate right to speak. They get a place to sit with a little  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:06:56):**  microphone they can push and a little sign in front of them. The same as every nation  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:00):**  does and the same as all the representatives of civil society like La Via Campesina representing  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:06):**  peasant farmers, the indigenous peoples movement, the World Workers Union, the consumer health  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:12):**  advocates and all of the representatives of civil society. We also have our own seats,  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:16):**  but we're up against the private sector and we're up against the narrative and the spin  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:21):**  on what the future of our food system is. They're always promoting yield. They're always  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:24):**  promoting technological solutions, liberalisation of the global market economy. It's very difficult  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:30):**  to get our message about agri-ecological food webs in there. And whenever something pushes  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:35):**  forward the narrative that supports their idea that the solutions need to come from  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:40):**  science or from people in a laboratory creating something that can be bought, sold and traded  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:45):**  makes it very difficult to get the support that we need for our own seed-saving networks,  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:50):**  for development based on peasant farming knowledge and indigenous peoples knowledge, for the  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:07:55):**  social innovations and the economic innovations we need to make our local food systems efficient.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:00):**  Things like co-operatives and distribution hubs and processing. And particularly we need  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:05):**  support for the development of default livestock systems. That means livestock that works in  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:10):**  a secular way with the land so that we're using co-products, waste products and byproducts  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:15):**  to have efficient production of meat on a small scale level.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:18):**  I'm really interested in what you were saying about the committee on world food security  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:23):**  and the balance between nation states and private enterprise and then organisations  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:29):**  such as yourselves. Now obviously the nation states are there. We take that as read. And  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:34):**  I mean you talk about individuals like Bill Gates. Are they representing themselves or  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:39):**  is he representing Microsoft or representing his foundation?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:43):**  Yeah, it's really interesting because in the civil society mechanism that operates at the  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:48):**  committee on food security, we have one representative for each of those key stakeholder groups.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:55):**  And the key stakeholder groups, the rights holders, are in the millions. You know, it's  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:08:58):**  the global population of the planet in the case of consumers because everybody eats food  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:03):**  across the whole planet. And they operate in the civil society mechanism according to  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:07):**  a rights-based approach to food. That everybody has the right to food and it's government's  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:11):**  responsibility to implement the policies needed to make sure everybody has access to healthy,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:16):**  affordable food, sustainably produced so future generations can also have food. And they step  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:21):**  back and take that broad approach. The private sector mechanism is actually placed on equal  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:26):**  footing in the committee on food security and they're there representing their own private  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:31):**  sector corporations. And they're there because governments around the world have moved into  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:36):**  this neo-liberal theory towards the market solving what we need to do with our food system.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:41):**  It's this whole move globally towards the market solving all of our, you know, taking  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:45):**  care of all of our basic needs. And it's very difficult sometimes to place that in your  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:51):**  mind theoretically on equal footing with the rights holders of the planet because really  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:55):**  the rights holders are representing the public good, the common good. The private sector  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:09:59):**  should actually just be a tool if it's anything, but it shouldn't be seen as rights holders.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:04):**  They're actually, they're not the stakeholders, they're the stake eaters is what we call them.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:08):**  You know, one time I was supposed to be speaking on behalf of civil society on a certain topic  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:12):**  and we spent a lot of time, two weeks in the run up to this plus a whole process for all  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:17):**  of our organizations to come up with our collectively held positions, you know, so that when we  
**[0:10:23-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:23):**  speak, we're speaking on behalf of millions, we're not speaking as individuals, you know.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:27):**  And then we get our position together, it's collectively decided, we put forward, you  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:31):**  know, a rotation of different spokespeople trying to get people from the very grassroots,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:34):**  even from villages or fishing communities or indigenous landscapes to come and speak  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:39):**  and represent what's happening to them. But it can often be that the spokesperson from  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:43):**  Nestle can be put in the speaking order ahead of you. And sometimes you don't even get time  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:46):**  to be able to speak. And I remember this one time after, you know, we'd spent two weeks  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:50):**  preparing this position I was supposed to present when actually that happened, that  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:54):**  representative from Nestle was giving the speaking spot instead of civil society. We  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:10:57):**  were quite upset about that. And I tell you, you know, these power politics are in play,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:02):**  you know, across the UK government as well. You know, with the Landworkers Alliance, we've  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:07):**  been working quite hard to try and get a share of our piece of the pie for the UKRI development  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:13):**  funding, innovation funding for agriculture. And whenever we try and put in bids, the shape  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:19):**  of what the forms look like very much favors the private sector instead of knowledge intensive  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:25):**  agriculture or concepts like default livestock, which actually can save farmers money because  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:29):**  you're reducing the amount of inputs that go into agriculture. It favors the kind of  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:33):**  input driven innovation and research and development because it asks for what your return on investment  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:38):**  is. So you have to be in partnership with a private company in order to put the bid  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:42):**  in and then you have to illustrate what the return on investment is. And the private sector  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:47):**  partner can, it's only a partial funding that they give them to put in towards it because  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:51):**  they have to pitch in their own money. So they want their own return on investment as  
**[0:11:55-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:55):**  well as the return on investment going into the bid. That means it has to be something  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:11:58):**  that's bought, sold and traded. And it makes it very difficult to get the support for the  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:02):**  agri-ecological solutions we want to research and develop and improve yields with or whatever  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:07):**  it is.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:08):**  In your experience, and you've clearly been at a lot of these committees and you've been  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:10):**  involved in a lot of government processes. Are there any companies out there that are  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:15):**  singing from roughly the same hymn sheet that are thinking about agroecology rather than,  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:20):**  you know, new tech or resource efficiency? Obviously, resource efficiency is important,  
**[0:12:24-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:24):**  but it's just one metric amongst many metrics.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:26):**  I would say that generally the corporate sector and the way that it operates, because it's  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:31):**  operating according to a certain formula, it's very difficult to get the sort of agri-ecological  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:35):**  solutions where you want to see moving forward. And that formula is that it's trying to generate  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:39):**  profit and that profit needs to go back to the stakeholders. It's hardwired in their  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:43):**  DNA not to be compatible with the most sustainable solutions. Now there are definitely business  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:48):**  models that we can move forward with that's working as cooperatives, independent businesses,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:52):**  local food economies, circular economies on a local level. And there's companies like  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:12:57):**  Podma Dods, for example, that's absolutely brilliant. It's working with UK farmers trying  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:01):**  to grow pulses and grains and facilitates that development of higher yields and better  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:06):**  nutritional quality and better processing and the use of co-products and byproducts  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:11):**  for animal feeds as well through their profit that they make as a company. And that's an  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:15):**  incredible example where you see cooperatives like Yo Valley that's working with farmers  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:21):**  to improve incomes and try and give farmers better profits. But by and large, the corporate  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:26):**  sector, it'd be very difficult to move forward with these kinds of solutions. That's where  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:30):**  I get the suspicion about the idea of precision fermentation or cultured meat actually being  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:35):**  able to be an open source technology or be a very useful solution when we look at our  
**[0:13:39-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:39):**  future scenarios for food.  
**[0:13:41-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:41):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:49):**  and of course, you know, Podma Dods is that go to example. And what we urgently need are  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:53):**  an awful lot more companies like Podma Dods, businesses that are working in that way. I'm  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:13:59):**  just going to whip back to something that you were talking about earlier on where you  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:02):**  mentioned the members of La Via Campesina. And within that, you mentioned the National  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:07):**  Farmers Union of Canada. Now, the NFU in the UK, I would not put in the same category as  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:14):**  the Land Workers Alliance. So I'm really interested. Are the NFU in Canada really so different  
**[0:14:19-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:19):**  to the NFU in the United Kingdom?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:21):**  In fact, NFU of Canada was one of the founding members of La Via Campesina alongside all  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:25):**  these global coalitions of peasant farmers across the world, because it was recognised  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:30):**  that corporate control of the food system was actually one of the main problems facing  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:36):**  farmers and farmers livelihoods. And so National Farmers Union of Canada joined at that point,  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:42):**  we also have the Family Farm Defenders of America, and you know, a huge coalition of  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:47):**  different organisations across the United States that are members of La Via Campesina  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:51):**  as well. And that's because across all of us, we see that there's a big difference between  
**[0:14:56-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:14:56):**  the industrialised food chain and what that does to farmers livelihoods to the soils we  
**[0:15:00-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:00):**  depend on and to the natural environment and agri-political food webs that we can create  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:07):**  in any country.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:08):**  I just wonder, do you think that the United Nations and international processes like the  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:13):**  COP Climate and Biodiversity Talks are becoming any better at recognising the needs and knowledge  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:19):**  of peasants and indigenous farmers? Because certainly, you know, that's something that  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:23):**  we've heard before on the podcast that there, you know, there was a big problem in the past  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:27):**  in getting that balance between science and capital and new tech and indigenous experience.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:34):**  And while it isn't perfect by any means that there has been an improvement, would you go  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:38):**  along with that?  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:39):**  There has been a change in thinking and partly that's from the work of civil society, from  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:44):**  the work of these organisations. About a decade ago at the United Nations level, there was  
**[0:15:49-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:49):**  the report called the ISTAT report that the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:53):**  Delivery Shooter sponsored, which looked at the broken food system, it looked at the fact  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:15:58):**  that you know, we're producing more calories now than we need to feed the planet because  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:03):**  of the Green Revolution. But at the same time, we still have so many people who are acutely  
**[0:16:08-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:08):**  hungry and facing malnutrition, at the same time, loads of people facing obesity. We've  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:13):**  got the huge destruction that the agricultural system causes on the natural environment,  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:18):**  the loss of insects, you know, the fact that 30% of the contribution to climate change  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:23):**  emissions comes from our broken food system and said, okay, well, what's going wrong here?  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:28):**  And the report basically said, where we need to move forward is in promoting agroecology,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:33):**  and looking at small and family farms, and building our future research and development  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:37):**  on indigenous knowledge systems. You know, thinking about the agro biodiversity that's  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:42):**  being supported by peasant farmers, they breed so many different varieties of seed, the industrial  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:48):**  food chain breeds about 12 different varieties. It's in the millions, the number of varieties  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:52):**  that are bred on the ground by peasant farmers, and also the livestock breeds that are kept  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:16:56):**  by nomadic pastoralists, the traditional knowledge of how livestock can fit in to sustainable  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:02):**  land management systems. You know, that that knowledge is there and needs to be built on.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:06):**  But it also means a great deal of self reflection back on the farming movement. And like I said,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:11):**  within La Via Campesina, we have this tension, we've got some of you know, the big farms  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:15):**  that are small farms, but they might be 1500 acres or whatever it is in Canada, at the  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:20):**  same time as you know, the very small peasant farms in Eastern Europe or in Africa, the  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:24):**  forest farming systems of the Amazon rainforest, and we've got the indigenous people as part  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:28):**  of our civil society movement as well. And we've got to think about fair share. And that  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:33):**  means a great deal of self reflection, of thinking about how we move and change to create  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:39):**  a future food system, holding those livelihoods as part of our green growth and developing  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:44):**  that knowledge so that it works in harmony with the earth and moving forward. And it  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:48):**  means self reflection, change in practice, but built on the knowledge and passion that  
**[0:17:54-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:54):**  we've got.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:17:55):**  Jodie, thanks so much for that global perspective. Coming back to George, I think that most reasonable  
**[0:18:00-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:00):**  people would recognise the environmental challenges that he sets out in Regenesis. But his solutions  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:07):**  are firmly anti-farming. What are your chief fears about the approach that he's taken in  
**[0:18:12-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:12):**  the book?  
**[0:18:13-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:13):**  Well, my worry is that he has not made a distinction between different forms of agricultural systems.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:20):**  As I mentioned, there's the industrial food chain and the agri-ecological food webs. He  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:23):**  has to a certain extent, you know, he's talked about how small scale agroecology and small  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:27):**  and family farms are important, but excluded a huge amount of those that actually have  
**[0:18:32-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:32):**  livestock as part of their system.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:34):**  He seems to sort of mention them and then disregard them.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:36):**  Yeah, to disregard them, particularly because quite a few have livestock, you know, and  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:41):**  it's a really important part of many agri-ecological food systems. You know, stockless organic  
**[0:18:45-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:45):**  is very important and they're very interesting and wonderful stockless organic agri-ecological  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:52):**  farming systems. But there are also many, many where livestock plays an important role.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:18:56):**  And by discounting all of the livestock based farms, you're discounting a huge amount of  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:00):**  agri-ecological systems across the world. And in a sense, it's kind of said, well, neither  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:05):**  land sparing nor land sharing is good. Actually, the problem is farming. And that is a big  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:09):**  problem because it actually means that, you know, that's a real threat to livelihoods  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:14):**  across the world. You know, I want to mention the example of India, because I think that  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:19):**  is case in point where the perspective I'm coming from, I'm not talking so much from  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:23):**  the perspective of large dairy and beef and sheep farms here in the UK, which I think,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:29):**  you know, we need to see a reduction in quite a few of those. But, you know, I'm talking  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:33):**  about the livelihoods of millions and millions of small scale livestock producers around  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:37):**  the world. In India, 95 million people are dependent on small scale dairy. 75 million  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:43):**  of them are women. 15 million are landless people. And, you know, that's a huge amount  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:48):**  of livelihoods. And the average size of those herds is two to four cows. Yet India is the  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:53):**  largest dairy producer in the entire world. Most of that dairy production is default livestock  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:19:58):**  production, meaning it's very sustainable because the cows are fed on waste products.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:02):**  You know, they eat the leftover banana peels and the, you know, fodder that's leftover  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:06):**  from, you know, harvesting crops, you know, for their grains or, you know, the parts of  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:12):**  vegetables that people don't eat or waste fruit or whatever it is. And then they produce  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:16):**  milk, largely hand milk, and farmers get a really good price for that production. Now,  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:21):**  if you try and say that that is an inefficient system, or that livestock production is bad,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:26):**  and that needs to be replaced by something else, it could be replaced by something like  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:30):**  precision fermentation of a powdered substance very much like milk. And that's actually what's  
**[0:20:36-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:36):**  already happening, you know, or, you know, Europe is exporting milk to places in the  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:41):**  form of powdered milk, and that comes in at a very cheap price. And that undercuts the  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:46):**  livelihoods of farmers that are very dependent on that small scale dairy rearing for their,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:51):**  you know, well, basic food and nutrition security on a community and household level, but also,  
**[0:20:56-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:56):**  you know, for their entire livelihoods.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:20:57):**  And of course, it's still milk.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:00):**  And yeah, that's still milk. But if it's like precision fermentation producing a powder  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:04):**  that can be reconstituted into something like milk, that's even more of a threat to those  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:09):**  those livelihoods. And those narratives moving forward that casts one thing is quite bad  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:13):**  without the subtlety that actually distinguishes between different forms of systems is quite  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:18):**  dangerous because it means those promoting those technologies will steam ahead, get the  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:23):**  research and development grants be able to get the support of the technicians that go  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:28):**  out there for food and from the Food and Agriculture Organization be more privy to be able to get  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:32):**  the loans that are available from the World Bank and the IMF, which caused tremendous  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:36):**  difficulties in in the global south, you know, whenever there's, you know, big shifts in  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:42):**  the trajectories of where people go, and it means lots of people are left without the  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:45):**  livelihood. You can say just transition, just transition. But actually, there's there's  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:49):**  distortions in that just transition. Because if you tried to take on 95 million of those  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:53):**  people that are gaining a living living from small scale dairy and transition into another  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:21:58):**  sector of the economy, what sector is there that could absorb it if it's not a land based  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:03):**  one, a labor intensive land based livelihood, which in general is more sustainable, you  
**[0:22:07-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:07):**  tend to have low consumer consumer spending, etc. And you move people into cities or into  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:13):**  occupations that are computer programming or working for a tourism company, or whatever  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:19):**  it is, or living in dire poverty and slums, then what happens to the environmental impact  
**[0:22:23-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:23):**  of their lifestyles. And I think it's much more about bringing people back to the land,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:27):**  keeping people on the land, and building up the quality of those rural lifestyles.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:31):**  I agree with you completely. And I think the narrative that we're discussing here, the  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:35):**  narrative that George Monbiot presents is, is truly dangerous, because it does undermine  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:39):**  these various different things. And you say that, you know, George isn't, I mean, he says  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:43):**  himself that he's not land sharing or land sparing, but actually, I don't think that's  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:47):**  true. I think that he is clearly one of the world's big land sparers. Everything that  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:52):**  he says seems to be driven by this desire for land sparing, which because that is based  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:22:58):**  around this notion of resource efficiency, a disregarding of livestock, because there's  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:03):**  a misunderstanding in the first instance of the role of methane and how that works in  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:08):**  terms of global warming. But because it puts resource efficiency as the key metric over  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:14):**  and above so many others and disregards the ecosystem services that farming can deliver  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:20):**  and that livestock farming, you know, is part of delivering. And I wonder if you think that  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:25):**  Monbiot understands that in taking this position around precision fermentation and cultured  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:32):**  meat, even with the safeguards he suggests, such as open source technology, which frankly  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:36):**  are highly unlikely to happen, does he understand that he's really becoming corporate America's  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:40):**  new best friend?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:41):**  I'm not sure. I think he believes that you can put these things out there and it could  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:47):**  be. My experience is that it is quite unlikely. You know, and I did when I read his book,  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:53):**  I read the chapter that's about farm free foods first because of the headlines that  
**[0:23:59-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:23:59):**  are in the press, because the narrative going around social media and that kind of set the  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:03):**  tone before I went back and read all the part that supports small scale agroecology and  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:08):**  that kind of thing. I was reading it on the train on the way to a meeting with cultured  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:12):**  meat scientists. And I know George is largely talking about precision fermentation rather  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:16):**  than cultured meat. You know, he says we're going to have a hybrid of both. And I do believe  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:20):**  that the money that's going to go into developing these technologies is largely going to come  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:25):**  from the corporate sector because we're getting very little public investment or any solutions  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:30):**  coming forward with agriculture. But when I went to this meeting, I had a bit of an  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:33):**  open mind and I was actually frankly shocked at how little control there seemed to be over  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:37):**  there about who's investing and how there was very little talk about ownership of that  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:42):**  technology. And the main investors were very large corporations that we saw a slide of  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:47):**  the top 10 investors, which governments are proud of showing us, which were all the really  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:53):**  big, the really big corporations which control our food system.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:24:57):**  And groups like Tyson Food that are currently, you know, a big feedlot meats company. And  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:02):**  it's them, you know, and others in Cargill who are investing in precision fermentation  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:06):**  and cultured meat. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's what I saw. And  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:10):**  also that there was a tremendous amount of lobbying that went into the legislation to  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:15):**  try and not label gene edited foods as gene edited or genetically modified because they  
**[0:25:21-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:21):**  were worried that would affect the reputation of cultured meat. They wanted to leave the  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:24):**  doors firmly open for that to be a way for that food to be produced. And because the  
**[0:25:28-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:28):**  public generally pushes back against that kind of thing, they wanted to make sure it  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:31):**  wasn't labeled. And I found that quite dangerous as well, just to understand the amount of  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:36):**  corporate lobbying that's involved in the development of these sorts of technologies  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:40):**  basically made me worry that it's too utopian to think that they will be open source and  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:45):**  not lead towards more corporate control in the food sector. But more than that, it's  
**[0:25:50-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:50):**  about the trajectory towards disconnection to where our food comes from.  
**[0:25:53-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:53):**  And that's the point I wanted to bring up, you know, next really, because when George  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:25:57):**  talks about farm free foods and, you know, when we take that to its sort of logical final  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:02):**  resting place, and we start to imagine a world without farming, you know, whether that's  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:07):**  the UK or whether it's the developing world, farming and agriculture have been under enormous  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:12):**  pressure, economic pressure for many, many years and the countryside and countryside  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:16):**  economies and countryside societies and communities already aren't what they were, you know, 40,  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:21):**  50 years ago. But the idea that we remove farming entirely, what's left there? Who's  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:27):**  going to manage the countryside? How are these sort of really important pockets of national  
**[0:26:32-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:32):**  economies going to work? And I just, I get the impression that it's an ideological thrusting  
**[0:26:38-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:38):**  narrative that just hasn't been thought through in terms even of the things that George Monbiot,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:44):**  you know, would talk about in other columns, the importance of society, the importance  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:48):**  of community.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:49):**  Yeah. And I think the importance of community can't be underestimated and how much working  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:53):**  in connection with your local landscape lends to that. And, you know, having communities  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:26:58):**  that are centred around agriculture or food forests or connection to nature are incredibly  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:03):**  important to our social wellbeing, you know, that working together, that knowing where  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:07):**  things come from, eating together, working together on the land, it's all extremely important  
**[0:27:12-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:12):**  to, you know, how we move forward to solve social crises alongside the environmental  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:19):**  crisis. What I think is incredibly important is that we think about balance here, because,  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:24):**  you know, we talked about yield and that yield isn't the central thing, but yield is also  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:28):**  important. But what's most important is that we balance our land uses. And I think that  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:33):**  balance across the board is something we're severely lacking within the agroecology movement,  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:38):**  within the nation as a whole, with the planet as a whole, in trying to balance how we use  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:43):**  land better. So it's not necessarily about the yield per hectare, but it's how we balance  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:47):**  those various land uses. And we do need to improve yields in agroecology, but also sometimes  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:53):**  an extensive system can be very valuable. For instance, livestock that graze on a conservation  
**[0:27:58-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:27:58):**  meadow, that's very extensive, but we want the biodiversity that's on that conservation  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:01):**  meadow. It can be an important part of the heritage of a local landscape. Yet when we've  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:07):**  been looking at modelling land use to look at a balanced land use scenario, overall,  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:12):**  if we're going to use agroecological approaches to our food production and feed everybody  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:17):**  in the UK, we need to decrease the amount of meat by two thirds within that system.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:23):**  Right. So, so, but it still has a valuable role for livestock, but it's thinking about  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:28):**  the overall balance. And it's also thinking about where we produce our food.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:31):**  Toby  
**[0:28:24-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:24):**  Often we talk about the reduction in meat, but for me, that's about taking a land first  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:36):**  approach. If you take a land first approach, we will by default be producing a lot less  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:41):**  intensive chicken. We'll be getting rid of intensive pork, but there may well be a redistribution  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:46):**  of livestock of cattle and sheep across the country from the West to the East as we, as  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:51):**  we sort of try and embody and scale up these agroecological systems because livestock are  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:28:56):**  important in those rotations. And of course, regenerative agriculture is a way of boosting  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:01):**  production. And when we're talking about yield, we need to think about yield in terms, not  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:07):**  only of food, but in terms of climate outcomes, in terms of biodiversity outcomes, in terms  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:12):**  of social outcomes. So we're improving the yield of all of these various different things,  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:16):**  which is where things like the whole farm metric come in as well.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:20):**  Now, you mentioned earlier the disconnect between people who live in the city and people  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:25):**  who live in the countryside. And one of Mambio's understandable concerns is the expansion of  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:29):**  city populations and the ability to get affordable nutrition to those living in poorer communities.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:35):**  Now, there's no doubt that this is extremely important, but surely there are better ways  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:40):**  of giving city populations, rather than corporations, power and agency over the nutritional choices  
**[0:29:46-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:46):**  that they make.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:47):**  Yeah, I think an important solution is peri-urban agriculture and also thinking, you know, about  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:53):**  how we get greater connection for people who live in cities with the countryside. Peri-urban  
**[0:29:59-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:29:59):**  agriculture is the land that's around cities. You know, it's the kind of outskirts of cities,  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:05):**  if you think like the donut surrounding a city. And then there's also urban agriculture,  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:10):**  which is right in the middle of the city. And I think there's an important role for  
**[0:30:13-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:13):**  both. So in the middle of a city, having green space and a place where people can connect  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:17):**  with growing your salad greens and your herbs and, you know, and those quite, you know,  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:23):**  healthy, nutritious, fresh foods that you can add to a larger diet is incredibly important  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:29):**  because it gets people in contact with where their food comes in and gets them physical  
**[0:30:32-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:32):**  work in green space and that mental wellbeing of being a part of the community that works  
**[0:30:36-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:36):**  on an urban farm.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:37):**  And just to be clear, that's not high tech vertical production of lettuce?  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:41):**  No, no, no. It's people actually being involved, you know, with their hands in the soil a little  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:45):**  bit because that connection with the soil and the connection of working with other people  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:49):**  to be able to produce seasonal greens and things like that, that you can add to your  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:53):**  diet is incredibly important. And, you know, there's city farms that we work with in the  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:30:58):**  Landworkers Alliance that show that there's a real connection between healthy diets and,  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:03):**  you know, being having access to an urban farm because people understand more about  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:08):**  seasonality of food and they get access to things that they might not be able to afford.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:12):**  But then we think about the peri-urban areas, then that's like a zone where we actually  
**[0:31:16-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:16):**  should be setting aside the best agricultural land for production so that, you know, the  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:22):**  fresh vegetables that need to go into that city are being produced in a way that they  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:25):**  can come in. Also your milk and things that need to be fresh. And then you move outwards  
**[0:31:30-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:30):**  from there to a regional level where you've got farms, mixed farms that are operating  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:34):**  on a regional level to provide your arable crops, you know, and your meat and your other  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:39):**  things that you put into part of that diet. Really exciting thing about peri-urban agriculture  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:44):**  and urban agriculture is that you can actually produce a lot more culturally appropriate  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:48):**  food and you can have communities in very diverse neighbourhoods being connected to  
**[0:31:53-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:31:53):**  land and how the produce from there is produced, like what it is, what types of food it is,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:00):**  and how it's butchered. So, you know, if it's a farm producing halal meat, for example,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:05):**  you know, then it can be slaughtered in a way that's appropriate and butchered so that  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:08):**  you can use all parts of the animal within a certain diet, you know, so that it's culturally  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:12):**  appropriate as well. Or you can grow different vegetables or I know, you know, amazing farms  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:16):**  where they produce slaughter-free dairy products for the Hindu community. You know, it provides  
**[0:32:20-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:20):**  that diversity and that connection.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:22):**  It's such a different vision from Regenesis. And wouldn't it be amazing if George Monbiot  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:27):**  wrote that book? Because that's inclusive and people-centred. It's not focused on high  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:33):**  tech and high corporation input. Now, the core flaw in the book, it seems to me, is  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:39):**  that Monbiot seems to have twigged at last that the obvious extension of land sparing  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:44):**  is that agriculture is forced into ever smaller and more intensively managed spaces. And his  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:49):**  response in Regenesis quite rightly is to say, well, hang on, this won't work. But rather  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:54):**  than turning away from land sparing and everything that goes with it, the carbon tunnel vision  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:32:59):**  element and turning it towards widespread agroecology in multi-outcome land use, he's  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:04):**  so caught up in this sparing mindset that his solution is just to say, well, in that  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:09):**  case, we can't have farming at all. Why? When all of the evidence demonstrates the power  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:15):**  of multi-outcome land use, of people-centred agriculture, has Monbiot set out his stall  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:21):**  against it?  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:22):**  Well, he leaves space in there in his book for high yielding agroecological solutions,  
**[0:33:27-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:27):**  but stockless ones. So the farms like Ian Tolhurst's amazing farm with stockless organic  
**[0:33:35-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:35):**  rotations, we need to move forward with that. And I do agree, we need to move forward with  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:38):**  trying to get support for small farms producing high yields of agroecology. What he's missing  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:44):**  is that support for the default livestock is part of it as well, that there still is  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:48):**  a role for default livestock in this system that we move forward with. There is no doubt  
**[0:33:53-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:53):**  we need to take a good hard look at both land sharing and land sparing and find a balance  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:33:59):**  in between the two. We need to look at our land usage and we need to make sure that we  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:04):**  have livestock in the right place and in the right amount, decreasing the overall amount.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:09):**  But I would say the solutions to that are getting rid of factory farmed meat completely,  
**[0:34:15-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:15):**  get rid of the vertically integrated poultry farms, pork factories producing intensive  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:21):**  pork. We should actually be banning them as a society, stop the imports of soya from places  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:27):**  like the Amazon and really transition workers in that agri-food chain for factory farms  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:32):**  completely out of that type of farming into much more sustainable farming. But we also  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:38):**  have a role for livestock and we also need to look at the very large farms that are using  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:42):**  far more share of land. And that's where he talks about some of these  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:46):**  agri-ecological solutions are yield blind is that these very large plots of pasture  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:52):**  fed beef and lamb, I can understand they need to diversify and to think about land sharing  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:34:57):**  as well in terms of sharing that land for other usages so that people that are woodland  
**[0:35:02-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:02):**  workers who want to work forests to be able to produce timber and fuel wood, they also  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:09):**  have employment so that people growing vegetables have space for employment so that they're  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:13):**  using it so that it's part of mixed farming systems. So we're producing loads of other  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:17):**  things as well. That land sharing in that sense is also incredibly important. And we  
**[0:35:22-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:22):**  need to make sure we're doing our very best within the agri-ecological movement to have  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:25):**  a balanced scenario that we're putting forward so that we are really coming up with this  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:29):**  vision that's fair across the entire planet. When you talk about the way that we need to  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:33):**  have a balance between land sharing and land sparing, I mean, I would agree with you in  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:37):**  general terms, you know, clearly we need to have nature reserves and national parks, we  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:42):**  need to have the Amazon rainforests. But actually, when you talk about this sort of notion of  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:47):**  default livestock, you know, which I would think of in terms of default agri-ecology,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:52):**  it's a question of when we've got those big reserves, it's what we do with the rest of  
**[0:35:57-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:35:57):**  the land. And it's making sure that we find the best multi outcome solutions, that we  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:03):**  are valuing the power of soil to sequester as well as trees, that we're integrating trees  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:09):**  within agriculture and making sure that we're farming in a way that holds as much carbon  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:14):**  as possible because it is being shown that soil when it is well managed in a regenerative  
**[0:36:20-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:20):**  manner can hold and sequester as much carbon as your basic standard woodland in the UK,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:27):**  not a sickness, Bruce woodland, but your standard piece of woodland. And it's really important  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:31):**  to start building that into the models as well. You know, ultimately, what excites me  
**[0:36:35-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:35):**  about agri-ecology is that it's about putting land first, producing what that land and community  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:42):**  is able to support for itself. George just seems to have swallowed the Bill Gates land  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:47):**  sparing corporate fake food Kool-Aid and yet depressingly has this great big platform and  
**[0:36:53-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:53):**  a vast number of followers. And it just, I wonder how you think as someone who knows  
**[0:36:58-0:37:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:36:58):**  him as a friend, that we can start to bring him back. You know, why has he gone off piste  
**[0:37:02-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:02):**  to this sort of eco modernist world that he now inhabits? How can we bring him back to  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:08):**  show him that agri-ecology is actually the best hope for humanity and this planet's future?  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:14):**  Well, I think what we need to do is have a good balanced conversation on moving forward  
**[0:37:19-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:19):**  with the part of the scenario that isn't about precision fermentation and cultured meat and  
**[0:37:24-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:24):**  those techno fix solutions and focusing on the part where he talks about, let's improve  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:30):**  high yielding agri-ecological land use. Let's support small and family farms and try and  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:35):**  get them the research and development money that they need and shape that a bit more.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:39):**  Try and bring small scale default livestock scenarios into that scenario, but also unpick  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:45):**  more of what we want to move forward with the stock-free organics. You know, think about  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:49):**  our land use scenarios so that we get some balanced modelling projections about, you  
**[0:37:54-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:54):**  know, how much woodland do we want? How much conservation meadow do we want? How much arable  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:37:59):**  production with rotations do we want? How much, you know, food can we get from default  
**[0:38:04-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:04):**  livestock production? You know, how do we get to the level of fruit and veg production  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:07):**  that we need and unpick that and lay out a plan. Let's all think about this in a balanced  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:13):**  way together so that we can have good concrete evidence about the possibility that this is  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:19):**  possible. It is possible to actually share the land with all this multifunctional land  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:24):**  use for local communities to be able to feed ourselves in the future.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:27):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:38:27-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:27):**  So it's sort of a land use framework.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:28):**  Anna Hutt,  
**[0:38:28-0:38:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:28):**  Yeah. And I think, and I think if we started to like see how that works alongside the recommendation  
**[0:38:33-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:33):**  he made for improving high yielding agri-ecological solutions, that might start to convince him  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:41):**  that we could actually have a viable future moving this forward.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:43):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:43):**  It's interesting, isn't it? Because there is such a strong narrative towards the only  
**[0:38:49-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:49):**  way to solve environmental issues is to be vegan, is to be vegetarian. And there is an  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:53):**  urgent need for a counter narrative. And I'm interested in the way that you frame it because,  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:38:58):**  you know, much as George Monbiot sort of almost deliberately sets himself up as a, as a pantomime  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:04):**  villain in this space, through this book in promoting things like precision fermentation  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:09):**  over farming, that you think that it's about finding compromise, which is the way that,  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:14):**  you know, we always try and approach a whole range of different issues in society. It's  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:19):**  about ignoring the bad as much as possible, and then trying to find the middle ground  
**[0:39:25-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:25):**  and gradually broaden that middle ground so that there's more of a shared understanding.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:28):**  Anna Hutt,  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:28):**  Yeah, absolutely. It's about building community. And it's about all of us working together  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:33):**  as a community, as a social movement to move this forward. And that involves a great deal  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:38):**  of self reflection. You know, I spoke before about the National Farmers Union and Canada  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:42):**  being in the same movement as the indigenous people in the Amazon, and you know, small  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:46):**  farmers all across the world, and us as a movement reflect all the time, you know, now  
**[0:39:50-0:39:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:50):**  when a member of National Farmers Union, Canada has the platform, and they speak, first they  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:39:56):**  give respect to the indigenous people whose land that they took, and that they stood on  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regeneration--not-Regenesis-e1nr5oh#t=0:40:00):**  who were the indigenous communities that own that land before they set up the farms that

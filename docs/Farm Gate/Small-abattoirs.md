### Farm Gate  (Fri, 30 Sep 2022 07:09:21)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Kustein, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:09):**  of the Food and Global Security Network. Small abattoirs are essential infrastructure. Whether  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:15):**  you're an agro-ecological farmer bringing your livestock to market, a customer wanting  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:19):**  locally produced higher-welfare meat and dairy, or an environmentalist searching for solutions  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:24):**  to the ecological crises we all face. Sadly, small abattoirs are in serious decline, seen  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:30):**  by government as a nice-to-have that serves the middle classes, rather than a must-have  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:35):**  to help deliver good climate, biodiversity and soil security outcomes and to support  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:40):**  rural economies and farming communities. Another nail was recently hammered into the small  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:45):**  abattoir coffin as Metric's abattoir in Glossop closed for business. In this programme, I  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:50):**  talk to John Metric, Master Butcher and Chairman of the Abattoir Sector Group, Simon Docherty,  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:00:55):**  a former President of the British Veterinary Association, and Hannah Thorogood, an agro-ecological  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:00):**  livestock farmer based in Lincolnshire. Welcome all. John, what happened? Why have you had  
**[0:01:05-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:05):**  to close Metric's abattoir? I think the basic reason is staff shortages, in that we lost  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:12):**  a main slaughterman and two butchers within a very short period of time, which didn't  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:17):**  really give us a choice because if we moved a butcher into the abattoir, then we're shorter  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:22):**  butchers. And if we kept going like with the abattoir, then we didn't have the butchers  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:27):**  to butcher the meat. So that's what's happened. It was caused, well, the initial catalyst  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:33):**  for this was that we had an inexperienced OB, a official veterinarian in the abattoir,  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:40):**  who unfortunately made some errors with their interpretation of regulation and overstretched  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:45):**  their authority in the plant. And this caused the slaughterman to walk out. And although  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:50):**  I had apologies from both the Evil and Jones, who were the contractors for the Food Standards  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:01:55):**  Agency and also from the Food Standards Agency themselves, this particular employee decided  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:01):**  that he didn't want the scrutiny that he was under anymore with inexperienced people overseeing  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:07):**  what his work. And also the fact that he obviously had things like CCTV, measuring the stuns  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:14):**  and the cloud, which is all fair enough for due diligence. Well, add to that an inexperienced  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:19):**  OB over his shoulder while he's doing his work, he just decided he no longer wanted  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:23):**  to carry on in the trade. And unfortunately, two butchers followed him. So a sad situation,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:30):**  but something that's really been forced on us and something that we've been highlighting  
**[0:02:35-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:35):**  to the Food Standards Agency for a long time. We'd rather have an experienced OB in there  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:41):**  than inexperienced, but I'm afraid COVID and Brexit have meant that 70% of the OVs that  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:47):**  are employed by Evil and Jones are apparently new employees. We ended up with full veterinary  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:53):**  attendance because we upped the numbers that we were doing through COVID and we fell into  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:02:59):**  a bracket, which meant that they wanted full OB presence and full OB inexperienced presence  
**[0:03:05-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:05):**  has tipped us over the edge.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:06):**  John, we're going to come on to the OB issue a bit later in a bit more detail, because  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:11):**  we've got Simon here to sort of talk around the role of an official veterinarian and you  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:15):**  know what they do. But within both elements of your answer there, there was the issue  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:20):**  over staff, whether it's trying to recruit good OVs or trying to recruit slaughtermen.  
**[0:03:25-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:25):**  Now, we've heard this a lot that it's difficult to get staff for slaughterhouses, whether  
**[0:03:30-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:30):**  large or small. Has that always been your experience?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:33):**  We've been very fortunate in that we've actually managed to train local people up, you know,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:38):**  to be our slaughtermen. And the young lad who's left was an apprentice, you know, who  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:43):**  we trained up from scratch. So we haven't really been dependent on overseas labour.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:47):**  And it's tended to be farmers' sons who perhaps didn't have quite enough income on the farm,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:52):**  who would work in the abattoir part of the time, and then actually go back to work on  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:03:56):**  the farm. So it's not something, and certainly in our history, we've never encountered three  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:00):**  main cogs leaving at the same time. But it is something that's there in the industry.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:05):**  We know there's a great shortage of both abattoir workers and OVs.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:10):**  Now, when we're talking about abattoirs, there's, you know, there is a great variance. And if  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:14):**  I think of a large industrial scale slaughterhouse, like for example, the one at Merthyr Tydfil,  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:20):**  then perhaps I'm thinking of something which at least in my mind is open kind of 24-7.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:25):**  Small abattoirs, very different. What do we mean by a small abattoir? How is it defined?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:30):**  And how many hours a week are you open?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:32):**  Yeah, there are different definitions, Finn Lohan, that the basis of a small abattoir  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:37):**  is that they slaughter animals at the beginning of the week, and at the end of the week, they'll  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:40):**  have the meat prepared either for a retail operation or to supply them to farmers. So  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:46):**  the definition in the regulations is discontinuous slaughter. So they'll slaughter one, two,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:51):**  or three days a week. The rest of the week will be in preparation of products to add  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:04:55):**  value to the farmers' meat. So that's how they work. Now, the definition at the moment  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:00):**  that the UK government is using is a thousand livestock units. And to explain a livestock  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:06):**  unit would be one beast, six pigs, and 20 lambs, approximately. So that's the limit  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:11):**  at which they recognize small abattoirs. There have been other definitions. The 5% rule,  
**[0:05:17-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:17):**  which is used by some EU states, means that a small abattoir can be defined as a sector  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:25):**  that does less than 5% of national production. And that's something the abattoir sector  
**[0:05:29-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:29):**  group has been trying to get the government to actually recognize. And that would have  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:33):**  put our units up to 2,000 units, and we would have probably been able to have part-time  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:38):**  veterinary supervision, and we might have avoided what's happened. But that's gone  
**[0:05:43-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:43):**  now. And this thousand unit limit is what was brought in during COVID. The FSA did actually  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:50):**  average the units out over three years, you know, to try and take account of the COVID  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:55):**  effect. But unfortunately, we were still 10% over. And at the time, we talked to the FSA  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:05:59):**  about this, saying that obviously the COVID effect had lessened, and we thought we'd  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:03):**  be under 1,000 units. We were told that we'd have to have full OV supervision for a year  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:08):**  before it would be reviewed. And that has changed now, and the FSA actually would review  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:12):**  it. And they're even saying to us, obviously now, because you closed, if you reopened after  
**[0:06:16-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:16):**  Christmas, you'd definitely be under 1,000 units. Unfortunately, in business, it's not  
**[0:06:19-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:19):**  that easy to pick up and put down customers.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:22):**  That was my next question. Yeah. Are you able to reopen?  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:25):**  We're not at the moment. We haven't got the staff to do it. We're busy training up butchers  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:29):**  at the moment. We've got four apprentices who are undergoing intensive training. We've  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:34):**  got to look after the butcher aspect. First, I think the problem is that what we need is  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:38):**  this risk-based proportional regulation to create an environment where we can see succession  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:44):**  in the small-habitoire sector, where we can be confident that we can train young people  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:48):**  up again, and they're not going to be faced with the same problems that there is at the  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:52):**  moment in the sector.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:53):**  If you were over that limit, and that was part of the problem, and therefore became  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:06:58):**  defined as what? A large abattoir at that point, what was the impediment to just carrying  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:04):**  on, but as a larger abattoir?  
**[0:07:06-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:06):**  The problem is that because of the way the small abattoirs work, they work very differently  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:10):**  than large abattoirs. Large abattoirs are based on throughputs, where you've basically  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:15):**  got a line system and everybody's operating on that line. The idea is obviously to get  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:21):**  the job done as efficiently and as quickly as possible. The small abattoirs don't work  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:26):**  like that. I think the main problem for us is the fact that we've got a situation where  
**[0:07:32-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:32):**  we've got OVs coming into a small, compliant plant that was doing 1,300 units on cold inspection  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:39):**  in the middle of COVID, was doing approximately just over 1,000 units now, and yet we've got  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:44):**  double the amount of veterinary supervision. That is really the crux of this, is that we  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:49):**  haven't got this risk-based proportional system. You've got OVs who are extremely qualified  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:07:54):**  people doing menial tasks sometimes, tasks that if the regulation allowed could be delegated  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:00):**  to either the food business operator or a meat hygiene operative. That is not something  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:06):**  that's able to be done at the moment. The consequence of that is sometimes you can get  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:11):**  OVs who aren't experienced or who are over picky over the regulations, who don't understand  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:16):**  them or just downright bored because it's not a line system where the carcasses are  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:21):**  rattling through. They're basically twiddling their thumbs waiting for the next one. That's  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:25):**  not a good use of such an experienced resource. That's something we've been arguing for a  
**[0:08:30-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:30):**  while.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:31):**  Clearly this has had an impact on you and on your business and an emotional toll because  
**[0:08:36-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:36):**  the abattoir has been in your family for five generations. But what's the impact on the  
**[0:08:40-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:40):**  local community?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:41):**  I think the impact, I mean the first impact we've had to make sure is that obviously we're  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:46):**  still running as a business. We have a busy retail book to shop and bakery and online  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:50):**  and we just have to reassure our customers that we're still dealing with the same local  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:54):**  farmers. We still have a cutting room that's open but we're having to take carcass meat  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:08:59):**  in now. The farmers are taking to other small abattoirs to be processed and brought back  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:03):**  to us. So that's the first thing. So for the safety of our own business, we've really been  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:08):**  stressing that locally. Same meat, same farms, same process of butchering, same hanging,  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:15):**  everything like that. Having said that, I can't say that we haven't lost an element  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:18):**  of control because we have. But the main effect of the Closurist Abattoir is on the 200 small  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:23):**  livestock farmers who use that as a facility in order to get their meat from the farm to  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:30):**  the local customers. And they're the people who it's extremely difficult to deal with  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:34):**  because they're asking where they can go, you know, who will take my stock, who will  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:40):**  butcher them to the standard that you butcher to, who will add value to them and make them  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:43):**  into four kinds of sausages, three kinds of bacon, you know, to mean that kind of thing,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:47):**  which is what the farmers want. You know, they don't want something that's cut into  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:51):**  three pieces anymore. They want the actual value added product so that they can maximise  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:09:55):**  their returns. And obviously when the market turns down, you know, and prices are poor,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:00):**  you know, then obviously the small Abattoir is a good option for farmers and that they  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:05):**  don't have to take the ridiculous Sicily price that might be offered on the market, you know,  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:09):**  for all their hard work. They can actually take it to an Abattoir and realise some of  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:13):**  the margin that would ordinarily have been realised just by the retailer.  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:17):**  Well, we're joined by a farmer, Hannah Thoregood. And Hannah, you farm in a different part of  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:22):**  the country, but obviously you use small Abattoirs. Why are they so important for farmers like  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:29):**  yourself who sell direct to the public? What do they offer that larger Abattoirs don't?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:33):**  Yeah, it's a completely different experience. I think, as John was just saying there about  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:37):**  his 200 small farm customers, my heart really goes out to them because it could completely  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:43):**  ruin your business, your farm business to lose your Abattoir. I think one of the primary  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:49):**  things for me as a farmer is, and for so many farmers that use the small Abattoir, is that  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:54):**  we can really have confidence in a higher welfare for the animals. When you've got that  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:10:58):**  contact with the killman, you've got the contact with the person who's going to be doing the  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:02):**  work, you really know that you're taking them to something smaller, calmer, you know, it's  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:07):**  a much more positive experience, I believe. Another major part of it, I think, is the  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:11):**  fact that smaller Abattoirs are of course going to be closer to the farmers. So there's  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:17):**  a lower carbon emissions for the transportation of the animals to get there and back, lower  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:23):**  costs in transport. Of course, it comes back down to the stress on the animals as well  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:28):**  when you can make that journey into the minute. It's a completely different experience for  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:33):**  that animal than sometimes having to go hours to a nearby Abattoir or a good Abattoir. The  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:39):**  thing a small Abattoir can really provide is flexibility and farmers, that's invaluable  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:43):**  to farmers that we, you know, we have to move and sway with the climate, with the weather,  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:49):**  with the trends of the market. I can WhatsApp message my Abattoir, you know, one day and  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:54):**  get animals in just a couple of days later if I need to. That's a fantastic contact to  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:11:59):**  be able to have. It also allows us flexibility around what our customers want. You know,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:03):**  a lot of us small farmers are doing direct sales and so we can really work with the Abattoir.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:09):**  Our customers can be quite picky about what they want at the end of the day and small  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:14):**  Abattoirs have that flexibility that they can do that, make those different cuts, produce  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:19):**  at different times. You know, there's a lot of flexibility to be had.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:22):**  So that relationship between the farmer and the small Abattoir is a relationship that's  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:28):**  actually passed on down the chain, you know, through to the wholesalers that you may be  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:33):**  selling to, you know, for shops or to individual customers themselves. And when you talk about,  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:38):**  you know, taking your stock to market at a couple of days notice, taking them to the  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:42):**  Abattoir, those are unlikely to be full trailers, are they? They might just be one or two animals.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:46):**  Yeah, it can completely vary. We, you know, sometimes it's just one cow, one pig, you  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:51):**  know, a few lambs. Working with small Abattoirs, you can really work with the quantities that  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:12:56):**  you need and we can fit around each other as well. You know, there's a, it's a two way  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:00):**  streak because obviously Abattoirs have their very, very busy periods and we can communicate  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:05):**  with each other back and forth about when it's going to be best to work for both sides  
**[0:13:09-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:09):**  of it. I think the other side of it brings in that  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:11):**  kind of direct contact between the Abattoir and the farmer is that human connection. You  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:16):**  know, it can be a really isolating job being a farmer out in the field, struggling with  
**[0:13:20-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:20):**  the weather on different times and up against it in many, many different ways. And when  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:24):**  you go to your Abattoir and you know the person that you're dealing with, you know the person  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:28):**  at the end of the phone, you know, you know, it makes a massive difference I think to the  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:32):**  welfare of the farmer as well as the welfare of the animals to have that direct human contact.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:38):**  What you're describing there Hannah seems a world away from the sort of industrialised  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:43):**  food processes that so many of us are aware of. And clearly the government feels that  
**[0:13:49-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:49):**  small Abattoirs and local food are just an obsession of the middle classes, that your  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:53):**  customers are middle class customers and therefore if they want to pay a bit more for their  
**[0:13:57-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:13:57):**  meat they can pay a bit more and that will pay for the cost of the Abattoir. Where most  
**[0:14:02-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:02):**  people get their sausages and steaks from supermarkets linked to those big industrialised  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:05):**  slaughter units. Isn't there a degree to which that's true?  
**[0:14:10-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:10):**  I think there is a degree to which that's true, but I think there's also something to  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:13):**  look at what do we mean by the middle classes. And I think often when we're talking about  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:18):**  then that demographic, we hear about more of them because they're often the empowered,  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:23):**  educated, a little bit of disposable income so they can actually make a louder noise about  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:28):**  what they believe in and how they want to be eating, how they want to be consuming.  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:33):**  I think those folks who are slightly more aware of their food and have that slightly  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:38):**  more disposable income to be able to make those choices, of course they're going to  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:42):**  be the ones that are going to be going for the local food. However it's not representative  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:47):**  of all the customers at all. I think the thing that we really need to be very realistic about  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:51):**  is a local food network is the only way there is a future of food. The industrialised food  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:14:57):**  system is entirely dependent on low cost available fossil fuels. It's the only way we can have  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:03):**  an industrial system and as those fossil fuels get more and more expensive, as we start looking  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:07):**  at the energy crisis, the price of fuels going up. The only resilience that we have is on  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:12):**  small scale food networks and that's not just for the middle class, that's for everybody  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:16):**  to be able to access food.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:17):**  It seems to me that the government position is a very short term position. It's about  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:21):**  supplying the existing market rather than thinking about what that market will be or  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:27):**  should be in the future and therefore helping the infrastructure that we have now to remain  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:32):**  and growing new infrastructure so that we're building that more localised, that more secure  
**[0:15:38-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:38):**  market in the future Hannah.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:39):**  Yeah absolutely and I think what's happening now is a much better awareness of food with  
**[0:15:44-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:44):**  our youngsters. There's many more people asking questions. It's being taught in schools about  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:49):**  food choices and where food comes from so those are our consumers for tomorrow. We need  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:54):**  to make sure the infrastructure is in place so that when they're the ones that are going  
**[0:15:57-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:57):**  to be buying the food, everything is there ready for them.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:15:59):**  Simon you used to be the chairman of the Abattoir Sector Group before Jon and as a vet, I'm  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:05):**  just wondering if you could riff a little bit on some of the issues that we've been  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:09):**  covering. So Jon was starting to talk about a risk based system and the need for a risk  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:14):**  based system. He was talking about the role of the OV and I just wonder if you have any  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:18):**  immediate thoughts about things that Jon's been saying so far.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:22):**  Yeah so you're absolutely right. The Abattoir Sector Group was established what two and  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:27):**  a half years ago now and it was very much on the back of a number of reports that had  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:33):**  been written about the sector. I had the privilege I suppose during my time as an officer of  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:39):**  the British Veterinary Association to be involved with the All Party Parliamentary Group for  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:44):**  Animal Welfare report on the provision of small abattoirs and going into the future  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:50):**  and how they played a very important part as part of shortening supply chains and dealing  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:16:57):**  with some of the issues that you've heard about already in terms of reducing the distance  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:01):**  maybe animals are having to travel to local abattoirs, particularly in remote areas. Offering  
**[0:17:08-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:08):**  that choice as part of a sustainable network going forwards was something we felt was very  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:16):**  important. Let's be clear, some of the regulation that we've been talking about I think everyone  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:21):**  is content that we need some regulation in the system. Regulation in itself will give  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:28):**  retailers and consumers an element of confidence in the product, in the domestic market and  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:34):**  certainly when we're looking at export trade arrangements and looking at export markets  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:40):**  they're providing a degree of confidence there as well.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:43):**  And Simon, I'm sorry to cut you off but at the same time I just want to go into that  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:46):**  regulation thing in slightly more detail because I think actually there's a historical context  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:51):**  there which is quite important because looking back to the 1980s there was clearly a wide  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:17:55):**  variance in terms of abattoir standards. For example in terms of environmental health and  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:00):**  welfare outcomes. So before we think about how the regulation might change in the future  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:06):**  could you give us a bit of a context why that regulation was changed and tightened in the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:10):**  first place and what impact that had?  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:12):**  Yeah, so certainly I mean I think you know we're now in 2022 so in that intervening sort  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:17):**  of 40 year period we've known, we understand an awful lot more and I'll give you a couple  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:24):**  of examples. We now know much more about the physiology of that conversion of muscle into  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:31):**  meat and we know that reducing stress on the animals during transport, coming into the  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:37):**  leverage, allowing them to settle, good handling in the slaughter line right up to the point  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:44):**  of stunning and then kill means that you will end up with a better product at the end of  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:49):**  the day. An animal that's really stressed coming in you'll tend to end up with meat  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:54):**  that's quite tough and you know certainly in terms of beef you know there's a likelihood,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:18:59):**  a higher likelihood of ending up with what's called dark firm dry meat and then in terms  
**[0:19:04-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:04):**  then of you know in terms of pork you can end up with something that's called pale soft  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:11):**  and exudative and where animals are sort of highly stressed. So we now know there is a  
**[0:19:16-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:16):**  direct link between welfare and the quality of the product. Taking that a step further  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:22):**  and you know and that's why you know you've heard from from John and from Hannah as to  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:27):**  why the small abattoir can offer a really good solution around you know improved welfare  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:32):**  of being able to bring that small group of animals in, settle them quite quickly and  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:37):**  get them get them onto the line. There's also then elements related to food safety and there's  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:43):**  no doubt again going back to the 1980s into the 1990s you know mid 1980s was when we were  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:50):**  first discovering BSE. Although it is likely that there were probably cases of BSE that  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:19:55):**  went back into the late 70s and then going through into the 1990s or some very high profile  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:00):**  cases around things like E.coli O157 and Compilobacter and so on. So look in that intervening period  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:07):**  I think there has been a fantastic shift within the abattoir and a lot of that was achieved  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:15):**  quite rightly by vets working with abattoir operators and working with meat hygiene inspectors  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:21):**  meeting, working with other abattoir staff through appropriate levels of education and  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:27):**  training and improvement to look at hygiene, to look at animal welfare, look at animal  
**[0:20:32-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:32):**  health and there is to meet that expectation of the big retailers, the smaller retailers,  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:40):**  all of the supply chains and ultimately the consumer that we have been improving animal  
**[0:20:45-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:45):**  health and welfare in our meat production but also then improving hygiene and food safety  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:52):**  along the way as well.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:53):**  So if we were to start thinking about some of the issues that John raised earlier on  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:20:58):**  around there not being enough of a risk-based approach, around the role of OVs and the way  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:04):**  in which OVs can provide a really good experience for the people working in that small abattoir  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:09):**  if they are working with them or can just be pains in the backside. So I just wonder  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:13):**  how we address some of those issues in the future.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:16):**  Yeah, and look any regulation, I think one of the sort of buzz words at the minute is  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:22):**  proportionate and dynamic. So it is taking the rule book and applying it appropriately.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:28):**  It needs to be fair, it needs to be equitable, it does need to be dynamic, it needs to be  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:33):**  proportionate, it needs to be risk-based. And I think that is where you end up making  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:38):**  the best use of the expertise that is available. So as John said, rather than just having this  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:44):**  kind of arbitrary cut off that whenever you go over a certain number of animals you have  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:48):**  to fill out full-time OV provision. That means that in effect you have a qualified vet at  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:21:54):**  a time when we have a shortage of vets across the country, you have a qualified vet spending  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:00):**  a lot of time in the abattoir that they don't really need to be there. It is important certainly  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:05):**  that they are there to do the anti-mortem inspection, to see the animals coming in,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:10):**  to see if there is any signs, look at the cleanliness of the animals coming into the  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:13):**  abattoir, look at the welfare, make sure there is no injuries. That is a really critical  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:19):**  part. The role of the OV goes right through to supporting the meat hygiene operation as  
**[0:22:25-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:25):**  well. So looking for aspects and supporting the function of the meat hygiene inspectors  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:31):**  in that. But again, technology has moved on. We have all sorts of sensor technology now  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:36):**  available to support the work of the vet and the meat hygiene inspector. We have the ability  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:42):**  to do, as John mentioned, we have the ability to do cold inspections. So where we can do  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:47):**  some of that inspection, maybe the following day or two days later, that is also possible.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:54):**  So it is making the best use of that.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:22:56):**  So you are suggesting that the OV may not need to be there at all at the point of slaughter.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:01):**  That actually they could be there a couple of days afterwards inspecting the meat?  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:04):**  Yeah, I mean certainly in terms of being there at the point of slaughter, I think there is  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:09):**  general agreement again that from the point of view of having a degree of oversight of  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:13):**  that. John mentioned the fact that, you know, that abattoirs have CCTV now. I mean the CCTV  
**[0:23:19-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:19):**  was installed very much as an adjunct alongside the vet and re-presence. And certainly I don't  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:26):**  think what we are talking about here is completely removing vets from abattoirs at the point  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:30):**  of slaughter. But do they need to watch every single animal? I mean certainly there are  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:34):**  other ways now of monitoring the effectiveness of stunning and monitoring the time to kill  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:40):**  and ensuring that welfare outcomes are met in that respect.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:44):**  And so for example, could technology do that? I mean if you've got a vet, for example, that's  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:50):**  behind a bank of monitors where they're working with a number of small slaughterhouses rather  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:23:57):**  than simply one where there are algorithms that pick up changes in sound levels, for  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:02):**  example, that can monitor the amount of time taken for an individual animal to get from  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:08):**  the point of stunning to the point where they're hanging. Is that a possibility or are we still  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:13):**  a step away from that?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:14):**  Yeah, I think we're still a step back from that, okay. You know, I think that technology  
**[0:24:19-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:19):**  can be developed, but there needs to be an incentive for that innovation. And that's  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:26):**  something that the Abattoir Sector Group has been calling for. And we've been looking at  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:31):**  where there can be more research carried out in that. And as I say, it's not all about  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:36):**  replacing vets and abattoirs at this point in time. And I think there's general agreement  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:40):**  on that.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:41):**  Certainly vets will always require a bit of time to catch up on a bit of paperwork in  
**[0:24:45-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:45):**  their office, but where there is just a need to have a vet there, you know, just arbitrarily,  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:52):**  there's no real fulfillment for the vet. You know, we don't spend five years in vet school,  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:24:56):**  plus X amount of time doing extra training to become an official veterinarian, to then  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:02):**  set about, as John said, you know, sometimes it is twiddling their thumbs. Vets, yeah,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:08):**  I mean, absolutely. Antimortem inspection, point of slaughter, post-mortem, potentially  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:14):**  cold inspection at a different time. But that will generate a bit of flexibility in the  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:19):**  system that they don't necessarily need to be there for the full time. And I think that's  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:25):**  what we want to be working towards, rather than just having these kind of arbitrary situations  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:30):**  where yes, you know, once you go over a certain number, you're obliged to have a vet there  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:36):**  full time. As John said, the workflow is very different. I mean, having a vet there all  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:40):**  the time in a high throughput abattoir makes absolute sense because there are constantly  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:45):**  animals coming in, there are constantly animals being killed, there's constantly meat inspection  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:50):**  to be done, you know, as part of that high throughput. But in that situation that John  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:55):**  was describing, where maybe the, you know, the animals are coming in Monday, Tuesday,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:25:59):**  they're maybe killed Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, do we have to then have a vet there on Friday  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:06):**  or Saturday or whatever, you know, there are other ways of kind of doing that workflow  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:12):**  that will actually fit the needs of a small abattoir. We want vets doing veterinary work.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:17):**  We don't necessarily want vets hanging about because that's not, as I say, it's not fulfilling  
**[0:26:22-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:22):**  for the vet in terms of their career structure, career progression, satisfaction in the workplace.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:27):**  BVI, you know, the British Veterinary Association has been doing a huge amount of work about,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:31):**  you know, satisfaction of in the workplace, having a good workplace, what a good workplace  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:36):**  means. And it's not necessarily good for anybody to have a vet hanging about twiddling their  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:41):**  limbs, you know.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:42):**  John, when you were talking earlier, the OV seemed to be very much at the centre of the  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:47):**  story that you were telling about the closure of your abattoir. Do you like what you're  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:51):**  hearing from Simon there? Does that start to address some of the problems that you were  
**[0:26:55-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:55):**  raising?  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:26:56):**  Obviously, I've worked with Simon a while, you know, to me, and I agree with what he  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:00):**  said, and he knows, you know, to me, what the situations and Simon's been given lots  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:04):**  of practical examples of things when they do go awry, as of the FSA and DEFRA. Yeah.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:10):**  So, you know, the vet has a crucial role in abattoirs. It's getting the right level of  
**[0:27:15-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:15):**  role for, you know, the risk and getting the proportionality of that attendance correct.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:22):**  But I think at the moment, one of the things that's worrying me more than anything is the  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:25):**  fact of the inexperience of vets that are coming in at the moment, who basically are  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:31):**  there because the regulation says we need a vet there, not necessarily that they have  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:36):**  the right experience. They're coming from countries all over the world, have different  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:40):**  systems. We're that short of them because of COVID and Brexit that their actual induction  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:47):**  has got shorter and shorter and shorter, and they're basically thrust straight into that  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:51):**  environment. And it's not very fair to them either. It would be much better to actually  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:27:55):**  amend the regulation and get some primary legislation in there so that we can determine  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:00):**  for our, as a country, you know, what the level of veterinary attendance needs to be  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:06):**  and how we measure that and how we safeguard animal welfare and food safety at the same  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:11):**  time. But we don't go over the top and we don't bring people in. I mean, at the moment,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:16):**  because of the shortage of vets, obviously there is a language requirement, you know,  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:20):**  that's been set, you know, and they can get a temporary permit, I think for six months,  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:25):**  you know, in which they've got to be able to pass this language exam. And if they don't  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:30):**  pass that language exam, then basically they have to leave. Well, this is like a, it's  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:34):**  like a conveyor belt, you know what I mean? So you basically got people who don't pass  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:38):**  the language requirement and then the next lot of vets come in. Now, my question to that  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:42):**  is how does that work for consistency? How does that work, you know what I mean, for  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:47):**  OVs to get the respect, you know, that they deserve because of the qualifications that  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:52):**  they've worked so hard to get? And the FSA know that, and they say that the one size  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:28:58):**  fits all regulation does not work, particularly for small abattoirs. They recognise that themselves.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:04):**  We're not, we're not saying stuff that the FSA doesn't, doesn't actually recognise, but  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:09):**  what we are saying is that we've pointed out the problems. We've actually unfortunately  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:14):**  got an example of what can happen, you know, where one of these problems isn't addressed  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:18):**  with my own business, but what's actually happening on the ground? What is actually  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:22):**  going to change here that's going to make small abattoirs viable for the future?  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:27):**  So if the FSA, the Food Standards Agency, understands the problem to a large extent,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:32):**  it appreciates and accepts that, that, that, that there's something that needs to happen.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:36):**  What, what is the blocker? What's stopping this? Is it parliament? Is it Defra that's  
**[0:29:40-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:40):**  blocking, or is there something at some stage in the FSA?  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:43):**  I think there's this, there's several blocks. Obviously we've come out of the EU, we're  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:48):**  on this one size fits all and that's, you know, that's, that's, that's where we are  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:53):**  at the moment. Now, if we were to defer from that and to have like domestic regulation  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:29:57):**  and export regulation, then naturally the EU commission and other trade partners would  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:03):**  want to see a robust traceability system that could actually demonstrate that the, the,  
**[0:30:09-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:09):**  the domestic production is not entering exports. Yeah. And that is something I don't believe  
**[0:30:15-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:15):**  that we've actually got at the moment. And that's something that's really essential.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:19):**  And if we are going to diverge into domestic regulation, the domestic production, and we're  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:24):**  going to have export, then we need to be able to have a traceability system that will stand  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:28):**  up to scrutiny from those people. So that, that's one of the blocks. The other block  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:33):**  would be from industry itself, because obviously we've got some big players who are involved,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:37):**  you know, in a, in a, you know, a valuable export market and anything that rocks that  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:43):**  boat, you know, to mean by bringing other legislation, they obviously wouldn't support.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:48):**  And even like the medium, some of the medium sized abattoirs who are into export are nervous  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:53):**  of that. So I think it's really having the gumption really to, to get a traceability  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:30:58):**  system that stands up to scrutiny. I think that's the first thing, right the way through  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:02):**  from the animals themselves, right through to the animal byproducts at the end of production.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:07):**  We need that desperately. We need, I think, I think really we're, we're really calling  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:12):**  on the small livestock farmers who depend on small abattoirs for all of their living  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:18):**  or some of their living, you know, on their farms to actually put pressure on different  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:22):**  governments and say to them, look, we need these businesses here in the future. We need  
**[0:31:26-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:26):**  to be able to have a domestic system. We need local supply chains. Farmer, butcher, customer,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:32):**  you know, is a, is a good, short, traceable supply chain. And you should, and you should  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:37):**  be supporting that because I think both industry and government at a policy level in Defra  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:42):**  are nervous about changing anything. And obviously the point to the fact that, oh, it's a small  
**[0:31:47-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:47):**  sector. I think small abattoirs in 2021 did 1% of beef, you know, as a production, which  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:31:54):**  is obviously very low. But if you actually included the abattoirs between 1000 and 5000  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:00):**  units, which is still very small, then you're talking about 6%, you know, if you add the  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:05):**  two together. I mean, don't forget some pig abattoirs are doing between 25 and 30,000  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:10):**  pigs a week, you know what I mean? So, you know, something that's doing 5000 units a  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:15):**  year to me is still a small abattoir, even, even if the definition's not there.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:20):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:32:13-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:13):**  It's interesting because a lot of that seems to come down to prioritisation, that there's  
**[0:32:25-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:25):**  a general acceptance that things could be improved for small abattoirs, but there's  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:30):**  a competition in terms of policy development and the time that civil servants have. And  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:36):**  at the end of the day, the government seems pretty happy with the direction of travel.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:40):**  It believes that larger abattoirs deliver greater efficiency, cheaper killing, better  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:45):**  environmental and welfare quality, which comes back to that, you know, issue that we were  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:50):**  talking about earlier. Why is it that you think they're wrong and they should prioritise  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:55):**  this?  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:32:56):**  I think what we've seen is through various crises, whether they be an animal disease  
**[0:33:01-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:01):**  or diseases like COVID, you know what I mean? We've seen the small abattoirs actually  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:04):**  step up to the plate and increase production. We've seen them actually try and fill that  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:09):**  void, you know what I mean? And once they're there, they won't be able to do that. They  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:12):**  won't be able to support farmers, you know, when prices are low, you know, that they can  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:16):**  actually market their own meat. They're not going to be there anymore to do that. So this  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:20):**  is really to do with the resilience of the system that we've got. And really, do we  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:24):**  want to be just a lot of very, very big abattoirs with no local meat and with animals travelling  
**[0:33:30-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:30):**  further to slaughter? I mean, you know, I don't for a minute, you know, say that these  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:35):**  animals aren't transported, you know, to high animal welfare standards. They are. But, you  
**[0:33:41-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:41):**  know, there's nothing, I think the small abattoirs when we did a survey of 10 all over the country,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:45):**  they were travelling less than 35 miles to slaughter, 95% or above of their animals.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:51):**  Surely if we're talking about the environment, you know what I mean, and the transport of  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:33:55):**  animals and the carbon footprint of that small abattoirs are valuable from that point of  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:00):**  view. They're also valuable in that quite a few small abattoirs are processing animals  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:05):**  that are byproducts of environmental schemes as well. You know, it's land that's managed  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:10):**  for the environment and these are byproducts that are then turned into meat.  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:14):**  So this comes back to not reacting to the now but actually planning and developing the  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:20):**  infrastructure that we're going to need in the future. And you mentioned resilience there.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:24):**  I mean, and resilience to me, often it's about environmental resilience, climate resilience.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:29):**  But if we go back to the pandemic and we look across to the United States where they have,  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:33):**  you know, very, very large slaughterhouses, when there were outbreaks of COVID and those  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:38):**  slaughterhouses had to all but shut down, that created enormous problems for farmers  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:43):**  and whole food chains on the ground. It's very much putting all your eggs in one  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:47):**  basket isn't it? And you'd think that these situations that we've come across like would  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:51):**  make us wary of actually doing that. But it doesn't seem to be that way at the moment.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:34:56):**  Simon, just thinking about the OV issue in particular and anything else, I guess, that  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:01):**  the BVA would have a policy on. What is the BVA's position on this at the moment? Because  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:07):**  clearly it's a change in the role of the vet. Are they broadly supportive?  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:11):**  I think probably a good starting point is, you know, is recognition that animal health,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:16):**  animal welfare, food safety and even some of the human health and safety aspects in  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:23):**  the abattoir are all public goods. You know, that's the starting point when you're thinking  
**[0:35:27-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:27):**  about the role of a professional having some oversight of that. The other thing to remember  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:33):**  is that the official veterinarian, by very nature of the title, is representing government  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:39):**  and is representing the Food Standards Agency at that point of work.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:45):**  BVA's position is like, you know, over the last few years, we've put a huge amount of  
**[0:35:49-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:49):**  resource into developing our position around local sustainable food production. At times,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:35:56):**  you know, we've called on less and better to look at sort of higher quality, higher  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:02):**  welfare systems and how the UK veterinary profession can support that. We've developed  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:08):**  a position, a policy position around welfare at Slaughter. We have quite an extensive policy  
**[0:36:13-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:13):**  position on sustainable animal agriculture, which includes things around the provision  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:18):**  of transport to local abattoirs and shortening supply chains. But I think the important part  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:23):**  here is that when we're talking about changing the role of the OV, we're not talking about  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:29):**  completely reinventing the proverbial wheel. What we are trying to do is stop the proverbial  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:35):**  wheels coming off the cart, you know, because that's the point that we're getting to. We  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:39):**  have such a shortage of vets at the minute that there are times that the profession is  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:43):**  in a bit of a flat spin. And as John's talked about, you know, we're then relying on bringing  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:49):**  in inexperienced staff into those situations, which is not good for them or indeed the abattoir  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:54):**  operators or the owners. So I think what we're looking at doing then is sort of tweaking  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:36:59):**  the design and making sure that the wheels are turning effectively. And that's really  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:04):**  the point that we want to be getting to in terms of changing the role of the OV and the  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:08):**  abattoir. So as I touched on earlier on, BVA very much kind of wants to be part of that  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:14):**  conversation. We want to maximise, you know, from the point of anti-mortem inspection right  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:20):**  through to the point of meat inspection, we want to maximise the effectiveness of the  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:24):**  role of the vet and all of the moving parts, you know, along that way. It is about, you  
**[0:37:31-0:37:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:31):**  know, having that proportionate risk-based dynamic regulation that we were talking about.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:36):**  And I think there is an appetite for BVA to be part of that conversation because ultimately  
**[0:37:41-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:41):**  that's going to increase the fulfilment of working in veterinary public health, working  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:46):**  in the meat hygiene sector, which traditionally hasn't been a particularly popular job for  
**[0:37:52-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:52):**  UK graduates. But if you look at countries like New Zealand that have really professionalised  
**[0:37:59-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:37:59):**  the role of the official veterinarian and created a fulfilling career structure in veterinary  
**[0:38:05-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:05):**  public health, I think that is absolutely something we want to look to and it's absolutely  
**[0:38:11-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:11):**  something that BVA has an appetite to be involved in.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:13):**  Thanks so much. And Hannah, coming back to you, we touched on this a little earlier,  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:18):**  but many environmentalists now see small abattoirs as essential infrastructure in the race to  
**[0:38:24-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:24):**  combat global warming and biodiversity loss, this sort of broader crisis in nature. Why  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:30):**  do you think that is? How are small abattoirs linked to nature restoration?  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:34):**  I think it's quite an interesting perspective on it. And I think we've been through kind  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:38):**  of a dark few generations where people lost their connection to their food. You know,  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:42):**  not everybody, but an awful lot of people just got used to buying stuff from the supermarket  
**[0:38:46-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:46):**  and not really asking questions. And I think we're coming out of that now, that through  
**[0:38:50-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:50):**  a number of different experiences, and I think COVID also has a good thing to answer to this,  
**[0:38:55-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:55):**  that people realise when they were in lockdown, they really missed that connection to the  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:38:58):**  outside world, to greenery, to nature. And more and more people are really wanting to  
**[0:39:03-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:03):**  make that connection to nature. And it's not many steps from when you're making that connection  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:08):**  to nature that you start to think about the food, how we interact with an ecosystem, that  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:13):**  we're not these separate humans from nature over there. But we're entirely dependent and  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:18):**  part of a larger system, an ecosystem. And so then we start to think about our food and  
**[0:39:22-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:22):**  we start to think where does our food come from? Once we start to look at that, and we  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:26):**  look at the supermarkets and some of the kind of greenwash that we see on supermarket packaging  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:31):**  things, it's not long before people think, well, I don't really want to eat like that  
**[0:39:35-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:35):**  anymore. I want to know where my food's coming from. I want to know the story of the food.  
**[0:39:39-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:39):**  I want to know the connection to the growers and the farmers. An awful lot of people have  
**[0:39:43-0:39:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:43):**  started to grow a bit of their own food and think, wow, nothing tastes as good as a tomato  
**[0:39:48-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:48):**  that's fresh from the garden that you've grown from seed. And once you start to have those  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:53):**  realisations, you realise it kind of opens up your mind to all these different connections,  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:39:58):**  where your food's coming from, what kind of life is that animal having if you're choosing  
**[0:40:02-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:02):**  to eat anything animal based, what kind of life is the plant having, what's the farm  
**[0:40:06-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:06):**  like that it's growing on, what's the life of the farmer, what's the life of the grower?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:11):**  And I think there's more and more questions that are being asked. And once we start to  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:15):**  open our minds to all of that, the connections just keep on coming. And part of that so much  
**[0:40:21-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:21):**  is the idea of we don't want if we're people are eating an animal based diet, they don't  
**[0:40:26-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:26):**  want to be part of some big, scary looking industrialised process. They want to know  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:31):**  that that animal has been looked after from its conception through to its birth, through  
**[0:40:36-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:36):**  its life and through to its death at every single stage. And for me as a farmer, I take  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:42):**  that responsibility very seriously. I'm responsible for those animals from their conception, through  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:47):**  their gestation, through their life and right to their very last day, to their last minutes.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:51):**  And consumers are starting to realise that they want to have that connection to their  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:40:56):**  local abattoirs as well, to know that it's as happy an ending as it can be.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:00):**  Thanks for that. And I think it's not even just about greater awareness within that sort  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:06):**  of customer base, but it's a recognition even amongst people who are vegetarian and vegan,  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:12):**  but who care about the environment, that we need livestock in a rotation on a farm, no  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:18):**  matter what that farm is producing, because livestock are able to produce and to service  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:23):**  nutrients to cycle nutrients in a way that just wouldn't happen any other way without  
**[0:41:28-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:28):**  using chemicals. And so those stock obviously need to be part of a food chain in order to  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:34):**  be affordable for the farmer to keep them and for that system to be sustainable.  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:39):**  Yeah, absolutely. When we look at regenerative agricultural practices and we're looking at  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:43):**  the time-controlled grazing systems where the animals are moved on every day, as they  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:48):**  do here on our farm at the ink pot, then those animals are really responsible for sequestering  
**[0:41:53-0:41:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:53):**  huge amounts of carbon. There's no grain input through there. It really makes a difference.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:41:58):**  And there's a lot of people really realising what a positive impact that animals can have  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:02):**  on the environment, not this kind of worst case scenario that we hear from these large  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:06):**  industrialised processes.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:08):**  And following on from that, I wonder how important you think that the small abattoir infrastructure  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:13):**  is to the future success or failure of Britain's food security overall. Looking forward a decade.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:18):**  Yeah, I think again, we only just have to look at Covid where we saw those empty shelves  
**[0:42:24-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:24):**  to realise how very, very vulnerable our food system is. And it's not just been Covid, it's  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:28):**  been many other things since Brexit's not done us any favours with this. All sorts of  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:33):**  systems have started to kind of fall to pieces to show that these big last minute food supply  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:39):**  chain systems just really aren't working. They're not showing us any signs of resilience.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:44):**  So I think in order to have any sort of resilience in terms of a food system in the future, it  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:49):**  really does have to come down to local connections, small abattoirs, small growers, and working  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:55):**  directly with your community. I think an awful lot of people are waking up to the fact that  
**[0:42:59-0:43:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:42:59):**  food is coming from huge, vast distances across the planet. And we just can't do that. There's  
**[0:43:04-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:04):**  no future in a food like that. We really need to be looking at eating local, eating seasonal,  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:11):**  eating small scale and having that direct contact with your farmer who can then have  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:15):**  direct contact with the abattoir and the butchers. John, we're coming to the end of the programme.  
**[0:43:20-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:20):**  Clearly you're despondent following the closure of your abattoir. But just finally, can you  
**[0:43:26-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:26):**  see a future where small abattoirs once again become recognised as the essential resources  
**[0:43:31-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:31):**  that they are? We can see a future in it, but we need to  
**[0:43:34-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:34):**  actually grasp the nettle and actually look at the regulation and create the environment  
**[0:43:39-0:43:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:39):**  in which those small abattoirs can survive. We've had great lists there of all the advantages  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:44):**  to the environment, to local supply chains, you know, that having a small abattoir brings.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:50):**  But we've got to actually grasp that nettle, get some primary regulation in there to deliver  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:43:55):**  a risk-based and proportionate system. We're not asking for handouts. We're asking for  
**[0:44:00-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:00):**  a risk-based fair system, which even the actual regulator actually says we've not got. So  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:05):**  if the regulator's saying we haven't got it, we're all saying we haven't got it, why isn't  
**[0:44:10-0:44:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:10):**  the government actually getting on and doing something about it? Because we stand to lose  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:14):**  too much. You know, obviously upsetting for my business, having done this for 100 years,  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:20):**  you know, and seeing a family, elderly family, extremely upset because they always, they  
**[0:44:26-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:26):**  value so much as I do, this farmer direct farmer link that we can provide all that information  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:32):**  that the customer wants. We know the farms, we know the farmer, we know how he looks after  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:37):**  them. We know how far he brings them. We know the kind of cattle or the kind of pigs he's  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:42):**  producing. We know what time of the year they're going to be at the best. We know how to hang  
**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:46):**  the meat. Is this really something that we want to lose? I mean, we've seen with the  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:50):**  poor pig farmers, you know what I mean? What's happened to them? You know what I mean when  
**[0:44:54-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:54):**  they've actually put all their eggs in the basket supplying the supermarkets, yeah? We've  
**[0:44:59-0:45:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:44:59):**  seen what's happened to them, you know, heartbreaking for those farmers. You know, we don't want  
**[0:45:03-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:03):**  that situation for any animals or farmers. We've really got to get the government to  
**[0:45:08-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:08):**  actually get this primary legislation in and help us produce a system that's fair so that  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:14):**  the Abattoir network can consist of a range of businesses, large and small. I think the  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:19):**  small livestock farmers need to actually get in touch with Defra and get in touch with  
**[0:45:24-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:24):**  the ministers and say to them, look, we're businesses that are dependent on these small  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:29):**  Abattoirs. In themselves, it might be only very small businesses, but the number of businesses  
**[0:45:34-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:34):**  that they actually serve and like with those with 200, how much are they contributing to  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:39):**  the local economy? How many jobs are they providing? How many restaurants and shops  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:45):**  and cafes and that, are they supplying with local meat that's actually got a very low  
**[0:45:50-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:50):**  environmental impact? You look at the small Abattoir sector and say it's only small. Nobody  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:55):**  seems to look at the number of farmers that are actually, you know, using those. And obviously  
**[0:45:59-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:45:59):**  with the changes in the agriculture bill, it looks very much that farmers are even more  
**[0:46:04-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:04):**  dependent, you know what I mean, on that sector. The NFU talks about farmers having choice.  
**[0:46:09-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:09):**  Well, farmers won't have a choice if there's no small Abattoirs because the big guys are  
**[0:46:14-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:14):**  based on throughput. They're not based on adding value for farmers. They're not going  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:18):**  to be able to identify one animal, get all its offal and everything with it, you know,  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:23):**  from whatever method of production, whether it's organic, you know, whether it's a rare  
**[0:46:26-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:26):**  breed or whatever, you know, and then butcher it to a spec that's required by that farmer.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:32):**  The model just doesn't fit that at all. So what you're saying is it's a small industry,  
**[0:46:37-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:37):**  but it's about more than just money. It's the jobs, it's the environmental and social  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:41):**  impact. It's the provision of value added products for other businesses and retails.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:47):**  It's about delivering food and infrastructural security. And we haven't even talked about  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:52):**  the processing of secondary products, you know, like leather skins and that sort of  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Small-abattoirs-e1oje6k#t=0:46:57):**  thing as well. I'd like to thank my guests, Hannah Farragood, Simon Doherty and John Metrick.

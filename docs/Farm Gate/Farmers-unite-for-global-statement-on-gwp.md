### Farm Gate  (Fri, 06 Mar 2020 12:31:21)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. Farmers from across the world have issued  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:11):**  a joint statement calling for governments to recognise the importance of the metric  
**[0:00:15-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:15):**  GWP star. Signatories to the statement include the NFU, CLA, the National Sheep Association  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:23):**  and Beef and Lamb New Zealand. While recognising that climate change is one of the most urgent  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:28):**  challenges we face, farmers' leaders are calling for the role of agricultural methane  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:34):**  to be accurately recognised in policy and accurately accounted for in the footprinting  
**[0:00:39-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:39):**  of agricultural emissions. In a moment I'll speak to Andrew Morrison, the Chairman of  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:43):**  Beef and Lamb New Zealand, and to Phil Stocker, the Chief Executive of the UK's National  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:49):**  Sheep Association.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:51):**  Methane is a short-lived gas, and its warming potential should be considered differently  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:00:55):**  from carbon dioxide, a long-lived gas. The new metric, GWP star, allows us to accurately  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:01):**  measure the impact of ruminant methane for the first time because it focuses on the warming  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:06):**  rather than simply the rate of the emissions themselves. While carbon dioxide and nitrous  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:11):**  oxide are active in the atmosphere for many generations, methane is broken down in about  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:16):**  a decade. This means that the methane emissions from a herd of 100 cows today are simply replacing  
**[0:01:22-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:22):**  the emissions that were first produced when that herd was established by a previous generation  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:26):**  of farmers. There was an initial pulse of warming when that herd was first established,  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:31):**  but there is no ongoing warming from that herd.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:34):**  If you want a full explanation of the role of agricultural methane and the science behind  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:39):**  the new metric, then we have a whole podcast on the subject featuring the Oxford Martin  
**[0:01:44-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:44):**  scientists that developed GWP star. So you can just go to FAIFARMS.COM forward slash podcasts and scroll down.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:53):**  Back to the joint statement. Beef and lamb New Zealand have signed and Andrew Morrison  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:01:58):**  is their chairman. I asked him why GWP star is so important.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:03):**  It's important to all ruminant producers because you know the global debate on climate  
**[0:02:08-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:08):**  change it's at a period we get the science right. Now what science is, you know, the  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:13):**  team at Oxford Martin led by Professor Miles Allen has done a great job in identifying  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:18):**  the different warming potentials of the gases. Now that becomes important because the metrics  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:24):**  in relation to what we have to achieve if we start the debate with the right metrics  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:28):**  it delivers the right result.  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:29):**  And you say in the joint statement that continuing with GWP 100 could lead to bad policy decisions.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:36):**  And I wonder if you could give us an example of just what you mean by that.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:39):**  Well I think the explanation is, you know, the simple terminology of net carbon bills  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:45):**  or zero carbons or whatever, it's the warming potential or the impact on the environment  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:50):**  we're concerned about. It's the relevance of its warming potential and what you have  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:54):**  to do to reduce that. The other reason why this is really important, this GWP star, is  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:02:59):**  the fact that it also identifies that if you're actually increasing your methane it's a highly  
**[0:03:04-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:04):**  effective guess in driving the warming potential up. So like there's a corresponding recognition  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:10):**  of its decrease we also have to acknowledge the corresponding risk if we are increasing  
**[0:03:15-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:15):**  the methane figures.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:16):**  And so if we're thinking in terms of policy then a continued focus on the emission rate  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:22):**  of methane rather than recognising the warming potential of that continued emission. What  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:28):**  do you think that leads to and why is it so important to change the metric to GWP star?  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:33):**  Well simplistically some of the gases have to go to effectively either net or gross zero  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:38):**  depending on how you construct your bill. If you take methane to a zero position you  
**[0:03:45-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:45):**  are delivering significantly more than effectively going status quo, you're going global cooling.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:52):**  And so you would have to recognise that in the policy construction otherwise you're asking  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:03:56):**  methane and ruminant producers to do significantly more than the other gases. And no issues with  
**[0:04:01-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:01):**  that as long as that is recognised.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:04):**  And so from that perspective agriculture would be the only industry on the planet that is  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:10):**  being asked not only to deliver net zero but to go further and deliver cooling within that  
**[0:04:16-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:16):**  same time frame.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:17):**  If you got your metrics using GWP 100 versus the GWP stars I would say the answer is yes.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:23):**  And so we just have to be mindful of that and as I say we all have to look at our options  
**[0:04:27-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:27):**  and comfortable to do things as long as the steps we're taking lead to the targets that  
**[0:04:34-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:34):**  we're setting.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:35):**  So really it's about honesty, it's about having metrics embedded that recognise the most up  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:40):**  to date science and make sure that farmers the same as the rest of the population, other  
**[0:04:45-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:45):**  industries, other citizens around the world are just being treated fairly. Now it's interesting  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:51):**  in the UK the UK government now accepts the science largely because of the work that FAI  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:04:57):**  and Farmwell have done working with government departments to help them understand that issue  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:02):**  but they're still not yet prepared to embed and use the GWP star metric. I wonder how  
**[0:05:07-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:07):**  the New Zealand government's approaching this issue.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:10):**  So we've just hit a zero carbon bill or a zero carbon act down here and they've recognised  
**[0:05:14-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:14):**  the contribution of split gases and recognised that those gases will be treated differently.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:21):**  Now we're still having discussion on what the appropriate percentage reduction is that  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:27):**  delivers no additional warming or keeps the climate change under the two degrees. So that's  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:33):**  where it becomes quite crucial. So it is recognised by the UK Climate Change Commission and we  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:38):**  have recognised that the split gas debate down here, what we have to do is get this  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:42):**  recognised at the international level and the IPCC and have it accepted globally. What  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:47):**  we've got, we've got a very mature government over here who has recognised that to get the  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:53):**  outcomes we need that they will work with farmers and in the next five years we will  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:05:58):**  partner with government to come up with accurate on farm measuring systems so that we can take,  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:05):**  you know if you refer to this as assets and liabilities, we have the liabilities which  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:09):**  are the gases being carbon, nitrous oxide and CH4 methane. The assets that we've got  
**[0:06:15-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:15):**  to look at is ways that we can either sequester in soil, sequester with trees etc or use some  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:22):**  of the technologies we're looking at, genetics, vaccines, inhibitors, all those sorts of things  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:27):**  that we would build a system that recognises the assets in this debate as well as just  
**[0:06:33-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:33):**  not only recognising the liabilities.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:34):**  So it sounds like the New Zealand government is slightly ahead of the UK government in  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:39):**  so far as it's not only recognising the metric exists, it's recognising the difference that  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:44):**  this potentially makes for farmers on the ground and there's a dynamic partnership that's  
**[0:06:49-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:49):**  now grown up so that over the next five years the best ways of accounting for that additional  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:55):**  sequestration that you were mentioning there, that those systems can be developed.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:06:59):**  Yeah well we're doing ourselves disservice in this debate if we don't use science to  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:05):**  inform it and science is informed as to the risks of climate change. But science also  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:10):**  informs us as I say the global warming potential of the different gases, let's use it accurately.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:15):**  And when you talk about dynamic partnerships, you know I'm really pleased, this is a non-border  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:20):**  specific issue, climate change and recognition of the appropriate metrics. So I'm really  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:27):**  proud to have signed off this with these UK farming groups. This is really good stuff  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:33):**  and this is exhibiting global leadership in this space. So yeah we're lucky in New Zealand  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:37):**  dynamic partnerships with government, but dynamic partnerships with UK farming leaders  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:41):**  too is excellent. I really want to commend all these groups who have signed up to this  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:46):**  to understand the relevance and importance of as I say a non-border issue.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:50):**  And you mentioned the global statement that's been made by multiple partners from around  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:07:55):**  the world. What is it particularly that you hope that the global statement will achieve  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:00):**  beyond simply saying that you know we as a global network of farmers believe that this  
**[0:08:06-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:06):**  is the metric that should be used?  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:08):**  Yeah we'll sort of put it in farming terms. A lot of times the general public or different  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:12):**  sectors think oh well if these guys are just trying to play the get out of jail free card.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:17):**  And the other thing that they say well of course you would say that you want to protect  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:20):**  your sector or your industry. But you know it goes beyond that when we see that a lot  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:25):**  of the agri sector community globally are all challenged with the same issues and so  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:30):**  when you know we're looking for the science that will inform the answer. And so that's  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:35):**  where you know we're very proud as I say to partner with all these groups and ask this  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:40):**  global leadership question that we can actually this not only informs the metrics this then  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:46):**  helps inform the solutions as well.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:48):**  Andrew Morrison from Beef and Lamb New Zealand. What's exciting about the joint statement  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:53):**  is that it not only highlights the issue of methane and the change in our understanding  
**[0:08:57-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:08:57):**  of the way that it functions, it also recognises the fact that land can produce multiple public  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:02):**  goods. If livestock is farmed extensively on grass and farmed well, then not only can  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:08):**  we produce high quality food, but we can also deliver carbon sequestration, good water management  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:14):**  and the restoration of nature. Phil Stocker is the chief executive of the UK's National  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:19):**  Sheep Association. I spoke to him about the importance of land use in delivering those  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:24):**  combined public goods.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:26):**  If you think about it over this last 50 years, 60, 70 years, we've had policy drivers that  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:32):**  have almost been single in terms of their output or their interests. From food production,  
**[0:09:39-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:39):**  a need to feed the population and to make food available to people as readily and as  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:45):**  affordably as possible. And then our policies swung almost entirely towards environmental  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:51):**  policies. And we're at a point now where I think there is a really widespread recognition  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:09:55):**  of the need for multiple outcomes from our land management. And we are talking about  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:00):**  producing food at the same time as producing a great landscape, good habitats for nature  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:06):**  and biodiversity, good levels of natural capital, air, soil and water. So we're having to deliver  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:13):**  all of these things and people are starting to think now of broader sustainability assessments  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:18):**  that take into account all of those things collectively. And as an example, it's something  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:22):**  you mentioned there about the fact that if we look too much at methane alone, if you're  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:28):**  not careful, you'll end up with negative unintended consequences. If we want to push all of our  
**[0:10:35-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:35):**  land production to the optimum level of methane output, methane reduction, we would end up  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:45):**  with all of our lands being slaughtered within something like a 12 or 16 week period. And  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:51):**  we would end up with a glut on the market and we would end up with an absence of animals  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:55):**  to be able to graze our land throughout the rest of the year as well. So we've got to  
**[0:10:59-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:10:59):**  start looking at these things through a lens of multiple outputs and outcomes and it has  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:07):**  to be measured in that way. So it's not all about carbon and climate change. It is about  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:11):**  nature and biodiversity. It is about food production. It is about health and wellbeing  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:15):**  of people. Carbon footprinting and methane is one really crucially important aspect of  
**[0:11:20-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:20):**  that, but it's not the be all and end all of everything.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:23):**  No, it strikes me, I mean, the conversations I've had with farmers over the last couple  
**[0:11:26-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:26):**  of years since this science first emerged, farmers always knew that there was an anomaly,  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:33):**  that methane behaved in a different way. So what this science has done is to kind of,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:37):**  is to firm up and stick some foundations underneath what people already thought. And when we're  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:43):**  talking, we're talking about the way in which we can deliver improved climate change impacts  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:47):**  and biodiversity restoration, better soil health, better economic diversity by maintaining  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:54):**  sheep and cattle in the countryside. It seems like a no brainer that government should adopt  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:11:59):**  this. So why do you think that it is, that government hasn't just taken this on? It's  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:03):**  accurate science, it's accepted by government and by the IPCC. Why hasn't it yet been integrated?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:10):**  Yeah, that's a really good question. I think climate science is still relatively new, I  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:16):**  guess. So there's still an absence of understanding of how the whole thing works. And we're also  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:21):**  working increasingly on a global scale. So to have so many nations across the world,  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:27):**  and I agree with you entirely that the whole rationale behind GWP Star is something that  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:32):**  no one can really argue against. And the science is there now to show that we should be moving  
**[0:12:37-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:37):**  away from the previous model. But these things do take time and people are very, very nervous  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:44):**  about making changes to things that are established. And I would also say that we have to be very,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:49):**  very careful about the fact that there will be people that are part of this agenda, this  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:53):**  whole agenda that have got a bigger or wider aims and objectives. And I hate to say this,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:12:59):**  but there has been an anti livestock farming movement that has been part of this. So there  
**[0:13:04-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:04):**  will be some people that want to hold on to, in a way, ways of measuring livestock production,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:12):**  to paint livestock production in a bad light.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:15):**  So what's really important is that government takes a science based approach that they are  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:20):**  rigorous about that science based approach. And now that the science has moved on, government  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:25):**  policy needs to move on to  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:27):**  I think again, that that is absolutely right. And I would also say that it doesn't end here  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:32):**  because whilst GWP Star has looked at and recognise the different behaviour of methane  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:38):**  in the atmosphere, you know, we're still a long way away from really been able to understand  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:43):**  and measure levels of carbon sequestration in our in our grassland and our grassland  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:48):**  soils. So even if we resolve this issue of accepting the different way that methane is  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:53):**  behaving, we've still got further to go in terms of really, really understanding that  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:13:58):**  carbon cycle and understanding the important role that grassland plays in that carbon recycling.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:04):**  Now obviously, this this coalition has come together to promote GWP Star and to call on  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:09):**  government to to do something. And I wonder what it is you want government to do? Are  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:14):**  we expecting climate laws to be rewritten? I mean, I noticed that the Committee on Climate  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:20):**  Change has already recognised GWP Star in its latest land use report, which which had  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:27):**  a very different approach as a result from the report they put out only a year ago. So  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:33):**  are you looking for big legal changes or for some kind of discounting mechanism just around  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:38):**  biological methane?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:40):**  I think we're looking at there could be some elements where there needs to be some legal  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:44):**  changes but I would see this more in terms of a recognition at policy level, it would  
**[0:14:51-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:51):**  influence and affect policy drivers in the future, it would have an impact on our agri-environment  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:14:57):**  schemes and maybe lead to incentives for an encouragement for farming in certain ways.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:03):**  And it would lead to disincentives for types of industries that had a really heavy carbon  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:11):**  footprint. And, you know, just remember that agriculture and livestock production has for  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:16):**  a long time been criticised as having a heavy carbon footprint. And GWP Star suggests that  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:22):**  the majority of beef and lamb production that goes on in the UK is nowhere near as bad as  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:28):**  the picture has been painted in the past. So that in itself could have a clear, could  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:32):**  signify a clear change in the direction of agricultural policy. If you look at our British  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:39):**  sheep industry, it's almost a semi-natural system. In essence, lamb production in the  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:46):**  UK is done primarily from grass and forage crops. And in the majority of the case, in  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:53):**  the majority of cases, the grass and those forage crops are being grown by not very much  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:15:57):**  more than solar energy, sunshine through photosynthesis, rain and soil nutrients. And the whole thing  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:05):**  is a circular economy, if you like, a renewable technology whose reliance on fossil fuels  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:12):**  is very, very low. And I think, you know, we've felt, agree for a long, long time that  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:18):**  the metrics that have been used to measure our industry have painted us in a very bad  
**[0:16:24-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:24):**  and disadvantageous light. And now with this GWP Star, we're starting to get a very early  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:30):**  recognition that producing food from beef and lamb production from grass, the way we  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:36):**  do in the majority of cases here in the UK, is not just a good and efficient way of producing  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:42):**  a high quality food, but it's actually got a positive contribution that it can make to  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:47):**  climate change, our environment, our biodiversity, our natural landscape, habitats, you know,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farmers-unite-for-global-statement-on-GWP-eba6km#t=0:16:52):**  all those things, you know, this is producing a good quality food product while also producing

**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Lobe-Kustain. One of the big stories since the start of  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:11):**  the coronavirus pandemic has been panic buying. People rushing out to food stores to stock  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:16):**  up on essential items. Retailers were slow to intervene, but they've now placed tight  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:21):**  restrictions on the number of items individuals can buy. But why did it take them so long  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:25):**  to act? And is it still too little, too late? At the same time, isn't panic buying an entirely  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:31):**  reasonable response to a coming crisis? People have been watching this modern day plague  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:36):**  unfolding in the media since January. And the dramatic lockdowns now in place were trailed  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:40):**  by the government weeks before they were finally enacted. We've been told repeatedly that  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:45):**  if we have a new persistent cough or a high temperature, then we have to isolate ourselves  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:50):**  in our home for up to 14 days, which frankly is at least twice as long as people would  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:54):**  normally leave between their food shops. So surely stocking up with pasta, spuds and frozen  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:59):**  goods is an entirely sensible response to our anticipated house arrest. Well, while  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:04):**  many supermarket shelves are emptying, farm shops and independent food networks are suddenly  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:10):**  finding themselves much more heavily in demand. Well, surely this is good news. But how can  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:15):**  we maintain this commitment to local food suppliers in the future when we're looking  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:19):**  at COVID-19 in the rear view mirror? In this programme, we'll be looking at the psychology  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:25):**  of panic buying and asking the question, is our food system really resilient enough to  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:31):**  cope? I'm joined by Jo White from Human Behaviour Change for Animals and by Roland  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:36):**  Bonney, a co-founder of FAI Farms. Hi, Jo. Good to have you back. Surely panic buying  
**[0:01:42-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:42):**  is an entirely rational response.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:44):**  Yes and no. There are several factors that relate to panic buying. So as you've outlined,  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:52):**  the fact that people want to prepare in the face of an emergency seems completely rational  
**[0:01:58-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:58):**  because we need to make sure that we have what we need to deal with the situation. But  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:02):**  there are many factors in relation to how people may feel, their emotions. So with heightened  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:08):**  levels of fear and anxiety surrounding this unknown and unseen issue and emergency, people  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:15):**  tend to go into a stage of problem solving and trying to get a sense of control back  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:21):**  into their lives. So from the rational perspective, actually making plans and making sure that  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:27):**  you have the basic needs for day to day life makes a lot of sense. But if we're reacting  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:32):**  emotionally, this may well be that we start to see behaviours such as hoarding and people  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:37):**  over buying and over resourcing themselves, which then has a negative impact on others.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:42):**  But there are many other factors in relation to this, such as the influence of media, reports  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:48):**  we see in the news of empty shelves, social media, where we're getting our information  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:53):**  from in terms of friends, family, colleagues, wider society and how that might be impacting  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:58):**  on how we're feeling and then how we're reacting. So there are a number of factors that we could  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:03):**  look at from a point of view of how much of this behaviour is rational and how much may  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:08):**  be being driven by our emotional state.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:10):**  And I guess it's really difficult for people to know really how to plan. And if we think  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:15):**  of the period in the year when most of us will do a degree of hoarding, which is around  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:21):**  Christmas, that's only three or four days or maybe a week at most when we're hoping  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:26):**  not to go to the supermarket. And even then, these days, the supermarkets are only closed  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:30):**  for a day. We still expect to kind of be able to go out for milk and bread. So people just,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:34):**  they don't really have any experience of how to deal with this situation.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:38):**  Yes. And I think one of the things about us humans is we're not always the best evaluating  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:44):**  what we really need. So from the perspective of thinking about how much pasta you might  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:50):**  need to get you through that 14 day isolation period, it's not necessarily something we're  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:54):**  used to preparing for. So this is where we may switch between that kind of rational thinking  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:00):**  and the emotional thinking. So Dr. Daniel Carmen, who's known as a leading economic  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:06):**  scientist, talked about this from a point of view of how much we may be making emotional  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:12):**  decisions rather than actually evaluating what we need. So from a point of view of thinking  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:19):**  how we prepare for a 14 day isolation period, it's very difficult for us to actually realise  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:25):**  actually how many toilet rolls, for example, are we likely to use in that period of time?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:30):**  So we don't have any experience for it. So this is sort of things that may well be playing  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:34):**  on us when we're actually preparing for what's ahead.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:38):**  And at the same time, the way that the media is covering this, I mean, it's behaving exactly  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:43):**  as you'd expect it to behave, it's getting excited. You know, it's ramping up the peril  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:48):**  element because that's what the media does. And at that point, again, there's that sort  
**[0:04:52-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:52):**  of slightly sort of headless chicken approach that we have where any instinct towards that  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:59):**  sort of more rational approach of trying to sort of say, well, how many grams of pasta  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:02):**  do I need? How many grams of rice, et cetera, et cetera, suddenly kind of go out the window  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:06):**  because everyone's kind of rushing. And then when we hear that the shelves are empty, we  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:11):**  see pictures of that. Again, our instinctive approach is not to plan, but to get in the  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:18):**  car, get to the supermarket and get what we can when we can.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:22):**  Yes, we are herd animals in terms of many of our instincts. So if we see our friends,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:28):**  family here about colleagues, people in our community getting in the car and driving to  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:33):**  the supermarket and buying and stocking up, that's the reaction that we have. We are known  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:39):**  to be loss adverse. So if we think that we might miss out on something, we're more likely  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:44):**  to try and try and stock up and hoard. So if we're sort of going in and seeing the supermarket  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:50):**  shelves emptying, it's playing on that sense of loss and actually triggering those emotions  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:56):**  that we need to take action. We need to make sure that we aren't the person who's going  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:00):**  to lose out.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:01):**  And it seems to me that there's a new factor that's come in just in the last couple of  
**[0:06:04-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:04):**  weeks as well with this, you know, much hyped lockdown situation. When we get off the podcast  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:10):**  today, I'm going shopping. It's the first time I've been shopping for a little while  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:14):**  because we've been able to get deliveries, which we now can't get. My wife was just trying  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:19):**  to order something from Boots yesterday. She was in a queue for five hours and then got  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:23):**  down to 10 minutes before she was at the front of the queue. And it said there are 11,000  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:29):**  people ahead of you in the queue. And that's just in that last 10 minute period. And so  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:33):**  again, that ramps it up. But at the same time, now we've got the police on the road with  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:37):**  road checks. And a lot of people, certainly myself, you know, I feel very nervous of authority.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:43):**  I don't want to be stopped by the police. And so again, I'm not going to make that journey  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:47):**  out to the supermarket any more than I have to. So having now got in the car to go to  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:52):**  the supermarket because of this additional fear of being stopped by the police, I'm likely  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:57):**  to buy perhaps more than I would have done in the past. And I wonder if there is a different  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:02):**  approach, if there's something that if there are different ways that the government or  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:07):**  the media should be behaving in order to try and support this, this more normalised approach  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:12):**  to food shopping.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:13):**  Yes, it's much about providing reassurance and building trust. And I think because of  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:20):**  the fact that there's needing to be quick reactions, as a result, some of the the activities  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:25):**  or the actions that have been taken can be perceived quite negatively. And at a time  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:30):**  when people are feeling anxious and fearful, reassurance is what's needed. And it's being  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:36):**  able to demonstrate that there is enough food to go around and actually reassuring people  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:41):**  that those the police that are out are there to support rather than negatively take action  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:47):**  against people. And I think there's a combination of actually making sure that that's been clearly  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:52):**  and positively communicated. So communication is really important, whether that's communication  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:57):**  from policymakers, the police themselves, but also the supermarket chains just get across  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:03):**  to people so to relieve some of that anxiety, because we've seen many pictures of empty  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:09):**  shelves, but it's also getting out and communicating that there are resources that are accessible,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:16):**  there is toilet roll that people can can access. And it's that message maybe isn't getting  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:21):**  across enough to people to reduce their anxiety.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:25):**  Well let's test that out. Roland, you're a food system expert. Is there genuinely enough  
**[0:08:31-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:31):**  food there?  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:32):**  I think the the short answer to that is yes. Obviously, if the shelves empty in that immediate  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:37):**  circumstance, it's no. But behind that, the answer is yes, we haven't got it. We haven't  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:41):**  had failed harvests. We haven't had typhoons sinking ships for the food. The food's there.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:48):**  It's still being harvested. It's still getting it even from countries that have been heavily  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:52):**  hit by coronavirus like Italy. The lorries are still rolling. So yeah, the answer is  
**[0:08:58-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:58):**  the food's there. I think we're talking about panic buying here. And I would question whether  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:04):**  how much have we seen in terms of empty shelf space is to do with panic buying. I think  
**[0:09:08-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:08):**  the media loves these simple, short headlines that feel a sense of anxiety and create a  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:16):**  sense of urgency to dive back in and read the next account of the unfolding situation  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:23):**  on their particular platform. I think the media are going to be found to have been part  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:28):**  of the problem when we look back at this. And they're going to have to have a review  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:33):**  of how they behave in situations like this. But that'll be for the whole of society to  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:39):**  decide on once this is over. I think this is a rapidly emerging situation. Most people  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:44):**  saw, were hoping at least at the beginning of March for this month that it was really  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:49):**  still a problem from but and on the other side of the world that it would be easily  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:54):**  contained. There was sort of hope while our government and medical experts were getting  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:00):**  to grips with working out the best response or the correct response, we were all having  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:06):**  you know, crossing our fingers that they would find a way of shutting it down. That isn't  
**[0:10:11-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:11):**  the case. That's not been the reality. So I think it's unrealistic to think that we  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:17):**  wouldn't have some bumps and bangs in the situation that's emerging as rapidly as this.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:23):**  And I think to answer the question on food, approximately, I think I might be saying 40%  
**[0:10:28-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:28):**  of meals in the UK are eaten outside of the home. And in the current situation that the  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:35):**  ability to source those meals has been switched off as we've been shut out of pubs as we've  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:40):**  been encouraged in the early phase to distance socially, and we're now for enforce in that  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:45):**  social distancing. So this the food chain's got a huge reset to do in terms of getting  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:52):**  those raw material food products, those basic food products moving from the food service  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:57):**  through the restaurant chain and into the retail chain. So I think I think the retailers  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:02):**  response so far has been substantive, they're hiring more people that food will find its  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:08):**  way into people's homes. But you know, to suddenly think that that can be flipped, that  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:12):**  switch can be flipped overnight, I think, you know, was is again, it's a media field  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:17):**  fantasy. And therefore, the shortages we see, I think, are for the time being a short term,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:23):**  because the food is out there. I think the question which none of us can answer is it  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:27):**  depends how much impact this has on the working population as we go through the harvest, the  
**[0:11:34-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:34):**  vegetable and fruit harvest throughout the rest of the year.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:36):**  Precisely that that's, that's, you know, that that is the really important point, isn't  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:40):**  it? Because I think, you know, you're right, the retailers have responded, you're right,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:43):**  of course, that people are now not eating out. So they're eating more homes are perhaps  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:47):**  some of that element of there being less food on the shelves is because people are just  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:51):**  catering more at home. But at the same time, you know, we've both poked our fingers at  
**[0:11:57-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:57):**  the media and said, you know, they're ramping up the jeopardy and that doesn't help. But  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:01):**  at the same time, we're, we're seeing, you know, news releases, news articles coming  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:05):**  out inspired by the NFU, etc, saying we're not going to be able to bring in the harvest,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:09):**  therefore, there is going to be this food crisis in the future.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:12):**  Yeah, I think I think then if you're right to raise the fact that we, we have got a problem  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:17):**  in terms of identifying where that labour force is currently going to come from, I think  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:22):**  in the same ways that we've been able to increase the capacity of feet and hands in the National  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:28):**  Health Service, you know, it's not beyond the wit of hand to think that society won't  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:32):**  step up and you know, ensure we get the harvest in not just here, but across Europe. So I  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:37):**  think the NFU are absolutely right to flag this early doors in this crisis, but I'm hopeful  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:42):**  that we'll find sources of labour and be in a position to respond to that. And I think,  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:47):**  you know, government can play its part in, you know, encouraging people to, you know,  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:52):**  help in that sector as things unfold. But I, again, I think it's, I, you know, I am  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:57):**  weary of frightening consumers and frightening the population. I think we, you know, we need  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:01):**  to be calm about this now. We're all having our lives impacted, and we're all going to  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:06):**  have to do different things going forward. And some of that may be contributing to picking  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:10):**  vegetables. But again, reality check is we, you know, we only grow something like 30%  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:15):**  of our fruit and vegetables in this country currently. We are also extremely reliant on  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:21):**  our European neighbours to, you know, to maintain that source of supply. So we need to be thinking  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:27):**  of how we work with them intelligently through this period.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:31):**  And at the same time, you know, if we're talking about our neighbours, you know, out to the  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:36):**  rest of Europe, they're going through a similar situation where people again, are shopping  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:41):**  in order to eat more in their own homes. And so are we not likely to see a sort of greater  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:46):**  level of nationalism sort of creeping in around those food supplies. So, you know, France  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:51):**  or Germany or Spain or whoever will be wanting to maintain the food that they have to reduce,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:56):**  reduce exports to places like Britain. And so, you know, there's the potential for, you  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:01):**  know, if we're only producing 30% of the fruit and veg that we have here, then we might find  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:07):**  it quite difficult going forwards to source from other countries if they are starting  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:11):**  to be more restrictive about those exports. And then just as another question to load  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:15):**  in there for you to respond to, is that issue around processes and packers. And if we start  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:22):**  to see significant numbers of workers in a process, in a meat processing plant, for example,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:28):**  going off with Coronavirus, whether there are the people to step in, especially the  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:32):**  slightly more skilled jobs, you know, it's different, perhaps, you know, spending a morning  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:37):**  learning how to pick potatoes, to learning how to use some of the more complicated machines  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:42):**  that need to be used in processing plants.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:44):**  Well, I think to deal with the first part of that question, there seems to have been  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:48):**  generally less panic buying on the continent than we've had here, or what's been characterised  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:54):**  as panic buying, I think they're suffering from the same challenges of shifting. And  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:59):**  actually, I don't think you should underplay, it's not a question of people are eating a  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:03):**  bit less out and a lot more in the reality is we're all eating everything in there where  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:07):**  we're locked down and as increasing parts of Europe are locked down 100% of food is  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:11):**  being consumed in the home. That's a huge logistical change for those supply chains.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:17):**  It's been interesting in the UK, you know, people are short of milk in the retail, but  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:21):**  the price for milk, you know, there are dairy farmers now there, they can't shift their  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:25):**  product because they've been supplying restaurants. And it takes a bit of time for that supply  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:30):**  to be resolved. But you know, going back to the original question is that the food is  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:34):**  still there, it's still being produced, we just need to redirect it in the supply chains.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:39):**  To answer your second point in terms of maintaining the flow through the supply chain, I think,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:44):**  you know, one of the things that's become evident for people who don't understand the  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:48):**  food supply chain that at times like this, in fact, at all times, people in the food  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:53):**  supply chain from farmers through the processors through the lorries drivers, the distribution  
**[0:15:58-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:58):**  of logistics companies are key workers that support society on hourly basis, we're buying  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:04):**  food often many of our urban population, they have very little in the house, and they buy  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:10):**  their food on the way home from work for the evening meal. And we've got used to living  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:15):**  that way. And we're able to live that way because of the sophisticated food supply chain  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:20):**  that we have, we have an amazing diet these days, we can source fresh food every day.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:25):**  But at times like that, that is a threat to us because fresh food goes off very quickly.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:31):**  And it's something we've been advocating access to fresh food and vegetables. But the bit  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:36):**  that gets forgotten sometimes is they don't store for very long. And I think that's something  
**[0:16:40-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:40):**  that's going to need to be thought about. At the end of this, when we come out of it  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:43):**  is a is a balance in terms of food people talking about food stocks, well, you can't  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:48):**  store fresh broccoli for very long.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:50):**  I'm interested, Joe, you're sort of taking on what Roland's mentioned there, and how  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:55):**  the retailers could could do better to help because I, you know, I hear what Roland says  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:59):**  that the retailers have responded, they've responded pretty quickly, they've made sure  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:03):**  that there's, you know, food coming in as far as possible, where I would criticize the  
**[0:17:07-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:07):**  retailers is in the way that they have been expecting customers to behave. So for example,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:14):**  I was, you know, I was quite surprised shocked even how slow it took retailers to to enforce  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:20):**  that social distancing that was necessary to make sure that touchscreens were wiped  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:24):**  down. You know, it really wasn't until the lockdown happened officially that they began  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:28):**  doing that certainly in in the area around me. So if people are going in, and we have  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:32):**  these challenges, as Roland said, in in the city, at least, and you know, and I mean,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:37):**  I live in rural Dorset, and I still, you know, do this to an extent you buy on a day to day  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:42):**  basis. And so it's not just that people are starting to have to plan and and think for  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:47):**  a bit longer. It's, you know, it's a really big change. And are there things that retailers  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:51):**  could do, you know, more proactively to help people change their behaviors, I don't know,  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:56):**  with recipes or suggesting store foods that are good making sure that they're promoting  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:01):**  those store foods and getting more of those in place.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:04):**  I think that's really important point because people in as Roland's highlighted, you know,  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:09):**  people in certain situations may well live on a day to day basis in terms of buying their  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:14):**  food. We still live very, very much of a convenience food society where the ready meal is something  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:21):**  or the quick meal is something that we utilize. And for many, because of their lifestyles,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:27):**  actually cooking up something from scratch is quite an alien concept. And actually, that's  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:31):**  not that's because of the pressures of life and work. But we're in a very different situation  
**[0:18:35-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:35):**  at this moment in time. And it does present an opportunity for people to upskill. And  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:41):**  this is where that the retailers could well support people, because it's the situation  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:46):**  of actually how you utilize your feeds, you get the most out of it, we're reducing waste,  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:52):**  and that people can try and maintain a healthy diet, but actually using what's in the shop  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:57):**  at the time, rather than going down the line of what they have habitually purchased in  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:03):**  the price in the past, we're very habitual animals in terms of kind of our shopping and  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:08):**  purchasing behaviors. So it's very easy to just to walk into the shop and go to the same  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:12):**  aisles and pick up the same things. But when you're confronted with not being there, it's  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:17):**  the it's the kind of where do you go next. And this is where the shops and retailers  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:21):**  could well support people from a point of view of giving them suggestions of how to  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:26):**  cook the produce that's in the shops, how to deal with how to process that how to it's  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:33):**  right from the scratch, actually, with some of these, the fruit and vegetables, you know,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:37):**  it's how you cook it and and how you can utilize it. One of the things I've learned since I've  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:43):**  been in lockdown is how you can use kitchen scraps to start growing your own vegetables.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:49):**  And it's something I've never even really looked into before. So actually, avoiding  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:53):**  waste, there's many different areas that the retakes can positively support people in.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:58):**  It's really very interesting, isn't it that there is the way that you know, this is a  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:02):**  this is a crisis that nobody really predicted or certainly that governments never modeled  
**[0:20:07-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:07):**  for. And so there's been very little thought in advance. And this is just it's an unfolding  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:13):**  crisis with government responding, responding, responding. And all the time, it's it's very  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:18):**  difficult when you're simply responding to think outside the box. And, and if we were,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:23):**  you know, three years out, we knew this pandemic was coming, and we were planning for it, then  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:28):**  I imagine that we do things in very different ways. And we were talking before the podcast  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:32):**  started about schools and the way that you know, work is being sent home. And when you  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:36):**  were talking there, Joe, I was just sort of thinking about the way in which perhaps there  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:40):**  is an opportunity here for government to think a bit more laterally. And instead of simply  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:45):**  trying to make sure that kids keep up with especially in primary school level, keep up  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:50):**  with the work that they would have been doing if they were at school thinking, well, how  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:53):**  can we utilize this resource that we have to educate, you know, the the information  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:59):**  that's going home, not just to kids, but to parents, to help them relearn how to cook  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:04):**  how to how to use scraps, to communicate different ways of dealing with food and thinking about  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:09):**  food, growing food at home, and actually bringing some of these different agencies together  
**[0:21:15-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:15):**  to work more productively.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:16):**  I mean, it is a fantastic opportunity from a point of view of being able to reach children  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:22):**  and and also support their parents from a point of view of our while the whole family,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:27):**  in many cases, are all stuck together at home, it provides activities that are helping children  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:33):**  to learn about the world around them about how that they can have skills that will be  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:38):**  useful to them as they grow up in terms of what they're eating, how where it comes from,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:43):**  how they how they can grow it, how they they can have a healthy diet, it can it has many  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:49):**  different levels that it can engage a population. And when we're looking at habits and behaviors  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:55):**  that we want to last into adulthood, primary aged children, that's that's kind of one of  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:00):**  the most important ages to get to, I think was it by seven to nine years old, many of  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:04):**  our habits have formed. So if those children are at home, learning how to cook, learning  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:10):**  what local produce they can use and where they can access it from, that's the amazing  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:15):**  gift to come out of of this very difficult time.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:18):**  So nature has gifted us an opportunity to create a whole new generation of food citizens,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:24):**  if we, you know, if we if we think slightly more creatively. Roland, I want to get into  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:29):**  the negative aspects and then come back to the positive, we're going to talk about some  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:33):**  of the really good stuff to come out of it in a moment. But just before we do that, what  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:38):**  are the factors that you think could lead to a real worsening of the situation, a worsening  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:43):**  of food availability?  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:45):**  I think in the short term, in relation to this situation, maintaining enough key workers  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:51):**  for nations to be cooperating is critical. I see I see that happening in Europe. And  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:58):**  hopefully, I think I think also between ourselves in Europe. And that's important because we're  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:04):**  going to need to we're going to need to do that. I think the key work thing is important  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:08):**  is that people are not used to thanking the person at the Clicking Collectors Sainsbury's  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:12):**  for just being there. I think that's something we can do as consumers is to when we when  
**[0:23:18-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:18):**  with our bin men, you know, the NHS is an obvious one. And obviously they're on the  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:24):**  front line and taking the you know, the real heat of this. But without those guys moving  
**[0:23:30-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:30):**  out, you know, food around, we don't eat. So I think one of the things we need to do  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:33):**  is say thank you look them in the eye and thank them for being there. I think it's difficult  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:37):**  to predict how this is going to roll out. But I think governments are recognising that  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:40):**  you know, anyone involved in the food chain is a key worker. And that's critical that  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:43):**  that recognition is consolidated now and to ensure that there is enough there are enough  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:50):**  people on deck. I'm not too worried. And to be honest, again, I'm not one for peddling  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:54):**  fear in these situations. I don't think it's helpful. I think we need to grit our teeth  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:58):**  and you know, commit to helping each other. And if there is a shortage of workers, we're  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:02):**  going to need to request, you know, a volunteer force, although I think in this case, that  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:05):**  volunteer force will can expect to get paid if they're feeding us. So I think that's the  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:10):**  short term risk in all of this. I think that's the most obvious one is that just enough people  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:15):**  taking the processing factories and on some of those jobs that they're to do them,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:19):**  There are sort of counterintuitive elements within that as well, though, aren't there  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:22):**  in the idea of a volunteer force, you know, when we talk about a force that suggests to  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:28):**  me a large body of people. And at the same time, we're being told to social distance  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:33):**  the whole time that we can't go within two metres of people. So if we're if we're then  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:38):**  talking about if I think of my own responses and my own family, I feel more fearful today  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:44):**  than I did a week ago, probably than I did a week before that, you know, I've got to  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:49):**  the stage now because this is drummed into us and it's become it's and it's really fascinating  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:53):**  how quickly the human brain adapts. But when I'm walking down the street, and and you know,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:00):**  one of my kids reaches out to hold my hand, my first instinct is to sort of slightly pull  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:04):**  away and then I remember that it's my child and it's and it's not somebody else walking  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:08):**  down the street and I don't need to worry about it. But there's there's sort of these  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:10):**  little things that are creeping in. So the idea of of getting loads of people out there,  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:16):**  it sort of kind of flies in the face of what we're being told to do.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:20):**  I think I think, you know, again, I would go back to the to the head of this is that  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:24):**  this is a this has been a rapidly emerging situation. So I think for us to be somewhat  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:30):**  confused by our own behaviours and how we should be reaction is perfectly normal. So  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:35):**  I wouldn't beat yourself up too much over that. The analogy I would use when I was a  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:39):**  young man, I went and worked in Australia and I ended up in a in the south east of South  
**[0:25:43-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:43):**  Australia on one job. And I it's a very big snake area or it certainly was then, you know,  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:49):**  you would see snakes pretty much every day. And you know, some of them could give you  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:53):**  a pretty nasty time of it if you got hit. And the first week I was there, I was I was  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:58):**  a sort of nervous wreck. Let's put it that way between the spiders and the snakes. I  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:03):**  thought, God, how does anyone live in this environment? And what the most amazing thing  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:07):**  was watching my own behaviour from 10 days into that. Looking back at how relaxed I was,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:13):**  I'd learned to kick things. I'd worked out how to live in that environment very quickly.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:18):**  And I think we're going through that now. I think social distancing is something none  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:22):**  of us are skilled at because we haven't needed to have that skill. We now need to acquire  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:26):**  it. We need to work out how to conduct it. My wife and I went for a dog walk yesterday  
**[0:26:30-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:30):**  and I think we probably passed 10 to a dozen couples or runners, etc. 100% of those people  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:39):**  ensured that they were at two metres spacing from us. There wasn't a single failure. It  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:44):**  was impressive how quickly people have adapted. So, you know, I think, you know, give it another  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:49):**  two or three weeks, we'll all get used to working out how to do that. We went to Sainsbury's  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:53):**  this morning to pick up shopping and the guys there are operating a social distancing system  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:59):**  very effectively. It's impressive how quickly we are able to adapt. But, you know, quick  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:04):**  though it is, it still takes a few days and it takes a while to work it out for ourselves.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:08):**  So it will normalise, I guess, as we go forwards. And I suppose, Jo, kind of coming back to  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:13):**  you, that sort of human behaviour element, the more the government locks down, perhaps  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:18):**  the amount that we're allowed to go outside, the keener we will be to take an opportunity  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:23):**  to get out and spend some additional time in the fields picking leaks.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:27):**  Yeah, again, that's another opportunity, isn't it? From the point of view of being able to  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:31):**  help. And I think there's a lot of evidence around volunteering and how good it is for  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:37):**  your mental health and your mental wellbeing. That coupled with the evidence around getting  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:42):**  out in nature and physical exercise for all physical and mental wellbeing. I think the  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:48):**  opportunities to support and help with food production does offer an opportunity there  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:55):**  that could be utilized. I think one of the challenges is how there's a lot of talk about  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:01):**  those working in small businesses and small enterprises, self-employed, those working  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:08):**  in the gig economy and what will happen with them. And it's potential, there is a potential  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:12):**  opportunity there, but it's how you can connect those workers who may not be living in rural  
**[0:28:18-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:18):**  areas to those who are in need from a point of view of farms and the need to keep our  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:26):**  food systems working. So I think there are opportunities, but there's a bit of a challenge  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:30):**  there about kind of how you're going to link those systems together.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:33):**  That's a really interesting point. And I wonder, Roland, you know, from your experience within,  
**[0:28:37-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:37):**  you know, these sort of larger companies, is that a role, is there a role there for  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:40):**  government or is there a role there for business? Whose responsibility is it to connect up those  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:46):**  people who are freelancers or people who've been furloughed working in the gig economy  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:52):**  to recruit them and get them out there into the fields if and as and when that's necessary?  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:56):**  Well, I think the answer is both. And I think particularly when we're under an enforced  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:01):**  lockdown government's got to play a very significant role in working out how that's done because  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:07):**  we're, you know, we're under some fairly draconian rules right now. So, but, you know, hotels  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:11):**  are empty in these rural areas. What I'm trying to say is that there are assets that can be  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:18):**  utilised to facilitate, you know, a local labour force in these areas. You know, it  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:25):**  can be done. It's just a question of working out how best to do it, how to do it fairly  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:29):**  because, you know, we can't forcibly put people at increased risk. I don't see there's any  
**[0:29:33-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:33):**  reason for that in the food chain. I think it's quite possible to, you know, keep risk  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:37):**  at a very reasonable level. I mean, there is no such thing as zero risk. You know, we've  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:41):**  all got to go out and get food or transfer it into our homes. You know, there's risk  
**[0:29:45-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:45):**  attached to everything in relation to something, you know, something like this virus. I think  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:49):**  one of the things that needs saying about the, we shouldn't judge our food chain, you  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:55):**  know, from singular situations like the coronavirus, because you could say at the moment, if you  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:59):**  say, well, you know, what's the weak link in the current situation? And it's the long  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:03):**  distance transport of food. We're reliant on other nations. We're not in control of  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:08):**  their health system. So you can very quickly paint a picture of where, you know, local  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:12):**  supply in the current situation is important. And I would support that. I think we do need  
**[0:30:16-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:16):**  to decentralise our food system over the coming decades. I do think we need to grow more food  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:22):**  locally for health reasons and for food security reasons. But, and there is a but, is that  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:29):**  we do need to maintain a trading food because the weakest link on the back of a typhoon  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:34):**  or a flood, you know, or a very wet harvest in one part of the world means that if we  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:39):**  have a trading food system, we can source food from elsewhere. If that trading system,  
**[0:30:44-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:44):**  if we were just local, as would have been the case, you know, in medieval, pre-medieval  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:49):**  times, if the harvest failed, people died. And one of the great things about our international  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:55):**  food system is that we can move food commodities around the world to where they're needed.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:00):**  And I think we, you know, we need to recognise it's, there's two ends to this equation. It  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:04):**  depends on the situation as to what the weakest link is on what's perceived to be the strongest  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:09):**  element of any existing food chain. I think there is a need to rebalance. I think there  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:14):**  is a need to decentralise, but I don't think that we should think that, you know, trading  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:18):**  food globally is all bad. It certainly is not.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:22):**  So there's a book that came out recently written by Tim Lang, which has been, you know, much,  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:27):**  much promoted certainly in the pages of The Guardian and around social media, around the  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:32):**  idea that, you know, the food system is broken and coronavirus certainly, I mean, I doubt  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:38):**  it's in the book, but it's certainly in the PR around the book that this shows us that  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:43):**  the food system really needs fundamental change from the inside out, from one side to the  
**[0:31:49-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:49):**  other. And what you're saying is that actually you think that the food system is responding  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:54):**  reasonably well, that there is a certain level of robustness and that yes, change is needed,  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:00):**  but it's a rebalancing and a much more nuanced approach.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:02):**  Yeah, I think it's, I think the food system needs to evolve. I don't think it is, you  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:07):**  know, a hundred percent fit for purpose at all currently. I think we, we need to think  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:12):**  of food, not just as something as fuel, but also as nutrition. I think that that whole  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:17):**  conversation is evolving in terms of our own, you know, our own health and our own burden  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:22):**  on the health system, et cetera. So I think as I say, I'm a, I'm an advocate of a steady  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:28):**  decentralization of food processes, but you know, I think there are dangers that either  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:33):**  extreme of sort of localization and globalization and the happy medium definitely sits somewhere  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:39):**  in between and we need to design that happy medium. I'm also, although I would, I agree  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:44):**  with and sometimes a lot of the conclusions that academics and who have concerns over  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:50):**  the food chain, I object to people saying the food system is broken. I think that's  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:54):**  a ridiculous statement because it's quite evidently not. People get fed every day and  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:58):**  even in this crisis at the moment, that's still the case. Is it a hundred percent fit  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:03):**  for purpose with 7.5 billion plus people on the planet? No, I think we, there are things  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:08):**  we still need to do, but I think three years ago I think it was the first time more people  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:13):**  died of obesity than they did a malnutrition. So it's difficult to say that we've got a  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:19):**  problem with food in terms of production and access to it at a macro level. Of course there  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:24):**  are individual situations where people are struggling to feed themselves even in our,  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:28):**  well that's another term I object to is food poverty. I certainly in countries like the  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:33):**  UK, you know, it's a ludicrous statement. There is no such thing as food poverty. There  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:37):**  is just poverty. And if people have enough money, food is 8% of our average salary. If  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:44):**  people are struggling to buy enough food, it's because they don't have enough money,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:48):**  not because food is too cheap. We've only got a few minutes left and I kind of want  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:52):**  to end on a positive note. We're seeing a big resurgence in localism as a result of  
**[0:33:58-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:58):**  the pandemic where people certainly in more rural areas are noticing that pressure on  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:04):**  the big retailers. They're suddenly finding their local farm shop, their local independent  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:10):**  food network and they're tapping into those. You know, when I went to the local farm shop,  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:15):**  which is only about quarter of a mile away from where I live, I'm very lucky. You know,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:19):**  sometimes the queues are out of the door where ordinarily, you know, they're perhaps waiting  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:24):**  for customers from one 20 minutes to the next. So that's a really positive thing. People  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:29):**  have rediscovered these local networks and these local producers. Do you think that we'll  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:34):**  be able to maintain that interest in those producers after the pandemic has finished  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:40):**  and we're looking at it in that rear view mirror?  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:42):**  I don't know the answer to that, Finlow. I think only time will tell whether it'll be  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:48):**  maintained. I think the interesting question almost, you know, after the pandemic, but  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:53):**  in any case, is the world is moving to an urban, to urban living. More people live in  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:59):**  cities than don't now. So when we talk about sourcing from a local farm shop, I think that's  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:04):**  true of those of us that are lucky enough to live in the countryside or close to it.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:09):**  But the majority of people don't live next to farm shops. I think the challenge is how  
**[0:35:13-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:13):**  do we, how do we redefine local food? I think it's more to do with connecting the producer  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:20):**  and the consumer on an ongoing basis because, you know, consumers need producers. They need  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:26):**  people to commit to growing crops and to producing food. And there's a long lead time before  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:32):**  food gets on the table for a farmer who's taking, putting that crop in the ground or  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:38):**  that, you know, those animals into the system. There can be three year lead time before they  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:43):**  see a return from that decision. And the crazy thing about the food chain is that we all  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:48):**  know we're going to eat. We all know pretty much what sort of things we're going to eat,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:52):**  but we don't commit to it. So we, I think we need to de-risk the food chain by removing  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:57):**  some of that sort of commercial trading element to at least some of the core, our core diet,  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:02):**  wherever we are in the world. I think we should be looking at 60% of our core diet being committed  
**[0:36:08-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:08):**  because we're going to eat it anyway.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:09):**  I suppose we're always going to need pasta. We're always going to need spuds. We know  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:14):**  that we're going to want vegetables even if we're not entirely certain exactly which vegetable  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:19):**  we want. And so, I mean, I think that's a, that's a whole nother podcast, isn't it?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:23):**  I think the other thing to add though, it, yes, we are going to need those, but we're  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:26):**  going to also need products that you can store. It's all very, everyone's talking about fresh  
**[0:36:30-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:30):**  food and vegetables and fruit, et cetera, but we need products we can store to keep  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:35):**  resilience in the food chain. And that's something that needs thinking. If we just go to just,  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:40):**  just in time, fresh food all the time and something goes wrong, our fuel supply falls  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:46):**  away and the crop fails in the case of some of this urbanised production that's coming  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:51):**  through now, or we have, as I say, bad harvests, we need to fall back on foods that can be  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:56):**  stored preferably at ambient, and can be stored for long periods of time.  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:01):**  Joe, just finally, going back to you, that question of trying to make sure that this  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:06):**  resurgent interest in local shops for those people who are within range of them and the  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:12):**  use of local food networks, for example, in Oxford, even though it's an urban centre,  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:17):**  there's, you know, there are good networks of food producers bringing food into people  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:22):**  in the city there. What do you think that producers can do if they're listening to this  
**[0:37:27-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:27):**  podcast to make sure that they keep hold of those customers in the future?  
**[0:37:32-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:32):**  I think if we look at some of the evidence around how supermarkets have utilised our  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:40):**  human behaviour over the years, we can learn some really useful lessons. So people are,  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:45):**  as I think I mentioned earlier, they're very habitual in their behaviours in terms of purchasing,  
**[0:37:51-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:51):**  but the times when those habits get shaken, and if you think about 40 to 45% of our daily  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:57):**  yet behaviours are habitual, habits are very, very hard to break. But the things that change  
**[0:38:02-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:02):**  our habits are when very significant events occur in our lives. So this is why the supermarkets  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:09):**  target us when we move house or people are having children, and the marketing material  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:16):**  comes through to buy certain items that might relate to your change in circumstance. We  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:21):**  can also think about this in the fact that people are changing their behaviours, they're  
**[0:38:26-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:26):**  changing habits that have been very fixed for a long time. They're having to do that  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:30):**  because of the circumstance at the moment. And it's had to be about building on that  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:34):**  and encouraging people from a point of view of what's in it for them, why do they support  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:39):**  their local businesses. And if they build up that relationship, they can see value in  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:46):**  the produce that they can obtain. I think there is every chance that that can be continued  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:51):**  moving forwards because people are not there receptive to doing something different because  
**[0:38:56-0:39:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:56):**  their behaviours have been changed very dramatically because of this.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:00):**  So there's something about learning from the way that the big retailers have promoted themselves,  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:06):**  trying to perhaps to actively capture some of the data of people coming through so that,  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:11):**  you know, in times to come, those producers and farm shops are able to remind the customers  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:17):**  who came to them during the pandemic that they still exist to let them know what they've  
**[0:39:21-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:21):**  got in the shop. Look, we're out of time. And I'm not panicking, but I do need to go  
**[0:39:26-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:26):**  to the shops. So I'm going to I'm going to cut us off there. I'd like to say thank you  
**[0:39:30-0:39:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:30):**  very much to my guests, to Joe White from Human Behaviour Change for Animals, to Roland

**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:58):**  Bye for now.

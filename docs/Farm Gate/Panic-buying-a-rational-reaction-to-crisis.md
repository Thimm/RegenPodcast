**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Lobe-Kustain. One of the big stories since the start of  the coronavirus pandemic has been panic buying. People rushing out to food stores to stock  up on essential items. Retailers were slow to intervene, but they've now placed tight  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:21):**  restrictions on the number of items individuals can buy. But why did it take them so long  to act? And is it still too little, too late? At the same time, isn't panic buying an entirely  reasonable response to a coming crisis? People have been watching this modern day plague  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:36):**  unfolding in the media since January. And the dramatic lockdowns now in place were trailed  by the government weeks before they were finally enacted. We've been told repeatedly that  if we have a new persistent cough or a high temperature, then we have to isolate ourselves  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:00:50):**  in our home for up to 14 days, which frankly is at least twice as long as people would  normally leave between their food shops. So surely stocking up with pasta, spuds and frozen  goods is an entirely sensible response to our anticipated house arrest. Well, while  
**[0:01:04-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:04):**  many supermarket shelves are emptying, farm shops and independent food networks are suddenly  finding themselves much more heavily in demand. Well, surely this is good news. But how can  we maintain this commitment to local food suppliers in the future when we're looking  
**[0:01:19-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:19):**  at COVID-19 in the rear view mirror? In this programme, we'll be looking at the psychology  of panic buying and asking the question, is our food system really resilient enough to  cope? I'm joined by Jo White from Human Behaviour Change for Animals and by Roland  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:36):**  Bonney, a co-founder of FAI Farms. Hi, Jo. Good to have you back. Surely panic buying  is an entirely rational response.  Yes and no. There are several factors that relate to panic buying. So as you've outlined,  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:01:52):**  the fact that people want to prepare in the face of an emergency seems completely rational  because we need to make sure that we have what we need to deal with the situation. But  there are many factors in relation to how people may feel, their emotions. So with heightened  
**[0:02:08-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:08):**  levels of fear and anxiety surrounding this unknown and unseen issue and emergency, people  tend to go into a stage of problem solving and trying to get a sense of control back  into their lives. So from the rational perspective, actually making plans and making sure that  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:27):**  you have the basic needs for day to day life makes a lot of sense. But if we're reacting  emotionally, this may well be that we start to see behaviours such as hoarding and people  over buying and over resourcing themselves, which then has a negative impact on others.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:42):**  But there are many other factors in relation to this, such as the influence of media, reports  we see in the news of empty shelves, social media, where we're getting our information  from in terms of friends, family, colleagues, wider society and how that might be impacting  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:02:58):**  on how we're feeling and then how we're reacting. So there are a number of factors that we could  look at from a point of view of how much of this behaviour is rational and how much may  be being driven by our emotional state.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:10):**  And I guess it's really difficult for people to know really how to plan. And if we think  of the period in the year when most of us will do a degree of hoarding, which is around  Christmas, that's only three or four days or maybe a week at most when we're hoping  
**[0:03:26-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:26):**  not to go to the supermarket. And even then, these days, the supermarkets are only closed  for a day. We still expect to kind of be able to go out for milk and bread. So people just,  they don't really have any experience of how to deal with this situation.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:38):**  Yes. And I think one of the things about us humans is we're not always the best evaluating  what we really need. So from the perspective of thinking about how much pasta you might  need to get you through that 14 day isolation period, it's not necessarily something we're  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:03:54):**  used to preparing for. So this is where we may switch between that kind of rational thinking  and the emotional thinking. So Dr. Daniel Carmen, who's known as a leading economic  scientist, talked about this from a point of view of how much we may be making emotional  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:12):**  decisions rather than actually evaluating what we need. So from a point of view of thinking  how we prepare for a 14 day isolation period, it's very difficult for us to actually realise  actually how many toilet rolls, for example, are we likely to use in that period of time?  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:30):**  So we don't have any experience for it. So this is sort of things that may well be playing  on us when we're actually preparing for what's ahead.  And at the same time, the way that the media is covering this, I mean, it's behaving exactly  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:43):**  as you'd expect it to behave, it's getting excited. You know, it's ramping up the peril  element because that's what the media does. And at that point, again, there's that sort  of slightly sort of headless chicken approach that we have where any instinct towards that  
**[0:04:59-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:04:59):**  sort of more rational approach of trying to sort of say, well, how many grams of pasta  do I need? How many grams of rice, et cetera, et cetera, suddenly kind of go out the window  because everyone's kind of rushing. And then when we hear that the shelves are empty, we  
**[0:05:11-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:11):**  see pictures of that. Again, our instinctive approach is not to plan, but to get in the  car, get to the supermarket and get what we can when we can.  Yes, we are herd animals in terms of many of our instincts. So if we see our friends,  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:28):**  family here about colleagues, people in our community getting in the car and driving to  the supermarket and buying and stocking up, that's the reaction that we have. We are known  to be loss adverse. So if we think that we might miss out on something, we're more likely  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:05:44):**  to try and try and stock up and hoard. So if we're sort of going in and seeing the supermarket  shelves emptying, it's playing on that sense of loss and actually triggering those emotions  that we need to take action. We need to make sure that we aren't the person who's going  
**[0:06:00-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:00):**  to lose out.  And it seems to me that there's a new factor that's come in just in the last couple of  weeks as well with this, you know, much hyped lockdown situation. When we get off the podcast  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:10):**  today, I'm going shopping. It's the first time I've been shopping for a little while  because we've been able to get deliveries, which we now can't get. My wife was just trying  to order something from Boots yesterday. She was in a queue for five hours and then got  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:23):**  down to 10 minutes before she was at the front of the queue. And it said there are 11,000  people ahead of you in the queue. And that's just in that last 10 minute period. And so  again, that ramps it up. But at the same time, now we've got the police on the road with  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:37):**  road checks. And a lot of people, certainly myself, you know, I feel very nervous of authority.  I don't want to be stopped by the police. And so again, I'm not going to make that journey  out to the supermarket any more than I have to. So having now got in the car to go to  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:06:52):**  the supermarket because of this additional fear of being stopped by the police, I'm likely  to buy perhaps more than I would have done in the past. And I wonder if there is a different  approach, if there's something that if there are different ways that the government or  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:07):**  the media should be behaving in order to try and support this, this more normalised approach  to food shopping.  Yes, it's much about providing reassurance and building trust. And I think because of  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:20):**  the fact that there's needing to be quick reactions, as a result, some of the the activities  or the actions that have been taken can be perceived quite negatively. And at a time  when people are feeling anxious and fearful, reassurance is what's needed. And it's being  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:36):**  able to demonstrate that there is enough food to go around and actually reassuring people  that those the police that are out are there to support rather than negatively take action  against people. And I think there's a combination of actually making sure that that's been clearly  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:07:52):**  and positively communicated. So communication is really important, whether that's communication  from policymakers, the police themselves, but also the supermarket chains just get across  to people so to relieve some of that anxiety, because we've seen many pictures of empty  
**[0:08:09-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:09):**  shelves, but it's also getting out and communicating that there are resources that are accessible,  there is toilet roll that people can can access. And it's that message maybe isn't getting  across enough to people to reduce their anxiety.  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:25):**  Well let's test that out. Roland, you're a food system expert. Is there genuinely enough  food there?  I think the the short answer to that is yes. Obviously, if the shelves empty in that immediate  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:37):**  circumstance, it's no. But behind that, the answer is yes, we haven't got it. We haven't  had failed harvests. We haven't had typhoons sinking ships for the food. The food's there.  It's still being harvested. It's still getting it even from countries that have been heavily  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:08:52):**  hit by coronavirus like Italy. The lorries are still rolling. So yeah, the answer is  the food's there. I think we're talking about panic buying here. And I would question whether  how much have we seen in terms of empty shelf space is to do with panic buying. I think  
**[0:09:08-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:08):**  the media loves these simple, short headlines that feel a sense of anxiety and create a  sense of urgency to dive back in and read the next account of the unfolding situation  on their particular platform. I think the media are going to be found to have been part  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:28):**  of the problem when we look back at this. And they're going to have to have a review  of how they behave in situations like this. But that'll be for the whole of society to  decide on once this is over. I think this is a rapidly emerging situation. Most people  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:09:44):**  saw, were hoping at least at the beginning of March for this month that it was really  still a problem from but and on the other side of the world that it would be easily  contained. There was sort of hope while our government and medical experts were getting  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:00):**  to grips with working out the best response or the correct response, we were all having  you know, crossing our fingers that they would find a way of shutting it down. That isn't  the case. That's not been the reality. So I think it's unrealistic to think that we  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:17):**  wouldn't have some bumps and bangs in the situation that's emerging as rapidly as this.  And I think to answer the question on food, approximately, I think I might be saying 40%  of meals in the UK are eaten outside of the home. And in the current situation that the  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:35):**  ability to source those meals has been switched off as we've been shut out of pubs as we've  been encouraged in the early phase to distance socially, and we're now for enforce in that  social distancing. So this the food chain's got a huge reset to do in terms of getting  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:10:52):**  those raw material food products, those basic food products moving from the food service  through the restaurant chain and into the retail chain. So I think I think the retailers  response so far has been substantive, they're hiring more people that food will find its  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:08):**  way into people's homes. But you know, to suddenly think that that can be flipped, that  switch can be flipped overnight, I think, you know, was is again, it's a media field  fantasy. And therefore, the shortages we see, I think, are for the time being a short term,  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:23):**  because the food is out there. I think the question which none of us can answer is it  depends how much impact this has on the working population as we go through the harvest, the  vegetable and fruit harvest throughout the rest of the year.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:36):**  Precisely that that's, that's, you know, that that is the really important point, isn't  it? Because I think, you know, you're right, the retailers have responded, you're right,  of course, that people are now not eating out. So they're eating more homes are perhaps  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:11:47):**  some of that element of there being less food on the shelves is because people are just  catering more at home. But at the same time, you know, we've both poked our fingers at  the media and said, you know, they're ramping up the jeopardy and that doesn't help. But  
**[0:12:01-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:01):**  at the same time, we're, we're seeing, you know, news releases, news articles coming  out inspired by the NFU, etc, saying we're not going to be able to bring in the harvest,  therefore, there is going to be this food crisis in the future.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:12):**  Yeah, I think I think then if you're right to raise the fact that we, we have got a problem  in terms of identifying where that labour force is currently going to come from, I think  in the same ways that we've been able to increase the capacity of feet and hands in the National  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:28):**  Health Service, you know, it's not beyond the wit of hand to think that society won't  step up and you know, ensure we get the harvest in not just here, but across Europe. So I  think the NFU are absolutely right to flag this early doors in this crisis, but I'm hopeful  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:42):**  that we'll find sources of labour and be in a position to respond to that. And I think,  you know, government can play its part in, you know, encouraging people to, you know,  help in that sector as things unfold. But I, again, I think it's, I, you know, I am  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:12:57):**  weary of frightening consumers and frightening the population. I think we, you know, we need  to be calm about this now. We're all having our lives impacted, and we're all going to  have to do different things going forward. And some of that may be contributing to picking  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:10):**  vegetables. But again, reality check is we, you know, we only grow something like 30%  of our fruit and vegetables in this country currently. We are also extremely reliant on  our European neighbours to, you know, to maintain that source of supply. So we need to be thinking  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:27):**  of how we work with them intelligently through this period.  And at the same time, you know, if we're talking about our neighbours, you know, out to the  rest of Europe, they're going through a similar situation where people again, are shopping  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:41):**  in order to eat more in their own homes. And so are we not likely to see a sort of greater  level of nationalism sort of creeping in around those food supplies. So, you know, France  or Germany or Spain or whoever will be wanting to maintain the food that they have to reduce,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:13:56):**  reduce exports to places like Britain. And so, you know, there's the potential for, you  know, if we're only producing 30% of the fruit and veg that we have here, then we might find  it quite difficult going forwards to source from other countries if they are starting  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:11):**  to be more restrictive about those exports. And then just as another question to load  in there for you to respond to, is that issue around processes and packers. And if we start  to see significant numbers of workers in a process, in a meat processing plant, for example,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:28):**  going off with Coronavirus, whether there are the people to step in, especially the  slightly more skilled jobs, you know, it's different, perhaps, you know, spending a morning  learning how to pick potatoes, to learning how to use some of the more complicated machines  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:42):**  that need to be used in processing plants.  Well, I think to deal with the first part of that question, there seems to have been  generally less panic buying on the continent than we've had here, or what's been characterised  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:14:54):**  as panic buying, I think they're suffering from the same challenges of shifting. And  actually, I don't think you should underplay, it's not a question of people are eating a  bit less out and a lot more in the reality is we're all eating everything in there where  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:07):**  we're locked down and as increasing parts of Europe are locked down 100% of food is  being consumed in the home. That's a huge logistical change for those supply chains.  It's been interesting in the UK, you know, people are short of milk in the retail, but  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:21):**  the price for milk, you know, there are dairy farmers now there, they can't shift their  product because they've been supplying restaurants. And it takes a bit of time for that supply  to be resolved. But you know, going back to the original question is that the food is  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:34):**  still there, it's still being produced, we just need to redirect it in the supply chains.  To answer your second point in terms of maintaining the flow through the supply chain, I think,  you know, one of the things that's become evident for people who don't understand the  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:15:48):**  food supply chain that at times like this, in fact, at all times, people in the food  supply chain from farmers through the processors through the lorries drivers, the distribution  of logistics companies are key workers that support society on hourly basis, we're buying  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:04):**  food often many of our urban population, they have very little in the house, and they buy  their food on the way home from work for the evening meal. And we've got used to living  that way. And we're able to live that way because of the sophisticated food supply chain  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:20):**  that we have, we have an amazing diet these days, we can source fresh food every day.  But at times like that, that is a threat to us because fresh food goes off very quickly.  And it's something we've been advocating access to fresh food and vegetables. But the bit  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:36):**  that gets forgotten sometimes is they don't store for very long. And I think that's something  that's going to need to be thought about. At the end of this, when we come out of it  is a is a balance in terms of food people talking about food stocks, well, you can't  
**[0:16:48-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:48):**  store fresh broccoli for very long.  I'm interested, Joe, you're sort of taking on what Roland's mentioned there, and how  the retailers could could do better to help because I, you know, I hear what Roland says  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:16:59):**  that the retailers have responded, they've responded pretty quickly, they've made sure  that there's, you know, food coming in as far as possible, where I would criticize the  retailers is in the way that they have been expecting customers to behave. So for example,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:14):**  I was, you know, I was quite surprised shocked even how slow it took retailers to to enforce  that social distancing that was necessary to make sure that touchscreens were wiped  down. You know, it really wasn't until the lockdown happened officially that they began  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:28):**  doing that certainly in in the area around me. So if people are going in, and we have  these challenges, as Roland said, in in the city, at least, and you know, and I mean,  I live in rural Dorset, and I still, you know, do this to an extent you buy on a day to day  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:42):**  basis. And so it's not just that people are starting to have to plan and and think for  a bit longer. It's, you know, it's a really big change. And are there things that retailers  could do, you know, more proactively to help people change their behaviors, I don't know,  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:17:56):**  with recipes or suggesting store foods that are good making sure that they're promoting  those store foods and getting more of those in place.  I think that's really important point because people in as Roland's highlighted, you know,  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:09):**  people in certain situations may well live on a day to day basis in terms of buying their  food. We still live very, very much of a convenience food society where the ready meal is something  or the quick meal is something that we utilize. And for many, because of their lifestyles,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:27):**  actually cooking up something from scratch is quite an alien concept. And actually, that's  not that's because of the pressures of life and work. But we're in a very different situation  at this moment in time. And it does present an opportunity for people to upskill. And  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:41):**  this is where that the retailers could well support people, because it's the situation  of actually how you utilize your feeds, you get the most out of it, we're reducing waste,  and that people can try and maintain a healthy diet, but actually using what's in the shop  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:18:57):**  at the time, rather than going down the line of what they have habitually purchased in  the price in the past, we're very habitual animals in terms of kind of our shopping and  purchasing behaviors. So it's very easy to just to walk into the shop and go to the same  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:12):**  aisles and pick up the same things. But when you're confronted with not being there, it's  the it's the kind of where do you go next. And this is where the shops and retailers  could well support people from a point of view of giving them suggestions of how to  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:26):**  cook the produce that's in the shops, how to deal with how to process that how to it's  right from the scratch, actually, with some of these, the fruit and vegetables, you know,  it's how you cook it and and how you can utilize it. One of the things I've learned since I've  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:43):**  been in lockdown is how you can use kitchen scraps to start growing your own vegetables.  And it's something I've never even really looked into before. So actually, avoiding  waste, there's many different areas that the retakes can positively support people in.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:19:58):**  It's really very interesting, isn't it that there is the way that you know, this is a  this is a crisis that nobody really predicted or certainly that governments never modeled  for. And so there's been very little thought in advance. And this is just it's an unfolding  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:13):**  crisis with government responding, responding, responding. And all the time, it's it's very  difficult when you're simply responding to think outside the box. And, and if we were,  you know, three years out, we knew this pandemic was coming, and we were planning for it, then  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:28):**  I imagine that we do things in very different ways. And we were talking before the podcast  started about schools and the way that you know, work is being sent home. And when you  were talking there, Joe, I was just sort of thinking about the way in which perhaps there  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:40):**  is an opportunity here for government to think a bit more laterally. And instead of simply  trying to make sure that kids keep up with especially in primary school level, keep up  with the work that they would have been doing if they were at school thinking, well, how  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:20:53):**  can we utilize this resource that we have to educate, you know, the the information  that's going home, not just to kids, but to parents, to help them relearn how to cook  how to how to use scraps, to communicate different ways of dealing with food and thinking about  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:09):**  food, growing food at home, and actually bringing some of these different agencies together  to work more productively.  I mean, it is a fantastic opportunity from a point of view of being able to reach children  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:22):**  and and also support their parents from a point of view of our while the whole family,  in many cases, are all stuck together at home, it provides activities that are helping children  to learn about the world around them about how that they can have skills that will be  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:38):**  useful to them as they grow up in terms of what they're eating, how where it comes from,  how they how they can grow it, how they they can have a healthy diet, it can it has many  different levels that it can engage a population. And when we're looking at habits and behaviors  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:21:55):**  that we want to last into adulthood, primary aged children, that's that's kind of one of  the most important ages to get to, I think was it by seven to nine years old, many of  our habits have formed. So if those children are at home, learning how to cook, learning  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:10):**  what local produce they can use and where they can access it from, that's the amazing  gift to come out of of this very difficult time.  So nature has gifted us an opportunity to create a whole new generation of food citizens,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:24):**  if we, you know, if we if we think slightly more creatively. Roland, I want to get into  the negative aspects and then come back to the positive, we're going to talk about some  of the really good stuff to come out of it in a moment. But just before we do that, what  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:38):**  are the factors that you think could lead to a real worsening of the situation, a worsening  of food availability?  I think in the short term, in relation to this situation, maintaining enough key workers  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:22:51):**  for nations to be cooperating is critical. I see I see that happening in Europe. And  hopefully, I think I think also between ourselves in Europe. And that's important because we're  going to need to we're going to need to do that. I think the key work thing is important  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:08):**  is that people are not used to thanking the person at the Clicking Collectors Sainsbury's  for just being there. I think that's something we can do as consumers is to when we when  with our bin men, you know, the NHS is an obvious one. And obviously they're on the  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:24):**  front line and taking the you know, the real heat of this. But without those guys moving  out, you know, food around, we don't eat. So I think one of the things we need to do  is say thank you look them in the eye and thank them for being there. I think it's difficult  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:37):**  to predict how this is going to roll out. But I think governments are recognising that  you know, anyone involved in the food chain is a key worker. And that's critical that  that recognition is consolidated now and to ensure that there is enough there are enough  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:23:50):**  people on deck. I'm not too worried. And to be honest, again, I'm not one for peddling  fear in these situations. I don't think it's helpful. I think we need to grit our teeth  and you know, commit to helping each other. And if there is a shortage of workers, we're  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:02):**  going to need to request, you know, a volunteer force, although I think in this case, that  volunteer force will can expect to get paid if they're feeding us. So I think that's the  short term risk in all of this. I think that's the most obvious one is that just enough people  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:15):**  taking the processing factories and on some of those jobs that they're to do them,  There are sort of counterintuitive elements within that as well, though, aren't there  in the idea of a volunteer force, you know, when we talk about a force that suggests to  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:28):**  me a large body of people. And at the same time, we're being told to social distance  the whole time that we can't go within two metres of people. So if we're if we're then  talking about if I think of my own responses and my own family, I feel more fearful today  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:24:44):**  than I did a week ago, probably than I did a week before that, you know, I've got to  the stage now because this is drummed into us and it's become it's and it's really fascinating  how quickly the human brain adapts. But when I'm walking down the street, and and you know,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:00):**  one of my kids reaches out to hold my hand, my first instinct is to sort of slightly pull  away and then I remember that it's my child and it's and it's not somebody else walking  down the street and I don't need to worry about it. But there's there's sort of these  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:10):**  little things that are creeping in. So the idea of of getting loads of people out there,  it sort of kind of flies in the face of what we're being told to do.  I think I think, you know, again, I would go back to the to the head of this is that  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:24):**  this is a this has been a rapidly emerging situation. So I think for us to be somewhat  confused by our own behaviours and how we should be reaction is perfectly normal. So  I wouldn't beat yourself up too much over that. The analogy I would use when I was a  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:39):**  young man, I went and worked in Australia and I ended up in a in the south east of South  Australia on one job. And I it's a very big snake area or it certainly was then, you know,  you would see snakes pretty much every day. And you know, some of them could give you  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:25:53):**  a pretty nasty time of it if you got hit. And the first week I was there, I was I was  a sort of nervous wreck. Let's put it that way between the spiders and the snakes. I  thought, God, how does anyone live in this environment? And what the most amazing thing  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:07):**  was watching my own behaviour from 10 days into that. Looking back at how relaxed I was,  I'd learned to kick things. I'd worked out how to live in that environment very quickly.  And I think we're going through that now. I think social distancing is something none  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:22):**  of us are skilled at because we haven't needed to have that skill. We now need to acquire  it. We need to work out how to conduct it. My wife and I went for a dog walk yesterday  and I think we probably passed 10 to a dozen couples or runners, etc. 100% of those people  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:39):**  ensured that they were at two metres spacing from us. There wasn't a single failure. It  was impressive how quickly people have adapted. So, you know, I think, you know, give it another  two or three weeks, we'll all get used to working out how to do that. We went to Sainsbury's  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:26:53):**  this morning to pick up shopping and the guys there are operating a social distancing system  very effectively. It's impressive how quickly we are able to adapt. But, you know, quick  though it is, it still takes a few days and it takes a while to work it out for ourselves.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:08):**  So it will normalise, I guess, as we go forwards. And I suppose, Jo, kind of coming back to  you, that sort of human behaviour element, the more the government locks down, perhaps  the amount that we're allowed to go outside, the keener we will be to take an opportunity  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:23):**  to get out and spend some additional time in the fields picking leaks.  Yeah, again, that's another opportunity, isn't it? From the point of view of being able to  help. And I think there's a lot of evidence around volunteering and how good it is for  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:37):**  your mental health and your mental wellbeing. That coupled with the evidence around getting  out in nature and physical exercise for all physical and mental wellbeing. I think the  opportunities to support and help with food production does offer an opportunity there  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:27:55):**  that could be utilized. I think one of the challenges is how there's a lot of talk about  those working in small businesses and small enterprises, self-employed, those working  in the gig economy and what will happen with them. And it's potential, there is a potential  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:12):**  opportunity there, but it's how you can connect those workers who may not be living in rural  areas to those who are in need from a point of view of farms and the need to keep our  food systems working. So I think there are opportunities, but there's a bit of a challenge  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:30):**  there about kind of how you're going to link those systems together.  That's a really interesting point. And I wonder, Roland, you know, from your experience within,  you know, these sort of larger companies, is that a role, is there a role there for  
**[0:28:40-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:40):**  government or is there a role there for business? Whose responsibility is it to connect up those  people who are freelancers or people who've been furloughed working in the gig economy  to recruit them and get them out there into the fields if and as and when that's necessary?  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:28:56):**  Well, I think the answer is both. And I think particularly when we're under an enforced  lockdown government's got to play a very significant role in working out how that's done because  we're, you know, we're under some fairly draconian rules right now. So, but, you know, hotels  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:11):**  are empty in these rural areas. What I'm trying to say is that there are assets that can be  utilised to facilitate, you know, a local labour force in these areas. You know, it  can be done. It's just a question of working out how best to do it, how to do it fairly  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:29):**  because, you know, we can't forcibly put people at increased risk. I don't see there's any  reason for that in the food chain. I think it's quite possible to, you know, keep risk  at a very reasonable level. I mean, there is no such thing as zero risk. You know, we've  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:41):**  all got to go out and get food or transfer it into our homes. You know, there's risk  attached to everything in relation to something, you know, something like this virus. I think  one of the things that needs saying about the, we shouldn't judge our food chain, you  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:29:55):**  know, from singular situations like the coronavirus, because you could say at the moment, if you  say, well, you know, what's the weak link in the current situation? And it's the long  distance transport of food. We're reliant on other nations. We're not in control of  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:08):**  their health system. So you can very quickly paint a picture of where, you know, local  supply in the current situation is important. And I would support that. I think we do need  to decentralise our food system over the coming decades. I do think we need to grow more food  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:22):**  locally for health reasons and for food security reasons. But, and there is a but, is that  we do need to maintain a trading food because the weakest link on the back of a typhoon  or a flood, you know, or a very wet harvest in one part of the world means that if we  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:39):**  have a trading food system, we can source food from elsewhere. If that trading system,  if we were just local, as would have been the case, you know, in medieval, pre-medieval  times, if the harvest failed, people died. And one of the great things about our international  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:30:55):**  food system is that we can move food commodities around the world to where they're needed.  And I think we, you know, we need to recognise it's, there's two ends to this equation. It  depends on the situation as to what the weakest link is on what's perceived to be the strongest  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:09):**  element of any existing food chain. I think there is a need to rebalance. I think there  is a need to decentralise, but I don't think that we should think that, you know, trading  food globally is all bad. It certainly is not.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:22):**  So there's a book that came out recently written by Tim Lang, which has been, you know, much,  much promoted certainly in the pages of The Guardian and around social media, around the  idea that, you know, the food system is broken and coronavirus certainly, I mean, I doubt  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:38):**  it's in the book, but it's certainly in the PR around the book that this shows us that  the food system really needs fundamental change from the inside out, from one side to the  other. And what you're saying is that actually you think that the food system is responding  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:31:54):**  reasonably well, that there is a certain level of robustness and that yes, change is needed,  but it's a rebalancing and a much more nuanced approach.  Yeah, I think it's, I think the food system needs to evolve. I don't think it is, you  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:07):**  know, a hundred percent fit for purpose at all currently. I think we, we need to think  of food, not just as something as fuel, but also as nutrition. I think that that whole  conversation is evolving in terms of our own, you know, our own health and our own burden  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:22):**  on the health system, et cetera. So I think as I say, I'm a, I'm an advocate of a steady  decentralization of food processes, but you know, I think there are dangers that either  extreme of sort of localization and globalization and the happy medium definitely sits somewhere  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:39):**  in between and we need to design that happy medium. I'm also, although I would, I agree  with and sometimes a lot of the conclusions that academics and who have concerns over  the food chain, I object to people saying the food system is broken. I think that's  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:32:54):**  a ridiculous statement because it's quite evidently not. People get fed every day and  even in this crisis at the moment, that's still the case. Is it a hundred percent fit  for purpose with 7.5 billion plus people on the planet? No, I think we, there are things  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:08):**  we still need to do, but I think three years ago I think it was the first time more people  died of obesity than they did a malnutrition. So it's difficult to say that we've got a  problem with food in terms of production and access to it at a macro level. Of course there  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:24):**  are individual situations where people are struggling to feed themselves even in our,  well that's another term I object to is food poverty. I certainly in countries like the  UK, you know, it's a ludicrous statement. There is no such thing as food poverty. There  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:37):**  is just poverty. And if people have enough money, food is 8% of our average salary. If  people are struggling to buy enough food, it's because they don't have enough money,  not because food is too cheap. We've only got a few minutes left and I kind of want  
**[0:33:52-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:33:52):**  to end on a positive note. We're seeing a big resurgence in localism as a result of  the pandemic where people certainly in more rural areas are noticing that pressure on  the big retailers. They're suddenly finding their local farm shop, their local independent  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:10):**  food network and they're tapping into those. You know, when I went to the local farm shop,  which is only about quarter of a mile away from where I live, I'm very lucky. You know,  sometimes the queues are out of the door where ordinarily, you know, they're perhaps waiting  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:24):**  for customers from one 20 minutes to the next. So that's a really positive thing. People  have rediscovered these local networks and these local producers. Do you think that we'll  be able to maintain that interest in those producers after the pandemic has finished  
**[0:34:40-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:40):**  and we're looking at it in that rear view mirror?  I don't know the answer to that, Finlow. I think only time will tell whether it'll be  maintained. I think the interesting question almost, you know, after the pandemic, but  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:34:53):**  in any case, is the world is moving to an urban, to urban living. More people live in  cities than don't now. So when we talk about sourcing from a local farm shop, I think that's  true of those of us that are lucky enough to live in the countryside or close to it.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:09):**  But the majority of people don't live next to farm shops. I think the challenge is how  do we, how do we redefine local food? I think it's more to do with connecting the producer  and the consumer on an ongoing basis because, you know, consumers need producers. They need  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:26):**  people to commit to growing crops and to producing food. And there's a long lead time before  food gets on the table for a farmer who's taking, putting that crop in the ground or  that, you know, those animals into the system. There can be three year lead time before they  
**[0:35:43-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:43):**  see a return from that decision. And the crazy thing about the food chain is that we all  know we're going to eat. We all know pretty much what sort of things we're going to eat,  but we don't commit to it. So we, I think we need to de-risk the food chain by removing  
**[0:35:57-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:35:57):**  some of that sort of commercial trading element to at least some of the core, our core diet,  wherever we are in the world. I think we should be looking at 60% of our core diet being committed  because we're going to eat it anyway.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:09):**  I suppose we're always going to need pasta. We're always going to need spuds. We know  that we're going to want vegetables even if we're not entirely certain exactly which vegetable  we want. And so, I mean, I think that's a, that's a whole nother podcast, isn't it?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:23):**  I think the other thing to add though, it, yes, we are going to need those, but we're  going to also need products that you can store. It's all very, everyone's talking about fresh  food and vegetables and fruit, et cetera, but we need products we can store to keep  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:35):**  resilience in the food chain. And that's something that needs thinking. If we just go to just,  just in time, fresh food all the time and something goes wrong, our fuel supply falls  away and the crop fails in the case of some of this urbanised production that's coming  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:36:51):**  through now, or we have, as I say, bad harvests, we need to fall back on foods that can be  stored preferably at ambient, and can be stored for long periods of time.  Joe, just finally, going back to you, that question of trying to make sure that this  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:06):**  resurgent interest in local shops for those people who are within range of them and the  use of local food networks, for example, in Oxford, even though it's an urban centre,  there's, you know, there are good networks of food producers bringing food into people  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:22):**  in the city there. What do you think that producers can do if they're listening to this  podcast to make sure that they keep hold of those customers in the future?  I think if we look at some of the evidence around how supermarkets have utilised our  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:40):**  human behaviour over the years, we can learn some really useful lessons. So people are,  as I think I mentioned earlier, they're very habitual in their behaviours in terms of purchasing,  but the times when those habits get shaken, and if you think about 40 to 45% of our daily  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:37:57):**  yet behaviours are habitual, habits are very, very hard to break. But the things that change  our habits are when very significant events occur in our lives. So this is why the supermarkets  target us when we move house or people are having children, and the marketing material  
**[0:38:16-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:16):**  comes through to buy certain items that might relate to your change in circumstance. We  can also think about this in the fact that people are changing their behaviours, they're  changing habits that have been very fixed for a long time. They're having to do that  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:30):**  because of the circumstance at the moment. And it's had to be about building on that  and encouraging people from a point of view of what's in it for them, why do they support  their local businesses. And if they build up that relationship, they can see value in  
**[0:38:46-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:38:46):**  the produce that they can obtain. I think there is every chance that that can be continued  moving forwards because people are not there receptive to doing something different because  their behaviours have been changed very dramatically because of this.  
**[0:39:00-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:00):**  So there's something about learning from the way that the big retailers have promoted themselves,  trying to perhaps to actively capture some of the data of people coming through so that,  you know, in times to come, those producers and farm shops are able to remind the customers  
**[0:39:17-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Panic-buying---a-rational-reaction-to-crisis-ec6imp#t=0:39:17):**  who came to them during the pandemic that they still exist to let them know what they've  got in the shop. Look, we're out of time. And I'm not panicking, but I do need to go  to the shops. So I'm going to I'm going to cut us off there. I'd like to say thank you

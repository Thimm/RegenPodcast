**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke stain, the chief executive of Farmwell and  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. My guest today is Jane Buxton. Jane has written  novels and nonfiction, published articles in the Independent and the Guardian, and has  
**[0:00:19-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:00:19):**  been an ambassador for the Real Food Campaign and the Public Health Collaboration. In her  most recent book, The Great Plant-Based Con, Jane explains why she thinks that eating a  plant-only diet won't improve our health or save the planet. Jane, welcome. Thanks  
**[0:00:33-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:00:33):**  so much for joining me. Let's start with an easy question. Why did you want to write  this book in the first place? Back in about 2019, early 2019, I started  to notice a great intensification in the plant-based messaging and the ubiquitousness of that message  
**[0:00:52-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:00:52):**  that we all needed to become vegan and plant-based was going to solve all our problems. And I  also noticed that much of the data which was being used by those advocates were, it just  didn't resemble the data that I knew of. It jarred with me. So I started to do a lot  
**[0:01:09-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:01:09):**  of research to get deeper into this. And then I remember the movie Game Changers came out.  And A, it was a film that was based on a lot of nonsense science, which I knew to be nonsense.  And B, a lot of young people were deciding to give veganism a go on the back of it, even  
**[0:01:28-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:01:28):**  some older people as well. And I felt this was very dangerous and that there could be  a human health catastrophe in the making if we went too far down that road. So that's  when I got serious and approached my agent and said, we need to do a book on this.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:01:43):**  I'm interested in the way that you talk about, you know, being confronted with what you call  bad science and data that jarred. Now I'm interested in this because when we sort of  hear other people on the other side of this argument, making the case that we shouldn't  
**[0:01:59-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:01:59):**  have any meat and dairy, that we should clear animals off the land and that, you know, instead  we just all need to go plant-based, whatever that means, whether that's plants from the  land or plants that have been processed in the lab, they think that their science is  
**[0:02:11-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:02:11):**  good. You think that your science is good. Why is that? Why does that disconnect exist?  How can we tell when science is good quality?  I think we have to rely, we either have to do the analysis ourselves or we have to rely  
**[0:02:25-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:02:25):**  on people we trust to do that analysis. For instance, how do we tell whether the old claims  that were made by Cowspiracy, that livestock was responsible for 50% of emissions and that  claim is still used today. We still see it on the placards of people who are protesting  
**[0:02:43-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:02:43):**  against dairy and whatever. So how do we know if that's true? Well, we have to go back to  the source and of course you do a little digging and you realise that that was not true and  the science was very questionable. So then you say, well, okay, the alternatives are  
**[0:02:57-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:02:57):**  being put forward by the FAO. Do we trust the FAO? I think you have to look to your  source. You have to examine the factors that they're using and make a judgement. Now I  appreciate that that's not easy for people to do. One of the reasons I wanted to write  
**[0:03:12-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:03:12):**  the book in a kind of very layperson friendly way, I'm orienting it towards the popular  audience rather than necessarily the scientific audience. It was because of the need to translate  and to give people the tools to look at the science themselves.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:03:29):**  I'm interested in the way that headline writers work with articles that go into the press  and you've highlighted various different points in your book. The way in which a science paper  has been misrepresented, first of all, it's been slightly misrepresented perhaps by the  
**[0:03:45-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:03:45):**  journalist, but the journalist has often been pretty good. They've, you know, they've  gone to the source, but then the headline writer seems to have taken something which  is a huge leap. Why does that happen? I mean, you know, you've worked within the media.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:03:59):**  Why does that process take place? I don't think it's any ill intent at play  here. I think that it's the speed with which they have to operate. It's the need to fill  newspapers with startlingly interesting headlines every single day. That leads them to take  
**[0:04:16-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:04:16):**  shortcuts and these journalists are not, and the headline writers are also not specialists,  so they don't interrogate the studies at all. They rely on a press release, which as you  said, may in itself distort the findings of the study. And I'm sure you're referring to  
**[0:04:33-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:04:33):**  one of the studies in my book where it was claimed that you could get a 50% longer life  if you ate a vegan diet. And when I wrote to the author, he said, no, that claim is  not based on any data in my study. So it's pretty clear that that's what happens. I was  
**[0:04:51-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:04:51):**  struck also, I was listening to one of your discussions about carbon tunnel vision yesterday.  It was a discussion, it was excellent discussion about how something like say the poor and  Nemechek study gets so embedded in our consciousness. So what starts out, and I think you made this  
**[0:05:08-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:05:08):**  point, it starts out as a study which is putting a point of view out there. Other scientists  counter it, there are other metrics which are used to alter and adjust those conclusions.  It's far from definitive. And yet it gets positioned in the newspaper, in The Economist  
**[0:05:25-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:05:25):**  or something equally prestigious as the definitive view. Even though scientists are still challenged,  even though the original scientists may be redoing some of their work, that gets picked  up by other media. Pretty soon it's cited by everybody. Pretty soon that study is also  
**[0:05:42-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:05:42):**  cited by other researchers who just take its conclusions as given. So you get this buildup  of something which is founded actually sometimes on a house of cards, but it's being cited  everywhere and that's how the plan happens. That's how we get into this situation where  
**[0:05:57-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:05:57):**  people are being told something and they're convinced it's true. They're convinced it's  the single perspective when it actually it's not, it's one of many.  And interestingly in terms of that Pouren Nemechek paper, I think that the discussion  
**[0:06:10-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:06:10):**  that I was having there was with Adele from Sustainable Food Trust who was making the  point that actually there were five sort of key points, five critical metrics that Pouren  Nemechek were working with, but it was just one of those metrics that had then been taken.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:06:25):**  So a paper that was to an extent reductionist in itself because you can't deal with everything  in a single academic paper had then become increasingly reductionist beyond that because  that was what was picked up by the press and in fact on that occasion by our world in data,  
**[0:06:40-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:06:40):**  which in many ways is a really highly respected institution in its own right.  One of the other conversations that we were having is about the way that science is self-correcting  even if it takes a number of years and that that process of self-correction is taking  
**[0:06:57-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:06:57):**  place currently where Pouren Nemechek did a piece of work. They're now reflecting on  some of the distortions that communicating that work created and they're working with  others now to try and correct that. Does the media work in the same way? Is there a self-correcting  
**[0:07:15-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:07:15):**  element within the media itself or is it just that these stories, these misconceptions actually  just snowball because there isn't an element of self-correction?  I think you've nailed it. I think that is the problem. There isn't enough of a self-correcting  
**[0:07:32-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:07:32):**  tendency in the media. I mean I can't tell you how many letters I've written to papers  and television programme producers alerting them to the inaccuracies in some of their  presentation of the facts. If you hear back you're lucky. If you get a correction it'll  
**[0:07:51-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:07:51):**  be in the back pages where nobody sees it and most of the time they're still running  so fast they just don't have time and so you're right that shift that may be happening over  time in science quite slowly happens even more slowly in the press. And then the other  
**[0:08:07-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:08:07):**  juxtaposition you need to put there is that the policy is being made now. It's being made  on the basis of the science so that poor Nemechek study it has been used to make policy which  is then feeding through our system, our food system. So it's all working at different paces  
**[0:08:27-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:08:27):**  and I'm not sure what the answer is except that I do believe it would serve us all much  better if the media took more time to interrogate and reflect if they applied specialists to  these pieces when they're assigning that work.  
**[0:08:42-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:08:42):**  And it's interesting isn't it I suppose because ultimately scientists are searching for truth  and so there is a desire for that self-correction because it helps to get closer to truth whatever  truth is whereas journalists and headline writers perhaps in particular and editorial  
**[0:09:00-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:09:00):**  teams they're ultimately trying to sell newspapers and they're trying to serve their readership  and although there is this desire for truth clearly you know obviously within you know  journalism and the media more broadly the most important thing is selling the newspaper  
**[0:09:14-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:09:14):**  and so that to an extent takes priority I suppose. But moving on just let's talk about  the book's title The Great Plant-Based Con. Now that's quite provocative the word con  in retrospect do you feel that it may have stopped some people reading the book who actually  
**[0:09:29-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:09:29):**  really needed to?  I think it will undoubtedly have stopped some people from reading it and it'll also have  made some people angry. It's poking the bear a little bit but it was a conscious decision  
**[0:09:40-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:09:40):**  I had that title as my working title all the way through I thought the publishers would  ask me to change it they didn't and we had a long discussion about it and we felt that  in order to make some headway in this discussion we needed something that would sort of wake  
**[0:09:54-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:09:54):**  people up so it's a wake me up title and get them to look further and to be honest it says  exactly what's on the tin because I talk about the con I dissect it I try to get people to  understand and I'm not saying it's a con in the in the sense of a confidence trickster  
**[0:10:12-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:10:12):**  and maybe we can get into that a little bit later but it is the truth of what I'm trying  to say and I was really not aiming to draw in people who are already committed to the  opposite point of view I didn't think they would read it and I don't think their minds  
**[0:10:26-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:10:26):**  will be changed by it. I was really aiming for that group of people that I call the confused  middle who've been subjected to this barrage of constant one-sided information who maybe  are worried themselves about their own diet what they should do what should they feed  
**[0:10:42-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:10:42):**  their children and I wanted to give them something to grab on to so it was really them that I'm  writing for.  But in terms of your own PR in terms of being able to get the message out there and sell  
**[0:10:52-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:10:52):**  the book it's it's become a bit of an Achilles heel in places hasn't it you you've not always  got the coverage that you would have liked.  Yeah yeah I mean it's been surprising so you know somebody like Philip and Holly on Good  
**[0:11:06-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:11:06):**  Morning picks it up and we have a lovely seven minute conversation about it so they weren't  put off by it maybe it appealed to something I think that they had a personal view on the  issue but then there are other radio stations who for whatever reason for wanting to protect  
**[0:11:22-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:11:22):**  their audience not to offend their audience or just to stay clear of the debate they have  just refused to cover it not because they think it's wrong necessarily but because it's  just too hot to handle and of course the title is too hot to handle. I'm not sure the title  
**[0:11:38-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:11:38):**  made any difference in their willingness to cover it though. I think it was just they  don't want to get into this because the zeitgeist is so strong in favour of plant based that  for some people it's just too dangerous to counter it.  
**[0:11:49-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:11:49):**  And I wonder where that danger lies I guess that comes back to that previous conversation  around science that often journalists you know they're working on tight turnarounds  and so in a radio programme for example if they're not confident in their own ability  
**[0:12:02-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:12:02):**  to fact check and they're concerned that they might be accused of peddling pseudoscience  themselves then I guess that's the threat the risk from their perspective.  It is the risk but I'm noticing that they don't hesitate to feature the other side so  
**[0:12:17-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:12:17):**  you know the book by George Monbiot was very merrily discussed on a central Radio 4 platform  so I still think that there's more of a bias against the perspective that I am putting  than there is against the other side.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:12:32):**  So what you're talking about here is part of a counter narrative but the mainstream  media is fixed in the current narrative and if you step outside the zeitgeist then it's  very very difficult to get that message across. That's really interesting. One of the accusations  
**[0:12:47-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:12:47):**  Jane that's levelled at anti-meat writers by people often within the farming sector  themselves is that they're activists they're dismissed as activists campaigning against  meat. Are you an activist for meat?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:12:59):**  People have accused me of being an activist for meat. They called me the meat lady that  kind of thing and they raged against that on occasion but in fact I'm an advocate for  omnivorous eating. I'm an advocate for historical eating pattern which is beneficial to human  
**[0:13:17-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:13:17):**  nutrition and welfare and which has its roots in ancestral diets so it's interesting that  that perspective is deemed to be so radical isn't it? I mean I'm really asking for an  appreciation of what we have always done and to understand the benefits that that has given  
**[0:13:34-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:13:34):**  us. In a way I'm surprised by where I've ended up because if you knew what I used to eat  I've always been historically as a baked potato and salad person. I would go to the steak  house with a group of people and I would have the baked potato and salad they'd all be eating  
**[0:13:47-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:13:47):**  the ribeyes. That was because that's the way I liked to eat and then as I became more aware  of the health benefits of eating enough protein and animal source food protein and my need  for that as I got older I shifted my diet but I haven't always been a person to eat  
**[0:14:04-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:14:04):**  a lot of meat so it's fairly ironic to be called a meat advocate.  I'm interested in what you say about historical eating patterns and of course one of the things  that's changed over the course of time is not just the way that we eat but the way that  
**[0:14:19-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:14:19):**  we understand food and we understand nutrition and now there's a huge amount of information  that exists telling us that perhaps the way we ate in the past wasn't as healthy as it  could have been. Is that something that you agree with?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:14:31):**  I agree that that's happening and that we have had this shift but it's interesting because  we're attributing new diseases, new epidemics, obesity and diabetes, type 2 diabetes for  instance and the heart disease epidemic that started to emerge in the 1950s. We're attributing  
**[0:14:49-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:14:49):**  those to old foods when in fact it's the new foods that have been increasing in consumption.  So meat consumption has gone down and say animal fat consumption has certainly gone  down since the 1950s and yet those diseases continue to escalate. So I think when you  
**[0:15:08-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:15:08):**  say that there's science is driving us to sort of condemn some of those old foods I  think it's a bit of pseudo-science and I think it's a desperate clinging to some sort of  explanation. I mean when you look at how quickly the American guidelines committees and the  
**[0:15:27-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:15:27):**  McGovern commission grabbed onto the idea that it was saturated fat that was the problem  and causing heart attacks in the 50s. They wanted to do something, they felt desperate  for a solution, they didn't have all the science but they grabbed this one theory and they  
**[0:15:42-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:15:42):**  ran with it and then it's like turning a great big tanker around. We are only just beginning  to turn it around. So we are getting studies coming pretty thick and fast now in the past  decade showing that saturated fat is not to be feared, it's not the culprit in heart disease  
**[0:16:01-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:16:01):**  and cancer that we've thought you know we've been led to believe.  This makes me think about the whole correlation and causation argument that people had around  smoking and the way in which the cigarette industry would say well you're talking about  
**[0:16:15-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:16:15):**  correlation but you haven't demonstrated causation and of course the way that science worked  then was that gradually that causation became harder and harder to dispute and what it sounds  to me like you're saying is that that people jumped on the correlation in terms of saturated  
**[0:16:32-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:16:32):**  fats for example and human disease but the increasingly the science is catching up and  demonstrating that that causation is less present, that it doesn't exist to the same  extent and perhaps even that it is disproved. Yes absolutely, absolutely. We've had a shift  
**[0:16:50-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:16:50):**  in what we accept as quality science in this area. So I have yet to see a study showing  say a link between meat and cancer or saturated fat and heart disease. I've yet to see one  that provides even correlations that are in any way comparable to the one between smoking  
**[0:17:12-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:17:12):**  and lung cancer. Those studies, the smoking lung cancer studies were providing correlations  in the order of risk factors of 10 to 30 times depending on the study and we now see on a  regular basis studies with risk factors of 1.1, 1.2 and most epidemiologists worth their  
**[0:17:34-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:17:34):**  salt say that that's absolutely not enough to prove any or to even indicate causation  and the Bradford Hill criteria say you shouldn't look at anything below 2. So we have this  whole industry built up on this science which is incredibly weak but we're basing our systems  
**[0:17:52-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:17:52):**  on this. We're basing our food system, our policies, we're basing our thinking about  diet on these studies and there are a couple of other things at play here too. First of  all the scientists whose studies are being reported by these journalists who have to  
**[0:18:08-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:18:08):**  fill their pages, right, they are also guilty of propagating conclusions which are really  based on very weak numbers and if they really sat down and looked at those numbers they  themselves would realise that a correlation of 1.01 is really meaningless. But that kind  
**[0:18:25-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:18:25):**  of science, that kind of epidemiological science has become an industry in itself. It needs  to keep itself going, it needs funding, it needs to, you know, these scientists need  to be paid. So they have an incentive to promote spectacular findings on the basis of weak  
**[0:18:42-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:18:42):**  data as well. Then there's something else happening which is beyond that daily need  and the daily falsehoods that are propagated in the media and it's the link between some  aspects of the media and funding sources, right, which is another big factor at play  
**[0:19:01-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:19:01):**  here. So for instance I'm not sure how many people know that the Guardian has taken funding  from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, has also taken over $2 million from an organisation  called OPP which… The Open Philanthropy Project.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:19:17):**  … which is really an animal welfare advocacy group. And those links, those financial links,  yes, they are written and acknowledged somewhere on the paper but you have to dig and dig,  you have to follow several links to understand what they mean. I don't think for one second  
**[0:19:33-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:19:33):**  that many people are doing that. Therefore people are under the impression that what  they're getting is semi-objective reporting. They might think it's slanted left or slanted  right but they'll think it's objective. In fact what they're getting is advocacy  
**[0:19:47-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:19:47):**  and we don't understand and we don't know the deals that were made about what the coverage  should be in return for those funds. But based on the evidence we see, we can see that the  Guardian is very anti-livestock most of the time, not all the time but most of the time.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:20:03):**  And I think it would be naive to think that the funding sources do not have anything to  do with that.  And the Guardian of course has this challenge. I mean it is one of the most popular newspapers  
**[0:20:15-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:20:15):**  online, formidable online global presence with over 35 million readers each month. But  it doesn't have a paywall which obviously is great because it means that everybody can  read it for free. But at the same time without a paying readership it's had to turn to these  
**[0:20:30-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:20:30):**  other sources of funding and as you say in this case it's philanthropic partnerships  and sponsored content. And I wonder what it is in particular that concerns you. Is it  the lack of transparency? Because I'm sure the Guardian would say that they are entirely  
**[0:20:44-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:20:44):**  transparent about this. You can see at the top of an article that it's sponsored by OPP,  Human Philanthropy Project or the Bell and Melinda Gates Foundation. But you then of  course have to go and find who these organisations are elsewhere. And so it feels like there's  
**[0:20:58-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:20:58):**  this broken link between the readership and the journalists and the organisations that  are now funding this. I don't think that the general public has understood that this transition  in the funding model has taken place to the extent that it has.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:21:12):**  I'm sure they haven't. So you're right. Technically speaking it is all above board and transparent.  Practically speaking less so. And as I will reiterate that we may see that those funding  links occur. What we don't know is the agreements that have been made as to the nature of the  
**[0:21:30-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:21:30):**  coverage which will flow as a result of that funding. It is not transparent in that sense.  And it's very different to think of reader support. So the Guardian also solicits donations  and subscriptions from readers who some of whom will oblige. And that's one thing. But  
**[0:21:47-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:21:47):**  these large organisations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with stated positions  on aspects of this debate, they are not ordinary readers. They're very powerful. And we are  not aware from our side of just as readers of the newspaper, we're not aware of the extent  
**[0:22:04-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:22:04):**  to which those large organisations can elicit certain sorts of coverage in the direction  that suits their advocacy stance on the basis of those donations.  And of course it may not even be as formal as particular agreements. I mean there may  
**[0:22:20-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:22:20):**  well be agreements about what will be, I'm sure there are, about what will be covered  and the way that those things will be covered. But there must also be editorial decisions  and journalistic decisions that are being taken on the assumption that they don't want  
**[0:22:33-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:22:33):**  to say something that's going to offend these big donors. And let's be clear, OPP, I mean  you describe them as an animal welfare activist group. And you know, animal welfare is an  important thing, it's an important part of it. But they are particularly prone to funding  
**[0:22:51-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:22:51):**  work within sort of vegan research and plant-based alternatives. And Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  is particularly interested in land sparing, in promoting solutions that are very fixed  on carbon emissions reduction. And so sort of fall into that carbon tunnel vision challenge  
**[0:23:08-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:23:08):**  that we were talking about in the past. Since we're talking about carbon emissions, shall  we move on to climate change? Because at COP27 recently, the UN Secretary General said we're  on a highway to climate hell. Do you accept that meat production and consumption are at  
**[0:23:26-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:23:26):**  the very least a part of the problem? I do accept that, yes. They are a part of  the problem. The way I think about it and would put it though is that meat consumption  and meat production is neither as big a part of the problem as we've been led to believe,  
**[0:23:42-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:23:42):**  nor is it as good as it could be. We're not capturing the potential of meat and meat production  to benefit the environment. So if I backtrack a bit and talk about the first half of that  statement, why do I think it's not as bad as we are led to believe? I think that's because  
**[0:23:59-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:23:59):**  the data which is regularly used exaggerates the carbonate impact, for instance, of meat.  So it's based on life cycle analysis, which is not the case in other sectors such as transport.  So you're getting a bigger number there. It's based on numbers which do not account for  
**[0:24:18-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:24:18):**  the sequestration effect of cattle on well-managed pasture, which is acknowledged and scientifically  proven as an actual benefit. It's based on GWP 100, not GWP star, which your listeners  are probably very au fait with that. And we know that that kind of metric can exaggerate  
**[0:24:39-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:24:39):**  the warming impact of livestock by three to four times. That has been acknowledged.  And in particular, the methane emissions. The methane emissions, yeah. And the other  way that these numbers are exaggerated is that they are global numbers. And we always  
**[0:24:53-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:24:53):**  hear about the 14.5% as a global figure. And that includes and accounts for factors which  actually aren't applicable in some particular countries like the UK. So there isn't, we  are not deforesting land in order to produce our beef here. So I think for all of those  
**[0:25:13-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:25:13):**  reasons, those numbers are misleading. I would say they overstate the effect. And I was absolutely  astonished just last week, and you may have seen it, a study came out about New Zealand  beef and lamb exported around the world. And they applied four different metrics, including  
**[0:25:32-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:25:32):**  GWP star. And the GWP star metrics put the carbon emissions from their beef at about  three kilos, I think per kilo. And it was 50% of any of the other estimates. And also,  let's be clear, that is a fraction of what poor Nemechek are saying beef emissions are.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:25:54):**  So we have this incredible vast gap between production systems in some countries and in  some on some farms, which are low carbon and these estimates which are incredibly high  carbon. I don't think that's very helpful to consumers when they're trying to make a  
**[0:26:09-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:26:09):**  decision about what they should be eating.  You talk about the way in which, you know, some of these numbers may be exaggerated.  And I'm reminded of the conversation we had with Dieter Helm, who suggested, and I think  
**[0:26:21-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:26:21):**  I think I'm representing what he said accurately, that when he, you know, looks out at the UK,  particularly when he's looking at fields that have been ploughed, where, you know, there  is very little vegetation, that what he sees is akin to an old coal fired power station,  
**[0:26:38-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:26:38):**  that those emissions have already been released. And you mentioned, you know, deforestation,  and that there isn't the deforestation ongoing here. But of course, that deforestation has  happened to an extent in the past. And, you know, that carbon legacy still exists. So  
**[0:26:53-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:26:53):**  I wonder if there's possibly a sense that these figures, you know, when we get down  to them, yes, they exaggerate the impact of ruminate methane, but perhaps they undersell  the amount of carbon emissions from just the way that land has been managed and soil has  
**[0:27:09-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:27:09):**  been degraded. And perhaps they average out at something that's roughly about right?  Ooh, roughly about right, except that we're building policy which encourages us to eradicate  one and to eat more of the other. So if you're talking about monocrop farming and the damage  
**[0:27:25-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:27:25):**  that that does to soil and the carbon released by that, as well as every other aspect of  our life, which takes land and builds on it, or if you're talking about the pollution from  that farming in rivers and whatnot, yeah, we're penalising livestock for actually what  
**[0:27:42-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:27:42):**  you should be looking instead is at production systems for any type of food. There are good  and bad ways of producing plants and animal foods. And we need to be striving for the  best, most environmentally friendly, agro-ecology friendly method of both of producing all of  
**[0:28:00-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:28:00):**  that food. And that's why the debate which just pits plants versus animals is really  very unhelpful in that way, because we need to look at the whole picture. And we also,  as you've rightly pointed out, need to look at something beyond carbon. And I was so interested  
**[0:28:17-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:28:17):**  to hear about, again, from Adele, from the Sustainable Food Trust, about the new metric  system that they're developing for farm, I can't remember the name of it.  The Global Farm Metric. That's right, which has 33 factors in 11 different  
**[0:28:31-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:28:31):**  categories. That's where we need to get to is looking at that level of complexity around  the food system and instead of these kind of broad brush statements, this food's bad,  that food's good. And of course, the issue that I was prodding  
**[0:28:43-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:28:43):**  out there is, you know, we can make all kinds of cases for what happened in history. We  can make all kinds of cases to say, well, the land was managed in this way and we can  make assumptions about the impacts that that may have had. But actually what we're dealing  
**[0:28:55-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:28:55):**  with is the here and now. And we can only measure what we can see and what we can accurately  define in the here and now. And that's one of the reasons why the Global Farm Metric  is so important, because, you know, it helps us to do that, helps us to understand the  
**[0:29:11-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:29:11):**  various different impacts on the land. I wonder when you think about the future and the needs  not only to address the crisis in nature, but also the crises in obesity and nutrition.  When you, I asked Dita this as well, but when you look out at Britain, what do you think  
**[0:29:30-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:29:30):**  the future of food production should look like?  Should look like, whether it will is another question, but you know, in an ideal world,  we should start with what people need. So food should be about what humans need. And  
**[0:29:42-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:29:42):**  I think we need to move to a food system based on people consuming more real food. And I  mean unadulterated food. And I'm not alone in thinking this. I mean, Henry Dibbleby's  food strategy has pointed out that we have 50% of our calories are coming from ultra-processed  
**[0:29:57-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:29:57):**  foods. We need to reel back from that. So then you have to say, well, how do we get  people eating more real food? That's about the education system. It's also about the  incentive system. So we need to be looking at the point in the supply chain where we  
**[0:30:12-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:30:12):**  have leverage to incentivize people to produce food in a certain way, that's both good for  health and good for the environment and to sell it and then to consume it. So somewhere  along that supply chain, we do need different incentives. And I think in the discussion  
**[0:30:30-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:30:30):**  you were having with Dita, he was saying, for instance, we know sugar is bad. We know  that that's now been proven. And we know that sugar in the context of ultra-processed food  is even worse. We could start to tax to discourage people even more from consuming those kinds  
**[0:30:47-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:30:47):**  of foods. On the other hand, you know, the issue of meat and a meat tax is much more  complex and in fact, it would probably be a very bad idea because as he rightly pointed  out, it's not meat per se, it's how meat is produced. So we need to be taxing and incentivizing  
**[0:31:03-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:31:03):**  and subsidizing at the point at which that is being produced so that we're encouraging  people to produce the meat in the right way.  So when you look at the landscape, is that a landscape that's diverse, that's full of  
**[0:31:17-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:31:17):**  a range of different scales of farmers? Or is it a world where, you know, farms become  ever bigger and they're producing food perhaps ever more cheaply? I mean, I'm kind of wondering,  I suppose, you know, is there an extent to which all meat is equal in your worldview?  
**[0:31:34-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:31:34):**  You know, for example, a feedlots and concentrated animal feeding operations, CAFOs, are they  as valid as regenerative and agroecological production systems? Or do we need to transition  from one to the other?  
**[0:31:45-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:31:45):**  I think we do need to transition from the industrial model to almost 100% agroecology  model. That will take some time. But I'd like to also answer that question from a couple  of perspectives. From the perspective of animal welfare and ecological health, there's no  
**[0:32:03-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:32:03):**  question that we need to be disassembling the industrial food structure and moving towards  an agroecology model. From the perspective of human health and food equity, it's a little  bit more complicated, because we both know that there are benefits to eating regeneratively  
**[0:32:21-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:32:21):**  produced meat, for instance. And we know that there are benefits both to health and the  environment. There's some very interesting work going on about just how much more healthful  it is that that kind of meat. At the same time, we know that there are people on low  
**[0:32:35-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:32:35):**  incomes who just need access to protein, good quality protein of any kind, and should not  be penalized because they can't pay 25 pounds for a free range organic non soy fed chicken,  or for 10 pounds for a pack of regeneratively produced minced beef. So we need to be very  
**[0:32:59-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:32:59):**  conscious of bringing those people along. And this is where I think that the incentives  and the subsidies need to kick in to help producers to produce that at a lower cost,  and to help consumers have access to it. But it's not going to happen overnight. And I  
**[0:33:14-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:33:14):**  don't think we should be penalizing or judging people who go and buy the cheapest meat that  they can to feed their children.  It's interesting. When I go to parliamentary committees, one of the questions that I always  
**[0:33:27-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:33:27):**  get asked is, you know, all this good food is all very well, but actually we also need  cheap food. What about the poor people? What about the fact that there's a cost of living  in a crisis? Is it so important that we get cheap meat to people? Or is it about helping  
**[0:33:44-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:33:44):**  people to eat a much more nutritious and diverse diet themselves, rather than overemphasizing  the amount of protein they're trying to get into their system?  I think the only people you'll find who are saying we eat too much protein and we're exaggerating  
**[0:33:57-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:33:57):**  the importance of protein are people who are plant based advocates for their ilk. I don't  think you'll find a protein specialist in the science community who would say that.  Most people who specialize in this believe that the averages for the RDA is, you know,  
**[0:34:16-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:34:16):**  the 0.8 grams of protein per kilo of body weight, which is a minimum. And a lot of them  would like to see it up to 1 or 1.2, particularly for certain groups of people. So I think it's  a misnomer that we're getting too much protein or that we talk too much about protein. Protein  
**[0:34:31-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:34:31):**  is incredibly important and it's also incredibly misunderstood. There is a fallacy, which is  that we can just get protein from anywhere and we can get cheap protein, which doesn't  have to be from meat. It can be from lentils and rice and things like that, beans. But  
**[0:34:47-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:34:47):**  there is a reality here, which is, let's say you wanted to get your protein from 4 ounces  of British steak. Okay. You could get half of your minimum daily requirement, about 25  grams, and you could get that at a very low calorie cost, but probably about 1.8 to 2  
**[0:35:04-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:35:04):**  grams of carbon if we're factoring in also the carb and the environmental factor. Okay.  To get the same amount of protein from rice, you'd have to eat a kilo. That would have  a carbon cost, by the way, of 4 grams. So this is where it's really unfair just to compare  
**[0:35:20-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:35:20):**  foods if you're not talking about the protein element in the foods. So it's a misnomer to  think that we're going to help human health or environmental health by insisting that  we eat plant proteins, things like beans and rice. The other thing to note about the protein  
**[0:35:35-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:35:35):**  and the rice is it's not complete and it's not as bioavailable. So you're getting, you'd  have to even eat more than the kilo to get the whole thing. And you'd have to eat it  with some beans alongside in order to get the full amino acid profile. Protein is incredibly  
**[0:35:49-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:35:49):**  important. It is not easy to get it all from plants. And I think the suffering from a lack  of protein comes gradually. And I know that, um, Stephane Van Vliet has said, sometimes  you may not notice a lack of protein for five or 10 years, and then your systems start to  
**[0:36:05-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:36:05):**  break down and your bone health starts to break down and your immune system doesn't  function properly. So if you've been vegan or avoiding meat for a couple of years or  even five years, you might think you feel great, but you don't know what's coming down  
**[0:36:17-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:36:17):**  the line in terms of health. And I think we really need to counter this argument that  says that plant proteins are just as good as animal source protein.  Let me ask you two questions about that. And the first is, uh, you know, where I was sort  
**[0:36:30-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:36:30):**  of driving at with people eating, you know, perhaps too much protein, overemphasising  that need is, you know, people who are eating meat three times a day with every meal they're  eating meat. Um, and, and then you've got the sort of the other end of the, you know,  
**[0:36:44-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:36:44):**  the meat eating spectrum, I suppose where Compassionate World Farming will talk about,  you know, shifting diets. So you're eating meat two or three times a week. And I wonder  firstly, where you fit on that spectrum. And then secondly, do you think it's ever possible  
**[0:36:57-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:36:57):**  to be healthy and vegan? Ah, where do I fit on the spectrum in terms  of my personal consumption? Uh, I'm a two to three times a week person anyway. Uh, but  I will have, so that's my meat consumption, but then I will have eggs and cheese. So I'm  
**[0:37:11-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:37:11):**  getting some animal source protein every day. So I believe that's really important. And  I believe everybody should have the chance to do that. The second question, I think it  is possible to be healthy on a vegan diet with a couple of caveats. I think that it  
**[0:37:28-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:37:28):**  depends on your genetics and how well you can metabolize certain ingredients. So for  example, vitamin A from plants is a different form to the, the, the converted vitamin A  that we need in our bodies. Not everybody, in fact, a large proportion, some 50% of the  
**[0:37:46-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:37:46):**  population cannot make that transition. So if you're one of those people and you're getting  all of your vitamin A from plants, you're going to suffer. There's also, people have  a very different enzyme makeup in their guts, which allows them to process carbohydrates  
**[0:38:02-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:38:02):**  well or not. So some people will be able to eat the vast quantities of beans and rice  that you need to get your protein on a vegan diet and not suffer. Others will not. And  that's why one of the biggest complaints of people on a vegan diet is gastrointestinal  
**[0:38:16-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:38:16):**  distress and that's sometimes why they give it up. There are a whole range of these different  genetic differences, which will predispose someone to do well or not do well on a vegan  diet. I will also say that if you are on a vegan diet, you will have to pay very close  
**[0:38:32-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:38:32):**  attention to supplementation because there are many, many nutrients which are not available  and or not available in the right form on a plant-based diet. So I'm thinking B12 in  particular, so you really have to watch out for that. But also bioavailable versions of  
**[0:38:48-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:38:48):**  things like vitamin A, DHA, EPA, zinc and iron, they're much more bioavailable when  they come from animal food sources than from plant sources. So somebody who wants and is  dedicated to being vegan needs to really do their research and really listen to their  
**[0:39:07-0:39:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:39:07):**  own body. Are they one of these people that can do well and thrive or are they one of  the many who have to give it up for health reasons?  That kind of goes back to the global averages conversation we were having before. That there's  
**[0:39:21-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:39:21):**  an assumption that anybody can do well on any diet is false and that we all need to  listen to our bodies. And that whole sort of point about the bioavailability I think  is critical and certainly it's something that a lot of the people that I've known who are  
**[0:39:36-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:39:36):**  vegetarian and vegan who are taking supplements assume that the supplements are actually just  as good as getting them from the food directly and of course that's not the case. Now I wonder  in a world where we need greater nutritional diversity and a reduced land footprint in  
**[0:39:52-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:39:52):**  terms of meat and dairy production and in particular there I'm thinking about land that's  used to produce food for animals that are then raised and slaughtered and particularly  where that's deforestation, rainforest that's been taken away for arable production. We  
**[0:40:06-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:40:06):**  need dietary diversity and this can play a critical role. Now you've said before that  you don't have any particular problem with people choosing to be vegan or vegetarian  but you do clearly have a problem with vegan food and in particular vegan processed food  
**[0:40:21-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:40:21):**  and I wonder what that problem is. Why do you have that problem?  Well vegan processed food is just like all processed food, ultra processed food. So we  know that a large part of our diet is made up of that. We know that that's not good for  
**[0:40:36-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:40:36):**  health. We know that it's obesogenic and it's been proven in studies, they're very interesting  studies that show that if you feed someone a whole food diet versus a processed food  diet they eat 500 calories more a day if they're eating the processed food. There's something  
**[0:40:50-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:40:50):**  about it which is addictive and it has a lot of omega-6 in it generally which is also addictive.  So that's processed food in general and what I see happening is that the whole vegan revolution  is really being driven by corporations who are producing vegan versions of this processed  
**[0:41:09-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:41:09):**  food and by definition it's going to be even more processed with even more fake ingredients  because they're not able to put the eggs and the dairy and the meat in there. They have  to make something else to fill the gap which is why a vegan cheese does not even resemble  
**[0:41:24-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:41:24):**  cheese in any way. It's oils, it's a bunch of oils with some salt basically and other  additives which make it look like cheese. So my concern about the vegan food is really  about it pushing us even further in the direction of processed food consumption away from real  
**[0:41:41-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:41:41):**  food and that can't have anything but detrimental effect. The other thing we should note and  we should be wary of is taking the health claims of the vegan processed foods at face  value. A lot of claims are made that eating plant-based processed food has got to be better  
**[0:41:59-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:41:59):**  than eating meat or eating the meat version of whatever dish you're talking about. Recently  a study was done in the Journal of Nutritional Science that showed that there were absolutely  no health benefits at all from eating the plant-based version of say a burger versus  
**[0:42:17-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:42:17):**  the real thing. So those health claims which are used to persuade customers that there's  good reason to eat their product are not really based on science. So customers need to be  aware, consumers need to be aware and a little bit sceptical about what they're believing  
**[0:42:34-0:42:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:42:34):**  from this company. It's marketing, it's marketing.  That's precisely the word I was coming to. That it's partly about wanting to make more  money I guess which is why these claims are being made and it is essentially marketing  
**[0:42:48-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:42:48):**  because when you have food which is processed or ultra-processed, that is owned by somebody.  The patents, the ingredients etc, the recipes are owned by corporations which means that  there is this increasing centralisation of money in food which then draws money away  
**[0:43:06-0:43:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:43:06):**  from the countryside and away from individual farmers and rural economies.  Yeah, that's exactly right and those companies which are controlling, which would then control  the food system, control it partly through these patents as you say that patented technologies  
**[0:43:22-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:43:22):**  and that is going to drive us away from the decentralised democratic community-based food  system. It's going to drive us to a very centralised food system. I'm 100% convinced that that  is not going to do us any good in terms of either what we can do for the environment  
**[0:43:39-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:43:39):**  or what we can do for our health. The other thing that people don't realise, particularly  when we're talking about that radical cell-based meat solution to food is that it will require  an infrastructure like we've never seen before. You know, the size of the bioreactors, the  
**[0:43:58-0:44:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:43:58):**  number of bioreactors you have to have, the size of the factories, the sterile conditions  that have to be maintained within these factories to manage this complex process of creating  a protein out of nothing really.  
**[0:44:12-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:44:12):**  As you talk Jane, I'm struck again by the importance of a holistic perspective on food.  Absolutely and in fact this harks back to something again that Dieter Helm was saying.  He was talking about the fact that agriculture produces very little GDP but a lot of, relatively  
**[0:44:32-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:44:32):**  speaking, a lot of environmental impact, including land. But I was listening to that and thinking  what's wrong with this perspective? I think what I don't like about that perspective is  that GDP is such a reductionist view of what the value of something is and one of the reasons  
**[0:44:48-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:44:48):**  farming has a low GDP is because we undervalue it. We don't pay farmers what they should  be getting for the food that we're eating. And I also think the GDP doesn't take into  account any of those factors you're talking about. Community values, health. So those  
**[0:45:05-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:45:05):**  things really, in that sense, agriculture is at a disadvantage because of the way we  account for the value of sectors in our economy.  Jane, I want to ask you one more question before we go because time is moving on and  
**[0:45:20-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:45:20):**  I just want to go back to the title of the book that we've been talking about, The Great  Plant-Based Con, and thinking more about that word con. Now this implies that there has  been a concerted effort to confuse and mislead people into believing that plant-based products  
**[0:45:38-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:45:38):**  are better, perhaps nutritionally or environmentally, than animal products. Is that really what  you think and if so, who's behind this con ultimately as you see it?  Well, I do explain in the first chapter of my book because it's a really important question  
**[0:45:52-0:46:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:45:52):**  that you're raising. I explained that I don't think it's a concerted effort directed  by an individual or an organization. There's no puppet master here. There are lots of puppets,  as it were, acting according to their own self-interest. They each are motivated by  
**[0:46:10-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:46:10):**  different factors and it's the combined influence, the combined effect of all those  actors which creates this thing which appears like a con. So it creates this wall of information  and opinion which nobody can transgress. Some of those actors, for instance, we've already  
**[0:46:28-0:46:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:46:28):**  talked about them. So large corporations, they've got their eye on the prize. There's  a whole new opportunity to open up markets and make profits and they're going for it.  So of course they're going to attach messages which support that profit-seeking activity.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:46:44):**  It's just good marketing, as we've said. So they're doing their acting independently.  You then have agribusinesses, for instance, who will profit from a world in which there  is only artificial fertilizer. Of course they're going to support that kind of food system.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:46:59):**  You have non-governmental organizations and foundations like the Eat Lancet who seem to  thrive on the idea of controlling things, of one-size-fits-all diet. It's very neat  and tidy, isn't it? And they also benefit from the partnerships that they have with  
**[0:47:16-0:47:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:47:16):**  corporations. So there's a link there. We've talked about the motivations of the media  or the accidental harm that media does. When you add all those things together, throwing  in the not inconsiderable influence of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which a lot  
**[0:47:33-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:47:33):**  of people don't understand and know about, but they're very influential in forming food  policy and food guidelines, particularly in North America. So you throw all those things  in together and you have a pretty formidable force, which does look like a concerted effort  
**[0:47:49-0:48:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-great-plant-based-con-e1rqsm0#t=0:47:49):**  to persuade us in one direction.  Thanks so much. It's been so interesting talking to you.

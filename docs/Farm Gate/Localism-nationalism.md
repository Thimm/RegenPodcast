### Farm Gate  (2022-05-30)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Locus-Dane, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  of the Food and Global Security Network. A regenerative agricultural and environmental  transformation depends upon a resurgence of localism, of shortened supply chains and a  
**[0:00:20-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:00:20):**  better connection between farmers and citizens. But localism is championed not only by green  activists and middle-class enthusiasts for sustainable food, but by far-right politicians  who pronounce their own vision of localism centred on a tough approach to immigration.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:00:36):**  More than one in three people voted for Marine Le Pen in the French presidential elections.  Donald Trump narrowly lost a second term in the USA, and Brexit continues to shake the  very foundations of the United Kingdom. As the ecological crisis accelerates, food inequality  
**[0:00:52-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:00:52):**  and pressures on migration will only deepen. How can we safeguard food systems in a more  ecologically chaotic world with accelerating human migration? Can we find a popular but  inclusive vision of national localism? Can it become a force for good? And if so, what  
**[0:01:08-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:01:08):**  role does food play in helping to build and maintain a peaceful, stable and moral society?  I'm joined by Baroness Bennett of Manner Castle, otherwise known as Natalie Bennett of the  Green Party of England and Wales, and by Sue Pritchard, the chief executive of the Food,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:01:24):**  Farming and Countryside Commission. Welcome both.  Natalie, as we've seen in the recent French elections, the far-right views people's interest  in localism as an opportunity to decontaminate their brand, but stronger immigration control  
**[0:01:38-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:01:38):**  remains central to their message. Are immigration levels a threat to localism?  When this proposition was put to me, what I immediately thought of was the Scottish  independence referendum. And I was up there campaigning with the Scottish Greens. And  
**[0:01:52-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:01:52):**  what they were presenting very clearly and very popularly was a sense of civic nationalism,  a kind of, you know, in this context is a localism, an attachment to an area to, in  this case, a country that very much said the Afghan or Ukrainian refugee who arrived last  
**[0:02:10-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:02:10):**  week is as much as this as a part of our community, as is the person who's, you know, traces back  six generations and has a title or something. And so I think this is what happens in real  life. We've seen this in communities now, up and down the land, welcoming Ukrainian  
**[0:02:25-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:02:25):**  refugees as they welcomed Afghan and Syrian refugees before them. Communities open their  arms to newcomers, and that's part of their community identity. And there's absolutely  no reason why we can't see a foundation in localism. We have, like the far-right, been  
**[0:02:40-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:02:40):**  opposed to globalization. And this is something that my Greens, my part of politics goes back  a very long way. You think back to protests against globalization 20 years ago, which  very much came from my side of politics. You think about the fact that we've been campaigning  
**[0:02:53-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:02:53):**  against ISDS, investor state settlement procedures, which have just come to the forefront again.  This is something that very much is part of our politics. What we want to say is we have  a hopeful, inclusive, welcoming, caring kind of localism. And that's the localism I think  
**[0:03:10-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:03:10):**  people want.  As environmentalists, we frequently draw attention to the fact that resources are limited. And  now, as the cost of living rises and the quality of public services falls, with many people  
**[0:03:22-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:03:22):**  feeling their power and personal agency disintegrating, is it not reasonable for other people to draw  a parallel with what we've been saying ourselves and say, well, look, we just can't afford  more immigration. Public services are simply under too much pressure.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:03:36):**  Well, this is an argument that I've been having for the last decade or more. And I have a  very simple answer to this. And I found on the doorsteps, it works very well. Because  what we've had is two largest parties have been over that decade and more very happy  
**[0:03:51-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:03:51):**  to blame immigration for their own failures. If I ask people who say they're concerned  about immigration, what are they concerned about? The primarily the answers that you  get are crowded schools and hospitals, housings too expensive, my kids can't get a council  
**[0:04:05-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:04:05):**  bus, we can't get good jobs, there's not enough wages. All of those things are not the result  of immigration. Many immigrants come in, have been staffing our health service. Indeed,  you're far more likely to encounter an immigrant in the NHS helping you than they are in the  
**[0:04:18-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:04:18):**  queue with you. Many immigrants have built our homes. And so what we've seen is neoliberalism,  our political structures that's benefited the few, has seen 1% get richer and richer  and everyone else struggling for resources. And when you say that to people, they go,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:04:33):**  Oh, yeah, I can start to see that. But the problem is that it's been a real struggle  to get that narrative into the public domain, when you've got the two largest parties who  really essentially been bowing over a very long period of time to UKIP and then the Brexit  
**[0:04:46-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:04:46):**  Party.  So do you have thoughts on that, on this sort of resources issue?  I very much agree with Natalie on the points that she's just making there. This is about  
**[0:04:55-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:04:55):**  identity, and it's about culture. But it's about how those concepts have been weaponised  in service of particular purposes. If I look across France, you know, an equivalent country  in terms of size to the UK, there is a very, very strong commitment to local arrangements  
**[0:05:13-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:05:13):**  to strengthening local democracy, local food systems, local health care. So I think the  sorts of things that we're going to be talking about today almost exemplify the way that  populism takes complex issues, and tries to weaponise them with simple answers. And pretty  
**[0:05:34-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:05:34):**  much all we're going to talk about, I suspect, is going to be prefaced by it's complicated.  There are many other issues that we need to take into account when we pick off one or  two or three of these issues. And actually, I think being able to think in systems, whether  
**[0:05:50-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:05:50):**  they're local systems or big global systems, for me is the key to reframing how we talk  about localism to differentiate it from the populist version of localism that is doing  so much damage around the world at the moment.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:06:04):**  So that's all very well, but most people don't really spend a huge amount of time thinking  about politics. They require a simplicity, which is why populism is so successful and  why it works so well, perhaps, because it does distil really quite complex things into  
**[0:06:20-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:06:20):**  very simple messages, and often they're around blame. But surely there's a failure from our  side that we're not finding ways of simplifying the solutions that we want to represent.  Arguably, yes. You're right. Let me pick up your first point, which is a very reasonable  
**[0:06:37-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:06:37):**  pushback, Finn, though. People don't think in systems, but we live in systems. We live  intersectional lives. We navigate policy topics all of the time. We move from, if we're just  going to the doctors from where I live in the countryside, hopping on a bus to get to  
**[0:06:55-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:06:55):**  the doctors to do a quick shot and come home, I'm navigating transport policy, I'm navigating  health policy, I'm navigating development, huge range of policy areas in the way I live  my everyday life. And we all do. So we all live in systems, absolutely naturally. It's  
**[0:07:12-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:07:12):**  policy that makes it complicated. And it's when we try and shoehorn our lived experience  into policy conversations. People are very good at understanding the relationships between  different policy areas in their local lives. They're very good at identifying where the  
**[0:07:29-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:07:29):**  problems and the issues are. And they're often very good at identifying where the solutions  lie.  Mason, actually, how do you think we simplify some of these complex messages when we're  
**[0:07:38-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:07:38):**  trying to talk to people?  I think what we have to do is paint pictures and emotions of what the future looks like.  And I think the far right goes back to some rosy glasses, imaginary past. There's a real  
**[0:07:50-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:07:50):**  failure and I think there's a great deal of job work to be done is what does the countryside  look like when we have a universal basic income before they working week as standard? I always  say to when I'm speaking to creative people, artists, movie makers, etc. I don't want to  
**[0:08:03-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:08:03):**  see any more zombie movie movies or apocalypse novels. I want to see a Hollywood rom com  set out against you know, in a beautiful countryside, where boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy gets  boy again. And it's all worked out in 20 or 30 years time, we need to show people what  
**[0:08:17-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:08:17):**  it feels like focus on emotions focus on those pictures, rather than dry policy solutions,  which as Sue very rightly says, is very hard for people to relate to. I very much believe  that certainly in politics that hope is actually a far more productive emotion than fear. And  
**[0:08:32-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:08:32):**  hope is the emotion of what I would say is very, very broadly defined our side of politics.  Whereas fear, you know, we've got to build walls to keep those terrible others out is  the very basis of the kind of politics that we're talking about today.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:08:44):**  Let's go into one of those narratives, Sue, and there's been ample research to show that  Britain can still feed itself. And in fact, it can feed itself better following a transition  to agroecology. We're currently at 67 million people. How many more can Britain feed?  
**[0:08:58-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:08:58):**  At the moment, Britain is wasting something like six and a half million tonnes worth of  food that's good to eat. Now that actually adds up to 200 meals for every man, woman  and child in the country every year. So the questions perhaps are not about how many more  
**[0:09:21-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:09:21):**  can we feed? But how many more should we be feeding from the food that we already have  available? Because at the moment, we know that far too many people in the UK right now  are struggling to feed themselves. They're making really difficult decisions about whether  
**[0:09:38-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:09:38):**  to keep their cookers on or turn their cookers on and keep their fridges on, I'm hearing  in some cases. So the question of how many more people could we feed perhaps needs to  be unpacked a little bit more carefully. The first thing I think it's important to say  
**[0:09:53-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:09:53):**  is that a transition to agroecology will feed the UK population healthy, nutritious, sustainably  produced food with more horticulture, more well produced fruit, veg, nuts and pulses  and from ruminants grazing across the grass and farmed landscape. And that's without synthetic  
**[0:10:15-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:10:15):**  fertilisers without pesticides, and minimising hugely the nutrient loss. For all of those  things, we need to think about the conditions that would have to be created for that to  be really effective. And the waste stats I gave you at the start are pretty critical  
**[0:10:30-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:10:30):**  to that. So we absolutely do have to think about how we transform what is currently a  commodified, consolidated, financialised global food system where fewer and fewer products  are being produced by fewer and fewer companies. And those companies are all trying to get  
**[0:10:49-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:10:49):**  a piece out of the food pie whilst primary producers and citizens are taking all the  risks. Thanks Sue. Natalie, you wanted to come in.  Yes, just to say that I might even add to Sue's food waste figure and about a third  
**[0:11:03-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:11:03):**  of our arable land is going to feed food for animals. Now some of that is necessary, of  course, you know, over winter feed, etc. But a significant part of it is actually going  into factory farming, particularly of chickens and pigs. I said I've just been in Herefordshire,  
**[0:11:16-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:11:16):**  our rivers are in an absolutely dreadful state. And that's a major contributor to that. It's  also a huge issue in terms of antimicrobial resistance, something I'm planning to work  on a great deal more in the next coming parliament. Feeding perfectly good food to animals to  
**[0:11:30-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:11:30):**  produce much less food is food waste. And if we add that food waste figure in, that's  absolutely crucial. And what we have as a government that's heading in the wrong direction  just as we talk, they've postponed the planned very limited rules on buy one, get one free  
**[0:11:45-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:11:45):**  from junk food, we don't have a government that's saying how can we really help people  eat more fresh fruit and vegetables, which could support local growers, all those steps  onwards, we need to see those kind of positive policies. And if we, you know, going back  
**[0:11:58-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:11:58):**  to the question of numbers, we could have a third less people in the UK, and we still  wouldn't be self sufficient in food. But that's because of the nature of our food system,  not because we can't actually feed those people.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:12:08):**  So I just want to come back to this idea of national or foreign, of inside or outside.  And when the Food Farming and Countryside Commission promotes food system localism alongside  measures to protect British producers from lower quality food imports, so that the standards  
**[0:12:25-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:12:25):**  at home are protected, do you think there's a danger of mixing messages and somehow reinforcing  the idea that foreign is bad?  I mean, that is a real risk. And that's not the position that we take at all. I think  
**[0:12:38-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:12:38):**  the position that we take builds on the work that we do with partners such as the Food  and Land Use Coalition, who are working with farmers and farm groups in countries in other  parts of the world, often developing countries who are having to think extremely hard of  
**[0:12:53-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:12:53):**  their own transition to a form of agriculture that feeds their own communities much better,  but also deals with an incredibly pressing climate crisis that they're facing right now  already. We say that in the UK, we need to take more responsibility for growing more  
**[0:13:12-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:13:12):**  of the food that we are ecologically suited to grow. And we need to be raising standards  progressively, the environmental standards and the health standards of the food we grow,  because that is the right thing to do. And we should be trading in progressive and fair  
**[0:13:29-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:13:29):**  relationships with other countries around the world who are also growing the sorts of  foods that they are ecologically best suited to grow. Trade is valuable, where we depart  very dramatically from the globalisation agenda is when whole countries become monocultures  
**[0:13:47-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:13:47):**  in service of an industrialised agriculture system. So all they're growing is food for  export to the affluent North, and they're struggling to grow sufficient, healthy food  for their own communities, whilst also seeing a massive clearance of land from small and  
**[0:14:04-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:14:04):**  medium sized farming enterprises. And I think what this means ultimately is that we in the  global North have to take much more responsibility for dramatically reducing our own consumption  of the world's resources, whilst supporting the developing world to get to a place where  
**[0:14:20-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:14:20):**  they can meet their own basic needs with dignity.  Jason Vale,  So what you're talking about there is really combining a vision of localism with a vision  
**[0:14:28-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:14:28):**  for progressive internationalism as well. But at the same time, I just want to come  back on that idea that, you know, the FFCC, along with many organisations, is wanting  to maintain high British standards and make sure that imports meet those standards. And  
**[0:14:43-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:14:43):**  there is a protectionist element about that, surely.  Joanna  I don't know if it's necessarily protectionist. It can risk that. I mean, granted, I think  
**[0:14:52-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:14:52):**  there are some versions of that narrative that can get very, very close to a kind of  slightly unedifying nationalism. But in my experience, farmers in the global South, in  developing countries, want to produce food safely. They know fundamentally that they  
**[0:15:11-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:15:11):**  are deeply dependent on an environment, on an ecosystem that supports that farming. They  get driven into versions of farming that is extractive and that depletes their own environment.  So it's not that people in the global South want anything different. It's just that  
**[0:15:28-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:15:28):**  global agriculture has made it really difficult for them to achieve that. So I don't think  it is an either or at all. I think it is a both and.  David Pembroke  
**[0:15:37-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:15:37):**  And really, it's the target for maintaining those high standards and trying to stop imports  from lower standards isn't about trying to stop food imports from the global South,  is it? It's about trying to stop imports from richer nations that have invested heavily  
**[0:15:52-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:15:52):**  in these industrialised systems that are so extractive, which is allowing them to produce  food more cheaply, that we're then sort of railing against and trying to avoid having  into our own system because it undermines our own farmers' ability to deliver much  
**[0:16:07-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:16:07):**  more ecologically sound agriculture.  Natalie, I just wonder if we could sort of go back to this idea around communicating  ideas. It's much easier to blame other people for the problems that we face than it is to  
**[0:16:20-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:16:20):**  accept and take ownership and find solutions to them. And I know that both you and Sue  are very good at finding these solutions, but a lot of political parties seem to find  it very difficult to articulate them. So aren't populist parties always going to find it easier  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:16:36):**  to win?  Sue  I don't think that's true at all. I think there has been a period of a time where far  
**[0:16:42-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:16:42):**  right parties have been very successful. And perhaps controversially, I'll say that I think  we have a far right government in the UK. But we've just seen the recent local elections,  which I have to note that the Green Party did spectacularly well. And that's very much  
**[0:16:56-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:16:56):**  a politics that's founded in the local and it's a local that ranges everywhere from North  Yorkshire right down to the city of Bristol to two very different places. So it is possible  to tell these really good and different diverse stories. But I think to pick up a couple of  
**[0:17:10-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:17:10):**  points about what Sue was saying, I really want to pick up on the issue of industrial  lab produced food. And there's behind this is a fundamental understanding that somehow  humans can be more efficient than nature, that we can embed processes that, you know,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:17:26):**  actually use resources better than nature does. And many years ago, I should have one  of the cops, I heard the Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna talking about,  they were talking about the African savannah, about how it was 100 times more productive  
**[0:17:38-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:17:38):**  than the farmland that replaced it. And if we think about, you know, the feelings again,  what we're known as swaps, they were far more productive than the agricultural land we have  now, if you think about actual biological productivity. So what we have to do in places  
**[0:17:50-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:17:50):**  like Wakeland's agroforestry, for example, do this very well, really, you know, in harnessing  the productivity of nature, and that's going to be far, far better than anything we're  going to do by creating this really simplified artificial system. And it also just on the  
**[0:18:06-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:18:06):**  international trade, you know, there's another way of looking at this, particularly given  our current global situation and food security, should we really be taking food out of other  people's mouths. And the practical reality of that, I've only lived in Thailand, we probably  
**[0:18:18-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:18:18):**  still do import large amounts of prawns from Thailand, what you saw was small farmers growing  food for local consumption, displaced for giant prawn farms, which salinated the land,  and you know, had to be discarded and left essentially as waste after a few years. And  
**[0:18:35-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:18:35):**  that was not good for the people of Thailand, it was good for a few people who made large  sums of money, but it's not a long term solution. And it's not something that's feeding people.  Certainly there's still a big debate, a big argument that's taking place around food systems  
**[0:18:47-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:18:47):**  and the type of food systems that we need to feed ourselves, to feed people globally,  and to deliver the environmental change that we need. And that argument is deep, it's continuing.  And in coming decades, if we don't find a positive way of sorting this out very, very  
**[0:19:04-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:19:04):**  rapidly, then the impact of the ecological crisis which is unfolding around us at the  same time as we're having this discussion, are likely to become ever deeper. What do  you expect to happen in terms of global migration in that situation? And why would that be?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:19:20):**  What are the main drivers of migration?  I would say that obviously, one of the big things we're facing is the climate emergency  and there will be a large amount of climate migration. People tend to think of climate  
**[0:19:31-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:19:31):**  migration, they think of some, you know, the sea has rushed in and have covered over a  huge amount of land, or there's been some giant cyclone or hurricane or something. But  actually, of course, drought year after year, worse and worse weather conditions, worse  
**[0:19:45-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:19:45):**  growing conditions, it can also be a much more subtle process. But I think we have to  really think about how this debate might change. One of the things you learn in politics is  it's always a challenge not to fight the last election and the next election. And so the  
**[0:19:57-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:19:57):**  debates that we're talking about now are the debates that have been had in the past, you  might say pre Brexit, but we're in a situation now where global birth rates are falling off  the cliff, the global population is ageing fast. And there have been significant parts  
**[0:20:10-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:20:10):**  of the world, Southeast Asia is one of them, where historically kings didn't go out and  conquer land. Kings went out and conquered people and kidnapped those entire people and  brought them back because they could never have enough people to actually meet, you know,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:20:24):**  to work their land to grow their kingdom. And we can already see this happening, say  with trained medical personnel. There's a global shortage of medical personnel, there's  a huge amount of poaching going on from left, right and centre. So I think we can imagine  
**[0:20:37-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:20:37):**  a world, we may very soon be in a world where rather than worrying about migration, societies  more and more, and we have seen cases of Germany's case in point, how do we attract people, we  really need people, we need people, you know, to continue our society.  
**[0:20:52-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:20:52):**  Thinking about the ecological crisis and the way that it's likely to unfold, the way in  which we're likely to see migration as a result, what role does food play?  Well, I think as is suddenly, I mean, I've been using the hashtag food security on Twitter  
**[0:21:07-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:21:07):**  for at least a decade. And suddenly, this has become a mainstream debate. One of the  things that's absolutely crucial, and I was interested in too, I was having a debate with  an economist journalist, who was saying that actually, yes, lots of people were talking  
**[0:21:18-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:21:18):**  to him about crop diversity as well. And they were very much mainstream kind of people,  more than 50% of human calories coming from just four crops around the world is incredibly  dangerous. So when we're thinking about in both the climate emergency, but even put that  
**[0:21:33-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:21:33):**  to one side, we desperately need to hugely diversify our crops for all of the health  reasons that Sue was talking about earlier in the UK context, but also very much for  security. And again, you know, to mention Wakelands, they work on on races, so they  
**[0:21:46-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:21:46):**  have diversity within a single field, in terms of you know, some wheat that's tall, some  wheat that's short, some wheat that does well with drought, some wheat does well with  when it's wet, you know, we need to think about rather than those monoculture, identical,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:21:59):**  endless fields, as Sue was saying much more vegetables and fruits, nuts, but also just  even where we do have wheat or America, I saw that India is is they're really starting  to talk about going back to millet, very traditional crop that's almost disappeared, but is actually  
**[0:22:15-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:22:15):**  much more drought hardy, and generally a much tougher crop. So there's so many things out  there. Hodmer dogs in the UK has done amazing job in recovering some some historically quite  large crops and bringing them back again. So all of this canon must be done.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:22:30):**  Food also has the enormous potential, I think, to be part of the solution, the solution in  which people, as we were talking about, right at the start of this can imagine together  the kind of future they want to live in. So the work that we've been doing with the poorest  
**[0:22:44-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:22:44):**  communities around the UK in partnership with local trust, the big local communities, 150  of the poorest communities, we have noted how food and sharing food responding to food  crises to people's experiences of hunger and hardship and poverty, how food becomes the  
**[0:23:04-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:23:04):**  root out of those crises to a more supportive and more connected, a more convivial and a  healthy community where people are yes, stopping food banks and making sure that people have  the food that they need, but also creating community kitchens, teaching cooking skills,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:23:23):**  teaching people how to use the kinds of ingredients that they can get more of, bringing people  together out of loneliness and isolation to sit together over food in a dignified, kind,  thoughtful way, because it's within the community, it's people in the community supporting other  
**[0:23:40-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:23:40):**  people in their communities. So at the same time, as we start talking and urgently about  the big structural and global issues that we need to work on, at the same time, I think  it's really important that we amplify those stories of people working in their communities  
**[0:23:58-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:23:58):**  with food at the heart of those actions, but which also deal with many of the other issues  that we need to deal with, like loneliness, like isolation, like health and wellbeing  and like, you know, good work, good, productive, caring, thoughtful work in communities.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:24:13):**  I agree with almost everything that Sue just said. What I'll disagree with at the start  is about the continuations of food banks. I believe that we shouldn't rest until the  last food bank closes because of lack of demand.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:24:24):**  Oh, I completely agree. I completely agree with that. But for right now, for right now,  they are keeping very many people, far, far too many people away from starvation.  Is this challenge, isn't it, of dealing with an emergency that is unfolding in real time  
**[0:24:42-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:24:42):**  in front of us and an emergency which is taking place slightly more invisibly, which is taking  place over a slightly longer period? And that kind of brings us back, Sue, to this question  around global systems and global solutions. And, you know, I'm sure that we share the  
**[0:24:58-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:24:58):**  fear that climate change coupled with continuing biodiversity loss is going to lead to ever-rising  food insecurity around the world. And I wonder how it is that we can make food systems, what  are the fundamentals to make food systems themselves more resilient?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:25:13):**  So I think we've touched on lots of those issues already today. I think relocalising  where it's appropriate to do so and within the safe ecological boundaries of places is  absolutely central to that. It does a number of things. It takes more responsibility for  
**[0:25:30-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:25:30):**  growing what we can close to our communities. It reduces food miles. It gets fresh, local,  seasonal food onto people's plates. It changes people's relationship with food. So people  remember where their food comes from and what healthy, nutritious, sustainably produced  
**[0:25:46-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:25:46):**  food actually looks and feels like. So that's a critically important component of a more  sustainable future. But I think the other big issue that we absolutely have to start  facing into now is that we have to bring much more pressure on global food businesses to  
**[0:26:03-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:26:03):**  take a long, hard look at their business models and make rapid change. And that means disinvesting  in some of the very things that have been incredibly profitable for them for years.  This is akin for me to the sorts of activism that we saw around tobacco and around oil  
**[0:26:22-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:26:22):**  and fossil fuels. There are some global food businesses whose core business models are  producing far too much of the stuff that is just harmful to people and to planet. And  if they were stopped tomorrow, they would have a net beneficial effect on all of our  
**[0:26:40-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:26:40):**  health and wellbeing. I want to see, first of all, much more shareholder and stakeholder  activism around food businesses and global agri-food businesses. And we really need to  draw attention, focus our attention on those global institutions that try to broker international  
**[0:27:00-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:27:00):**  conversations to really focus on the impact of an industrialised, intensive, global agri-food  system on health, wellbeing, on climate and on nature.  I'm going to come back to business in just a moment, Sue, but I'm kind of, I'm thinking  
**[0:27:17-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:27:17):**  about soil and the role that it plays. And it seems to me, if we're thinking about global  drivers, that the regeneration of soil, the prioritisation of soil health, reversing aridification  around the world, getting soil functioning, that that single objective of restoring soil  
**[0:27:38-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:27:38):**  health ought to be prioritised right up there alongside reducing CO2 emissions. And we hardly  ever hear about it from the global community. The science of soil is really, really underdeveloped.  We talk about evidence-based science, evidence-based practice, but we can only have evidence if  
**[0:27:56-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:27:56):**  we've been asking the right questions and done the right research to discover the evidence  that we need to make those sorts of critical decisions. And soil science is relatively  new, but it is revealing so much. And I absolutely agree with you, Finn, though, that paying  
**[0:28:13-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:28:13):**  much more attention to those really critical activities that build soil organic matter,  that allow the extraordinary life that exists below the ground to flourish. It's just essential.  Mason. And we don't necessarily need to wait for academia to come up with every answer  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:28:31):**  to every question.  Briony. We know enough.  Mason. We know a lot. And there's so much anecdotal evidence, particularly from indigenous  
**[0:28:37-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:28:37):**  communities and regenerative farmers, agroecological farmers that are trying to bring learnings  from those indigenous communities into the way that they're farming as well in the Western  world.  
**[0:28:49-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:28:49):**  Briony. Yeah. And I suppose I get a little bit grumpy because I sit on some academic  advisory boards and cause lots and lots and lots of requests for large sums of public  money for research comes from institutions who are really interested in the novel and  
**[0:29:04-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:29:04):**  the new and who are looking at the next commercialised invention in food systems. And I think you're  right to say that actually a lot of what we need to do much more of in food and farming  systems is to do less and to support and replenish the absolute foundations of nature that Natalie  
**[0:29:23-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:29:23):**  talked about right at the start of this, that nature does know how to sustain life and has  done incredibly well for millions of years. And it's our depressingly narcissistic idea  that we somehow know better on some really critical issues that's getting us into this  
**[0:29:41-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:29:41):**  mess.  Mason. I want to go back to responsibility. In many parts of the developing world, there  seem to be two predominant food production narratives. One still centred on subsistence  
**[0:29:52-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:29:52):**  agriculture, something which is much more akin to agroecology and production for local  properties. And the other seems to be a race for embracing global markets to follow some  of the most extractive forms of Western agribusiness. I wonder how British policy, both political  
**[0:30:08-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:30:08):**  and corporate, is influencing food systems in developing nations.  I'm afraid at the moment, overwhelmingly British policy is directed in entirely the wrong direction  towards that giant agribusiness model. And indeed, we've just seen a new announcement  
**[0:30:22-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:30:22):**  of the aid policy, our significantly depleted aid budget when the government broke its manifesto  commitment to 0.7% of GNP going to age down to 0.5. And now we're having this heavy redirection  towards aid for trade supporting British businesses, which will often be multinational businesses.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:30:40):**  So I think our policies are headed in entirely the wrong direction. And that was also true,  as Sue was saying, the government talks a great deal about innovation. And I'll be spending  quite a bit of my coming time on the genetic modification brackets precision breeding bill,  
**[0:30:55-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:30:55):**  utterly misnamed. The government occasionally pays lip service to agroecology and soils.  And you know, what we saw was in the environment bill now act. I'm very proud of the fact that  the first vote the Greens ever won in either house of parliament was actually to insert  
**[0:31:09-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:31:09):**  soils as a priority area in that act. We lost it down in the other places we call the commons.  But we did get some concessions from the government and saying they're going to do things on looking  after British soils. We're supposed to be seeing them roundabout now. We were promised  
**[0:31:22-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:31:22):**  in the spring. So we're very much looking out for that. But I don't think the government  really gets this at all. I think we've really got to recapture that word innovation. Innovation  means doing things differently doing things in new ways. And that means the old way was  
**[0:31:37-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:31:37):**  the industrial monoculture. The new way is agroecology. And we've got to not just say,  Oh, we're leaving it, I think I would put it differently to Sue here, we're not leaving  it to nature. What we're actually doing is finding new ways to work with nature, we're  
**[0:31:50-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:31:50):**  innovating enormously, we're using human knowledge and skills, which needs to be greatly developed  and encouraged to very much look after our soils, look after our wildlife, and above  all look after ourselves because you ask what do we do to change this around, we have huge  
**[0:32:06-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:32:06):**  externalized costs from our current food system. One of those experience, externalized costs  is extremely unhealthy societies, terribly poor public health. If we change this around,  and ensure that companies can't continue to do that, to essentially poison us with ultra-processed  
**[0:32:21-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:32:21):**  pap, we're all better off and we have a different model.  It seems to me, Sue, that actually that there is a really positive example of the sort of  thing that we're talking about when we look at the way that agroecology and regenerative  
**[0:32:32-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:32:32):**  agriculture have sort of taken over quite a lot of the consciousness within the conversation  around farming and smallholders in the UK in particular in the last five years or so.  And I've always sort of been of the view that technology and information around technology  
**[0:32:48-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:32:48):**  is self disseminating because the companies that invest in technology, whether that's  GM or a tractor, invest then in advertising it. Whereas knowledge, it's much harder to  share knowledge because there isn't a profit necessarily associated with it. But social  
**[0:33:03-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:33:03):**  media has allowed us to tell a positive story in a way that we haven't been able to perhaps  until now and to have many more people listening to that positive message. And we've seen some  really positive change as a result.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:33:15):**  You're absolutely right, Philo. And it's a real mission at FFCC to kind of amplify and  illuminate those wonderful stories of people getting on and doing things already of farmers,  particularly new entrant farmers, actually, who are as passionate about the broader issues  
**[0:33:31-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:33:31):**  beyond the farm gate as they are about developing their farming practices. So telling those  stories and providing support for the networks that are already forming. We're supporting  a new network in Northern Ireland right now, the growing network where farmers are working  
**[0:33:46-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:33:46):**  together to understand how they can transition their own businesses to more regenerative  practices more quickly. There are lots of others all around the country. Telling those  stories is a great encouragement to other farmers. Farmers tend to learn from farmers.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:34:02):**  They don't tend to be terribly interested in what policymakers have got to say. And  it's not getting any better. But they will learn a lot from other farmers and they will  learn on the farm gate. They want to be able to see how things work with a very kind of  
**[0:34:16-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:34:16):**  practical orientation. So telling those stories becomes really critical.  I guess where I get a little bit concerned right now is that for those businesses who  have been very reluctant to change, for those who have been really, really dragging their  
**[0:34:31-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:34:31):**  heels, some of the very real anxieties around food security and global food supplies right  now are giving them a real shot in the arm to carry on advocating for business as usual  for a little bit longer. We see that with fossil fuel sector and we're seeing it with  
**[0:34:50-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:34:50):**  industrial intensive agricultural systems, taking environmentally sensitive land back  into food production. And even in my local community, farmers now ploughing right up  to the hedge lines, whereas not so long ago they were leaving a good two metre strip.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:35:06):**  So I think there is pressure on to demonstrate how we can manage both food security and keep  our eye on the really critical issues in the climate nature crisis.  I'm really pleased that you've brought up that challenge around the way in which many  
**[0:35:22-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:35:22):**  farmers leaders have been responding to the current food price crisis. And let's think  about where that takes us at the end of that narrative. If we don't change, I mean, you  and I have discussed in the past our fears that we'll reach two degrees C well before  
**[0:35:37-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:35:37):**  2050. And if we're seeing that now, then that just simply brings us closer to that end.  So if people fail to regenerate soils and deliver widespread agroecology, if farmers  do what it's being suggested by the NFU that they do and just sort of up production, remove  
**[0:35:55-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:35:55):**  those field boundaries, take those hedges out, what does a two degree world look like  for agriculture and food security?  I mean, it's pretty terrifying, really. So, you know, a 1.5 degree world is bad enough.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:36:08):**  That is bad enough. So let's not pretend that somehow 1.5 degrees is a result. That is the  bare minimum that we need to be aiming for. But a two degree world will see sea levels  rising by 56 centimetres. That's half a metre sea level rises. Ten of the world's biggest  
**[0:36:26-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:36:26):**  cities are right on the coast. That's going to have massive implications for people in  those communities and for population movement. The oceans get hotter and the oceans stop  being able to absorb global heat that they're currently able to do. Coral reefs will be  
**[0:36:41-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:36:41):**  dying out dramatically. Heat waves will become the new norm. It will be really difficult  to plan for planting and harvesting in the way that we have perhaps taken for granted  for the last couple of hundred years. There will be a lot more rain, but not everywhere.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:36:57):**  So we'll see flash floods and storms, which just wipe out harvest to make it really difficult  to plant. We'll see animals and plants unable to occupy the niches that they currently exist  in with massive knock on effects to ecosystems. And it will just become much, much harder  
**[0:37:17-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:37:17):**  to grow the small number of staple crops that we've come to rely on. And it's why returning  to more localising food systems where we grow more of a much wider range of food that is  ecologically suited for those places and those conditions becomes really important. Crop  
**[0:37:37-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:37:37):**  trust is keeping an incredible repository of a whole range of things that we've grown  and eaten in the past that we just don't anymore. Rediscovering a much wider range of food that  we can grow in much more fragile ecosystems, much more precarious ecosystems is going to  
**[0:37:57-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:37:57):**  become absolutely critical pretty quickly.  Natalie, we've talked quite a lot already about the way in which we need to change things  in order to deliver that food resilience. And clearly that food resilience is important  
**[0:38:10-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:38:10):**  everywhere. But at the same time, it's unlikely that we're going to sort food systems out  quickly enough. And if we don't, there is going to be a significant increase in food  insecurity and in global migration. So let's go back to that question of migration. How  
**[0:38:25-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:38:25):**  should Britain and other richer nations prepare for this challenge of mass migration?  Well, first of all, sorry, I want to do that terribly politician-y thing and challenge  the terms of your question in that political change and indeed system change, I think we  
**[0:38:40-0:38:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:38:40):**  have a general societal view that it happens slowly and gradually, you know, you get a  5% change, then a 10% change, then a 15% change. Actually, political change and system change  can happen very suddenly in giant leaps. And if we look at the politics, the last significant  
**[0:38:55-0:39:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:38:55):**  change in British politics was the rise of Margaret Thatcher. If you look on a global  scale about the same time Ronald Reagan, neoliberalism has dominated our politics, globalisation  has dominated our economics and our systems over the past 35, 40 years, you've only got  
**[0:39:10-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:39:10):**  to read the Financial Times at all kinds of levels saying this is broken, that's broken,  gosh, this isn't working. And that, you know, you would see as the as the organ of the establishment  or the organ of the current system, but they can see that it's broken. And we also can  
**[0:39:23-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:39:23):**  look back to COVID and think about what happened back in that March, that first lockdown, we  had an emergency, and suddenly the way the whole world worked changed enormously. So  it is possible to make really significant change. But as Sue was saying, we're now at  
**[0:39:39-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:39:39):**  1.1, 1.2 degrees, the World Meteorological Organisation has warned that there's a high  risk 50% risk in the next five years that we'll have one year that goes to 1.5. It won't  be sticking at that point, but we could have one year at 1.5. We've got the Office of Environmental  
**[0:39:55-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:39:55):**  Protection here in the UK, the new body created by the Environment Act coming out and saying  that our natural world is at absolutely a risk of massive tipping points in terms of  biodiversity, in terms of fisheries in the oceans, they're clearly particularly worried  
**[0:40:09-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:40:09):**  about and in terms of soils. And so we can turn this around. But we will even if we do  do that turnaround, of course, as you rightly say, still see large amounts of migration,  migration, migration forced by ecological change and disaster. And the answer to that  
**[0:40:25-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:40:25):**  is we need a world in which those people are cared for and given appropriate places to  live. And I think we're going to see a world in which people those people are increasingly  welcomed as people with energy, skills and talents that we need. The practical reality  
**[0:40:41-0:40:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:40:41):**  of the world we're in now is we face enormous problems. To solve those problems, what we  need are the inputs, the energy, the ideas, the abilities of as many people as possible  able to contribute as much as possible to all of our societies.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:40:56):**  I hear what you say, Natalie, and I share, you know, a large amount of your analysis  there, certainly in terms of your ambition for the way that people will respond. But,  you know, even in the last decade, in particular, we've seen this rise in populism where people  
**[0:41:12-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:41:12):**  like Donald Trump have found it very easy to whip people up so that, you know, walls  are built again. And that's the big fear that I have that progressive narratives won't be  able to win through. And to an extent, the failure to recognise that people have genuine  
**[0:41:28-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:41:28):**  fears about immigration over the last three decades, and to find a popular progressive  response has arguably fed that rising tide of populism that people have been dismissed,  their fears have been sidelined rather than engaged with. We've been scared of this conversation.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:41:45):**  And if people feel they aren't being listened to, even though they support the basic tenets  of localism, then they want to put that wall up around it. So I'm wondering whether there  is a middle ground, whether we can establish a vision of national localism, which is a  
**[0:41:58-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:41:58):**  policy around migration that both liberals and social conservatives can both accept,  even if neither of us are actually particularly ecstatic about it.  Well, I think first of all, you say Trump built walls. Well, Trump built some disconnected,  
**[0:42:14-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:42:14):**  utterly illogical bits of walls.  I meant more emotional walls, mental walls.  Okay, well, nonetheless, the practical reality is Trump utterly failed in what his planned  
**[0:42:24-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:42:24):**  intentions were. And the world can change very fast. Just look at the huge number of  British people signing up saying they want to welcome Ukrainian refugees into their home.  That's not something that came very much from the grassroots up. It wasn't something created  
**[0:42:40-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:42:40):**  by any political party. I think I've looked to the Lord Harrington, the government minister  responsible in the eye and seen the terror in his eyes of how to make this all work.  You know, whether the government wants to make it work is another question. But there's  
**[0:42:52-0:43:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:42:52):**  no doubt at all that the public wants to welcome Ukrainian refugees. People can and do see  that people are victims of the climate emergency. Very often people through no fault of their  own have essentially contributed nothing to that emergency. And people will say, you know,  
**[0:43:07-0:43:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:43:07):**  we want to help, we want to care. And you know, we're also looking at a practical point  now where I was listening to debate in the house yesterday on the economy and hearing  particularly the people from across the chamber from me, the Tories and Crossbench are saying,  
**[0:43:22-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:43:22):**  this labor shortage, it's a real problem. You know, how are we going to tackle this  labor shortage and this skill shortage? What are we going to do about that? That shows  you just how much the narrative, the discussion has changed in a very short period of time.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:43:34):**  We're in a very different situation now to where we were 12 months ago.  We're coming towards the end of the program. And while I recognise that we've been talking  about some pretty dark stuff, I think we have to. And much as I'm hearing, you know, what  
**[0:43:48-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:43:48):**  you're saying there, and much as I can see that you as a leader within a political party  has a faith in politics and an optimistic view of how we can change the future. The  question is, is democracy itself as an institution able to cope with the enormous challenges  
**[0:44:07-0:44:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:44:07):**  that we face? Is it able to move quickly enough, deliver change that's deep enough? Or is it  now inevitable, perhaps that populism and misdirection, boosterism and the politics  of blame will rise simply because the challenges we face as a society are increasingly insurmountable?  
**[0:44:25-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:44:25):**  I absolutely disagree with that, starting with the assumption that what we have now  is democracy. The societies broadly that are doing the best around the world are the societies  where parliament reflects the will of the people, where you have strong local institutions,  
**[0:44:39-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:44:39):**  strong local authorities, you know, Scandinavians is the obvious case study. Boris Johnson has  100% of the power in the commons and effectively in the country, having won 44% of the votes,  about 30% of registered voters voted for him. We have power and resources unbelievably intensely  
**[0:44:56-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:44:56):**  concentrated in Westminster. We are the most concentrated polity in Europe in terms of  local government having very little power and very little resources, and it's been  eking each way all the time. So as I once did in debating the author of a book titled  
**[0:45:13-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:45:13):**  Against Democracy is before we give up on democracy, let's try some of it. So the answer  is to make the UK a democracy. I was in a stop the...  And what does that look like? What does that look like? What is democracy?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:45:25):**  Well democracy is a parliament that reflects the will of the people, resources and power  being held locally and only referred upwards when absolutely necessary. I was at a stop  the rot demonstration on Sunday and people are, you know, again and again calling for  
**[0:45:41-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:45:41):**  the facts that empowered citizens, you know, I was talking to school pupils on Monday saying  make politics what you do not have done to you. It's again that harnessing the talents,  the knowledge, the skills, the energy of huge numbers of people. Democracy means everyone  
**[0:45:58-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:45:58):**  having the chance to do politics, to have a power of decision making, you know, starting  with very young people and going right through our society.  But at the same time we have what we have and the conversation, you know, what you're  
**[0:46:12-0:46:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:46:12):**  proposing there is a conversation, it's a proposal which I've heard throughout my  life. People saying we don't have democracy in the UK, there isn't democracy in this,  that or the other country in the developed world. We need something else but we've not  
**[0:46:25-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:46:25):**  yet been able to deliver it and we are in this period of emergency. What needs to change  about the system that we have and how do we change it?  Well I think what's changed enormously in say the last 20 years is 20 years ago in the  
**[0:46:40-0:46:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:46:40):**  House of Lords where I sit regularly you'd get lots of people going, oh the wonderful  British Constitution, you know, it's the mother of parliaments and this is the example for  the world. I don't even hear the greatest traditionist saying that anymore. An acknowledgement  
**[0:46:56-0:47:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:46:56):**  that this is really not working is pretty well, you know, if you went out and did a  survey on the street about 100 people, is our politics broken, does our system not work,  you would get pretty well 100% agreement. So the first thing that has to happen is for  
**[0:47:10-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:47:10):**  there to be a genuine desire to change and I joined the Green Party in 2006 and back  then pre-financial crash, going around and telling a story of change, what we're doing  is now it's not working, we've got to change it, was really hard work. Whereas now there's  
**[0:47:26-0:47:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:47:26):**  a survey which has been done over many decades asking people do you think your kids and grandkids  will have a better life than you've had and that's increasingly, the negative figure on  that is getting steeper and steeper all of the time. So people get in their gut that  
**[0:47:40-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:47:40):**  what we're doing now, whether it's food, whether it's politics, whether it's economics, whether  it's our education system, is not working. And the good news is that where we are now  is profoundly unstable. The thing that will not happen is things will not continue as  
**[0:47:53-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:47:53):**  they are now and history is not pre-written. I can't tell you what will happen next because  no one knows, history is made by the actions of people. So it's offering people hope, showing  them those pictures of positive ways forward as Sue and the FFCC is doing beautifully when  
**[0:48:11-0:48:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:48:11):**  it comes to food and farming. Creating those pictures is the way in which we get them all  involved and engaged and we make the kind of history that we want for the future.  And it seems in the UK, much as the Conservative Party has been embroiled in crisis after crisis,  
**[0:48:27-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:48:27):**  almost as if they are trying to lose an election, they simply don't seem to be able to do it.  So is some kind of left and centre-left alliance inevitable and is it necessary?  I don't think an alliance making, you know, stitching everything up in Westminster more  
**[0:48:43-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:48:43):**  centralised power isn't necessarily the answer. I mean, what we actually have around the country  is we haven't sort of set it all yet since the recent local elections. But for those,  there were 16 places where Greens were in various forms of rainbow coalitions, different  
**[0:48:58-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:48:58):**  groups of local parties, sometimes local parties getting together and running councils. Herefordshire  is one of those places that's like that. And we're actually seeing a different model of  politics being built very much from the grassroots up. So it's happening at that kind of level.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:49:13):**  So I think what it is, is again, we come back to localism. Locals decisions will be made  in different places and voters will make those decisions. So we're moving forward to a different  kind of politics. And just because Labour and Tory have been the two largest parties  
**[0:49:26-0:49:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:49:26):**  for a century, doesn't necessarily mean that's going to continue.  So, if we're stuck with the democracy that we have, if we're stuck with the two party  system, and we don't find a way to change that, and fail to provide solutions, is it  
**[0:49:40-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:49:40):**  possible for society to opt out in some way? Because that seems to kind of be one of the  options that we've been tossing around here for communities and society more broadly to  sideline governments and just take collective control of their own future to deliver agroecology  
**[0:49:55-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:49:55):**  despite government, to create resilience despite increased pressure on national resources,  and establish a more inclusive society despite the fear and rage of the populists on the  far right.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:50:07):**  I shared Natalie's analysis. Democracy might be flawed, but the alternatives are very,  very much worse. And in the kind of stories we've been sharing today, there are lots of  examples where people in places are finding ways to collaborate, often across party political  
**[0:50:26-0:50:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:50:26):**  lines, to restore and regenerate their communities. And I think there are some prospects that  do transcend party political lines. It is a conservative notion to support freedom and  to devolve responsibility and accountability to communities and to trust people to be able  
**[0:50:49-0:51:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:50:49):**  to manage their lives by and large themselves. Now, that traditional conservatism has become  very much corrupted by a version of neoliberal politics that some countries are in hock to  at the moment. But that is a route through to a more collaborative and connected version  
**[0:51:10-0:51:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:51:10):**  of the future that actually speaks to people from all political traditions, devolving responsibility,  devolving agency, devolving power, devolving resources to those people in places who ultimately  will know best about what works for them and their communities and their lives with the  
**[0:51:32-0:51:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:51:32):**  right institutional support and arrangements around that.  The thing that we haven't talked about today, and I think is probably a whole other podcast,  is what's often called the fourth estate, the way that information is shared, how national  
**[0:51:49-0:52:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Localism--nationalism-e1j9176#t=0:51:49):**  stories are told through the media. We're still very dependent on our mainstream media  in the UK, what we read in the headlines of the most popular newspapers.

### Farm Gate  (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 10:01:08)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. Since 2017, the Food, Farming and  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:11):**  Countryside Commission has helped to shape the UK's conversation about food. Where  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:15):**  it comes from, how it's produced, how far it travels and where and how it gets sold  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:20):**  and eaten. The Commission has successfully brought different stakeholders out of their  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:24):**  individual silos and ensured that a creative and multi-disciplinary conversation has taken  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:29):**  place. One of the Commission's most important contributions is to have put both humans and  
**[0:00:34-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:34):**  the farmed landscape back into the food story, using a mixture of personal experiences, case  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:40):**  studies, poems, paintings interspersed among their excellent recommendations. They've  
**[0:00:45-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:45):**  helped to remind us that it's people, not companies, who produce food and manage farmland.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:51):**  And that it's people who buy and cook food and then eat and enjoy nutritious meals. They've  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:00:56):**  shown us that food is a dynamic force, constantly reshaping the landscapes we enjoy, not only  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:02):**  in the United Kingdom, but around the world. Today, we're here to discuss the Food, Farming  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:07):**  and Countryside Commission's Wales Inquiry Report, the Wales Field Guide for future generations.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:13):**  Sue Pritchard is the Chief Executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:17):**  Jane Davidson is the Chair of the Commission's Wales Inquiry. Jane is Pro Vice-Chancellor  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:22):**  Emeritus at the University of Wales, Trinity St David. And from 2007 to 2011, Jane was  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:28):**  the Welsh Government's Minister for Environment, Sustainability and Housing. Welcome both.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:34):**  Sue, let me start by coming to you. The Food, Farming and Countryside Commission has moved.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:40):**  You've left the RSA. You're struck out alone. What's changed?  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:43):**  Well, in fact, very little has changed. We were enormously grateful to Esme Fairbairn  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:49):**  Foundation for extending their trust and confidence in us for another three years to work up a  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:01:55):**  programme now of implementation. So the time that we spent at the RSA, two good years,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:02):**  were focused on inquiry, on investigation, on research and working with people and communities  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:07):**  around the UK, as you described so generously in your introduction. But now we have moved  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:12):**  on to think very hard about how we make change happen. How do we help implement those recommendations  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:17):**  for real, practical and pacy change on the ground? And for that, we wanted to be able  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:23):**  to focus absolutely relentlessly and wholeheartedly on our own core mission and purpose. And in  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:29):**  conversations with our stakeholders and with our funders, they were very keen to see us  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:33):**  set up as an independent charitable organisation, able to focus on our own work. But that being  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:39):**  said, all of the commissioners have come with us, all of the team has come with us. So we're  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:44):**  exactly the same organisation as we were at the RSA. We just now have the capacity to  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:51):**  shape and direct our own future.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:53):**  And there are some new faces because we have the Welsh report and of course Jane is here  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:02:57):**  as your chair. And I just wonder, you know, the Wales inquiry is seeking to build on the  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:02):**  previous work that you've done. But what is it particularly that the Wales report aims  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:07):**  to achieve?  
**[0:03:08-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:08):**  The Wales report tells a very particular story of the unique policy and legal framework that  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:17):**  Wales has developed over the last 10 years, really since, since devolution, of which Jane  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:22):**  was one of the absolute key architects, particularly the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, Environment  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:28):**  Act Two. And it tells how that particular framework shapes the possibility in Wales  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:33):**  for really radical and interesting work to happen. Now, for the last couple of years,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:38):**  we focused, as we've done around the country, actually, on some very particular questions  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:43):**  in our county and our country inquiries. In Wales, we looked very hard at the role of  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:48):**  public procurement and how public keystone institutions can use their buying power to  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:03:54):**  help reshape a fairer, more sustainable food system for the country. And that generated  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:00):**  some really interesting conclusions which have already been picked up by the parts of  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:05):**  the country. Now we're going to be picking up issues of land use, of a just and sustainable  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:10):**  food system, what that means for affordable, healthy, nutritious food for all, and the  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:16):**  extent to which the particular public institutions in Wales can play a much stronger leadership  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:22):**  role in bringing about change and making change happen.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:25):**  So you mentioned there the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act, and I'd like to get into,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:30):**  you know, what devolution means and how the Welsh government's approach differs from  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:34):**  Westminster, from I suppose what we call the English government's approach these days.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:39):**  But first of all, Jane, can you tell me a bit about the Wellbeing of Future Generations  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:42):**  Act? Because I think people outside Wales won't necessarily know that it exists. What  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:46):**  is it? Where did it come from? What does it do?  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:49):**  You're absolutely right, Finlow, to think that there are people outside Wales who don't  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:53):**  know it exists. And I think there'll probably be a number of people in Wales who still don't  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:04:57):**  know it exists either. But very briefly, the Act actually came about because when the National  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:04):**  Assembly for Wales started in 1999, the commissioners in the UK government were influenced by civil  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:11):**  society in Wales, which was asking for the new institution, the new National Assembly  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:17):**  for Wales, to promote sustainable development in everything that it did. And amazingly,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:23):**  that proposition went through Parliament and into the first Government of Wales Act. So  
**[0:05:27-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:27):**  when Scotland and Northern Ireland and Wales all were devolved to new legislatures, Wales  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:34):**  was the only one that was given that duty to promote. And in fact, over the last 20  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:39):**  years, Wales has wrestled with that duty, the government has wrestled with that duty  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:43):**  in terms of what does a government that delivers with sustainable development, as its central  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:49):**  organising principle, look like. And by the time we got to 2011, it was decided that,  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:05:55):**  in fact, unless there was a law that required the government and all its public services  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:01):**  in Wales to deliver sustainable development in everything they did, rather than promote  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:07):**  sustainable development, then we wouldn't get an effective delivery.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:10):**  And it must be a huge difference for government because government tends to sort of work on  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:16):**  a one or two year basis when, you know, it's a couple of years when you get in that you  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:21):**  can actually deliver change and then you're immediately sort of starting to think about  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:25):**  the next election. So suddenly having to work on a kind of, you know, a future generation  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:29):**  basis, it must be really difficult for politicians who just aren't used to that at all.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:33):**  Well, I think that was a real part of it. I mean, it is an extraordinarily ambitious  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:38):**  agenda, particularly when you think that the Brundtland definition of sustainable development,  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:44):**  that does not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. When  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:48):**  we think in those terms, we think that politics is inherently short term, but actually the  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:06:54):**  challenges that face us on a daily basis are inherently long term in their effects and  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:00):**  often get worse and worse if we don't address them. So actually, the government of Wales  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:05):**  was incredibly brave when it put forward the law and the National Assembly for Wales was  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:10):**  incredibly brave when it passed the law. And I was sitting outside politics, having gone  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:15):**  into the university sector, and just in awe that these politicians had really debated  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:21):**  these issues and decided they did want a law to deliver, not a law to promote. And that  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:27):**  is very important because it does mean that the delivery of the aspirations of the Food  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:33):**  and Farming and Countryside Commission are going to be different in Wales because there  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:37):**  are different law and policy tools at our disposal. I mean, there's a common agenda  
**[0:07:42-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:42):**  which Sue has just outlined in terms of the production of healthy and nutritious food  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:46):**  that everyone can afford to eat, that can be delivered in better connected and more  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:50):**  sustainable farming systems, including agroecology, which fully integrate planning and decision  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:07:56):**  making about our land. And that was very much an agreement from the first report. But of  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:01):**  course, we have different political structures here as well. In May next year, the politicians  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:07):**  in Wales will go to election. So there's a particular opportunity for us here to think  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:13):**  about what structures do we need in government to ensure that decisions are not taken in  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:18):**  policy silos? What can we do to ensure that food is central to local decision making and  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:23):**  planning? What would happen if we put agroecology at the centre of the Welsh approach to the  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:29):**  wellbeing of future generations and our duties on public bodies enough to make the scale  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:34):**  of change needed? I think it's really interesting. I don't agree in some ways, Sue, her commissioners,  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:39):**  because they have a very important role, both in terms of looking at the best in every country  
**[0:08:45-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:45):**  in the UK, but also looking at the best and seeing how we can make the best better. I  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:51):**  think it's really interesting that you talk about the way that the Wellbeing of Future  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:08:55):**  Generations Act underpins an awful lot of the thinking that's going into environmental  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:00):**  and countryside and farming policy as we move forward. I wonder if you could talk about  
**[0:09:05-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:05):**  the way in which Welsh government policy differs from Westminster policy as we plan to leave  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:12):**  the European Union, as we think about the future of land use and agriculture?  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:16):**  Yes, I mean, I think what is interesting about the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act is,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:22):**  of course, it's not just a single pillar of government. It is actually a framework at  
**[0:09:28-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:28):**  the heart of government that covers all the government responsibilities in Wales. It's  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:32):**  overseen by a commissioner. It is overseen by the audit office. And if people outside  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:38):**  government or the public services in Wales who have the duty to deliver under it are  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:42):**  not content, they can go to law, they can seek a judicial review. And it redefines prosperity.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:49):**  I mean, for example, prosperity is now defined in Wales as an innovative, productive and  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:09:54):**  low carbon society, which recognises the limits of the global environment and uses resources  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:00):**  efficiently and proportionately, including acting on climate change. And when we think  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:05):**  about resilience, for example, which is very important in terms of the inquiry, it is described  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:10):**  in law as a nation which maintains and enhances a biodiverse natural environment with healthy  
**[0:10:17-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:17):**  functioning ecosystems that support social, economic and ecological resilience. And all  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:24):**  the goals, all seven of the goals, which link very closely to the Sustainable Development  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:28):**  Goals, have legal descriptions. So you can already start seeing that if you're going  
**[0:10:33-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:33):**  to use this narrative in the context of what the outcomes are going to be, then it will  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:40):**  require different kinds of behaviour.  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:43):**  So Jane, that's a really clear framework for the way that the Welsh government is likely  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:47):**  to sort of approach this as it goes forward. So you've worked with DEFRA, you've worked  
**[0:10:53-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:53):**  with people within the Welsh government. How do you feel, where do you feel the differences  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:10:57):**  are? I mean, there must be personality differences as well as priority differences. The Welsh  
**[0:11:01-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:01):**  government team is smaller, much better able to talk to, you know, they can talk to each  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:06):**  other more easily and actually come to a sort of cohesive view of the way forward in a way  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:11):**  that's much more difficult, I think, in DEFRA.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:14):**  I think that's a really good question, Finla. And one of the reasons I think that I have  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:18):**  a particular insight into this is that whilst I am chief executive of a UK based commission,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:24):**  I'm also a Welsh farmer. I live in Wales and I farm in Wales. And my experience of agricultural  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:30):**  support and agricultural policy is through the lens of the Welsh government. And over  
**[0:11:36-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:36):**  and over again, I hear my English colleague talking about their experiences with DEFRA  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:42):**  and the Royal Pavements Agency. And it is very, very different to mine. I feel generally  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:46):**  well supported. I feel that the Welsh government wants me to succeed. Down to basic things  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:52):**  like if I've, you know, if I've left it a bit late to get some forms in, they'll ring  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:11:57):**  me, rather than find me. And that is a very vivid, it's a small but it's a vivid illustration  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:03):**  of the different approach the Welsh government takes to farming and its farm community. I  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:07):**  think that shows up in the way that Welsh government and Welsh policy appreciates that  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:12):**  farming plays a really significant part in Welsh cultural life too. In the rural communities,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:19):**  particularly in mid and west and north Wales, it's often where the language resides and  
**[0:12:23-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:23):**  where really important aspects of Welsh cultural life are still rich and vibrant. And Welsh  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:31):**  government understands that that also needs to be supported in the context of a thriving  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:37):**  farming business and rural communities. The other difference that I think is really, really  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:41):**  important, I think it's going to get even more important in the coronavirus context.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:46):**  And as we think about what that means for resilience and adaptation for climate and  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:50):**  nature emergencies is that Wales is a small country. Jane mentioned earlier that very  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:12:56):**  often small countries, in fact, by and large, small countries have stronger bonds of trust  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:02):**  and relationship with their citizens. And in Wales, that shows up through the organisations  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:08):**  called the public service boards. The public services boards bring together the different  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:12):**  agencies at a local level and enable them to join up what is otherwise often very fragmented  
**[0:13:19-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:19):**  or siloed policy decisions, join them up and connect them on a place basis. And that is  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:26):**  a very different orientation to what I notice in England.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:30):**  So actually, this is one of the areas that the report looks at, isn't it? The need for  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:34):**  national government to connect with local government and regional decision making processes  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:39):**  as well. And I think, I mean, just in the conversations that I've heard around the approach  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:44):**  that the Welsh government is taking, there's a slightly more directive approach. So for  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:48):**  example, there are conversations about in order for farmers to get their financial support  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:53):**  on an annual basis, you know, should there be a requirement for carbon footprinting,  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:13:57):**  for example, on farming, and the measurement of various other outcomes, you know, so that's  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:01):**  quite a directive approach, whereas the English government approach is much more kind of left  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:05):**  to the market, we've got these public goods, you come up with your solution, if you want  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:10):**  to access that funding, otherwise, you know, don't worry, you can crack on, which runs  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:16):**  the risk of creating quite a patchwork. In some places, you have some really good action  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:21):**  in terms of public goods. And in other places, you have almost no action at all. Whereas  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:25):**  in Wales, it seems to be designed from the outset to be something which is delivered  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:30):**  whether the financial mechanisms are being used to make sure there's delivery across  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:34):**  the country. I think that's absolutely right. I think again, that that's a this is an illustration  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:39):**  of Wales is thinking in my view is more radical and more progressive than in England. So I  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:44):**  think Welsh Welsh government understands and is doing the work to make all land matter  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:50):**  and to join up those different drivers and levers for for farmers and land managers so  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:14:56):**  that if government is seeking to incentivise progress and development in one aspect, say  
**[0:15:02-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:02):**  carbon sequestration, they're not at the same time, allowing farmers to, you know, deplete  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:10):**  soil resources through farming practices elsewhere. So the whole farm approach, it appears the  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:16):**  whole farm approach. Exactly. So because it looks as though that is the approach that  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:21):**  is that Wales is going to adopt. It's not quite finalised yet. But let's say if we keep  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:26):**  saying it out loud often enough, it'll give them courage to step into this direction.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:31):**  But it's I think it's another manifestation actually, of how government of Wales is actually  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:36):**  very good at joining the dots between the sorts of policy silos that in other parts  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:42):**  of the UK often get separated and fragmented and picked off in those different buckets  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:48):**  of activity. My experience in England as well seems to indicate that there is government  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:54):**  is very quick and very keen to load responsibilities onto local authorities at the same time as  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:15:59):**  then stripping the amount of money that they have to deliver those responsibilities away.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:04):**  I think there are two critical things around the relationship between the Welsh government  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:09):**  and local authorities and all public services that are required to deliver on the Wellbeing  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:15):**  of Future Generations Act. As has already been described, the mechanism by which the  
**[0:16:20-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:20):**  public services deliver on the Act collaboratively is the public services boards. And they're  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:27):**  starting to come up with some really exciting ideas. One of the ones we highlighted in the  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:32):**  Wales report was one in which I was personally involved, which was looking about how we can  
**[0:16:38-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:38):**  use the critical mass of the public plate to procure new kinds of growing distribution  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:45):**  and production opportunities in Camarvonshire. And what was really interesting to me sitting  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:51):**  at the table discussing that was that as soon as we agreed it, and we let others know that  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:16:57):**  we'd agreed it, we had interest from across the UK, because everybody is looking for new  
**[0:17:03-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:03):**  mechanisms for procurement. Because we know if we're going to be able to bring the local  
**[0:17:09-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:09):**  benefit and the benefit back to the individual farmer or grower, if we're going to make that  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:15):**  a much fairer system, then we have to reward those people who do the work at the bottom  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:21):**  of the supply chain. And everybody was terribly excited about the idea that we could do something  
**[0:17:26-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:26):**  through public procurement, so much so that we've now won £100,000 through Welsh government  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:33):**  in terms of taking that idea forward. And we're going to be tracking that through the  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:37):**  inquiry. But importantly, it was the public services boards as a mechanism where all the  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:43):**  public authorities get together and they think about the best ideas for future generations  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:49):**  is becoming a real mechanism to drive change. And I think what's really important in that  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:54):**  relationship between Welsh government and local authorities is that everybody can get  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:17:59):**  in the room together. And therefore there has not been the kind of nakedly political  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:05):**  operation that we've seen in other parts of the UK in terms of how funding moves from  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:10):**  government to local authorities. What happens in Wales is that people will always think  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:15):**  there's not enough money in the system, that's the nature of it. But it is done according  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:21):**  to a formula which is agreed between the Welsh government and the Welsh Local Government  
**[0:18:26-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:26):**  Association. But the approaches are predicated not only on the wellbeing of Future Generations  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:33):**  Act, but also on the fact that the Welsh government was the first to declare a climate emergency  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:38):**  and the National Assembly for Wales was the first legislature to declare a climate emergency,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:44):**  which means that the Welsh government has the full support of the National Assembly  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:49):**  for Wales in taking action on climate. So as Sue has described, when you have that mechanism  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:18:55):**  in place, it means that the whole farm approach, the whole countryside approach, the whole  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:00):**  country approach can be taken forward in a coherent narrative.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:04):**  And you talk about the inquiry report and the way in which public procurement is at  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:09):**  the heart of that. And that's one of the four sort of big pillars of the report, isn't it  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:13):**  really? And talking about the way that public procurement can be used to increase and to  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:18):**  sustain the pace of change that's necessary. And when you talk about the climate emergency,  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:23):**  and if we put in parallel with that the biodiversity emergency that we face as well, the scale  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:28):**  of change that we need is actually really quite substantial. I mean, it's quite revolutionary.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:35):**  And so the role that public procurement can play in that must be absolutely fundamental  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:39):**  because it's such an enormous player. Absolutely, absolutely. Public procurement  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:44):**  brings an enormous amount of money from Keystone institutions into decision making, but it  
**[0:19:50-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:50):**  also has the opportunity to make commitments. And by making commitments to farmers and growers  
**[0:19:56-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:19:56):**  for the long term, it has a really powerful role to play to help the system as it is pivot  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:02):**  to the system as it needs to be. So as Jane was describing, a piece of work we did with  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:07):**  Wales for the main body of the report was to understand more about the relationship  
**[0:20:11-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:11):**  between public bodies, Keystone public institutions, and the farmers and growers who are looking  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:16):**  to get a bigger slice of that public pie. Public bodies would often say we would love  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:22):**  to work with local producers more, but it's not consistent enough, there's not enough  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:26):**  of it, it's difficult to contract with lots of small players, with lots of reasons in  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:31):**  their account of why it was in the too hard box. But by working with farmers and growers  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:36):**  and initiating some learning groups with farmers and growers, we were able to understand a  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:42):**  little bit more about what kinds of conditions they needed in order to be able to change  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:47):**  their growing, their farming practices, to be able to sell in more effectively to those  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:52):**  public institutions. And they talked about having a patient investment that enable them  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:20:59):**  to make changes. It takes, you can't just change your growing overnight, it can take  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:05):**  one, two, three, seven years to change a rotation on a farm to move from producing one kind  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:13):**  of food to something that is very different. And for farmers to be able to make what could  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:18):**  sometimes be a really significant investment in making the changes that we all know we  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:22):**  need in new agro-ecological farming systems, that they need to have some confidence that  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:27):**  they will be supported by the public institutions that in turn benefit from that change. So  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:32):**  bringing those conversations together felt to me to be a really important breakthrough  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:38):**  to understand more about what both sides of that contracting relationship really need.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:43):**  And again, I think this is a feature of being in a small country where politicians and policymakers  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:49):**  are in fact quite close to, physically close, as well as culturally close to the people  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:21:54):**  that they're talking with. So it has a real materiality, it's not an abstracted conversation,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:00):**  it has a real materiality in policy making, when you know that you're talking about this  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:05):**  farm, this village, this hospital, this school. So it really kind of, people have real skin  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:11):**  in the game and that shows through.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:13):**  I'm starting to grin as you talk about that. Years ago, I was General Secretary of the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:18):**  National Farmers Union on the Isle of Man and remember a situation where, when reforms  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:23):**  were being proposed, you know, there were schisms sort of starting to occur between  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:28):**  the farmers and the government. And actually, we just brought the President of the Union  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:31):**  round to the Minister's House and we had a cup of coffee and got it sorted. And there  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:35):**  is a real benefit to being able to do that. The smaller the country, the bigger that opportunity.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:40):**  But look, in the introduction, I talked quite a bit about the way in which the Commission  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:44):**  is really good at sort of putting people and landscape back in the heart of that conversation.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:49):**  We talked quite a lot about structures and that's been really important. And the policy  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:54):**  approaches, the policy differences between England and Wales and the opportunities in  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:22:58):**  Wales. I wonder, Sue, if you could reflect a little bit, are there unique challenges  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:03):**  that are actually facing Welsh farmers that are different to other farmers in other parts  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:08):**  of the UK or other parts of the world even? And what is it in particular that you think  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:12):**  that Welsh farming is really good at?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:15):**  So at the moment, Welsh farming tends to revolve around red meat production and red meat production  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:24):**  in a landscape that is largely what is called in European Union language, less favoured  
**[0:23:28-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:28):**  areas. And there are a number of reasons why that system of production is under threat  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:37):**  and is being challenged, partly because as a nation, we're eating less red meat, but  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:43):**  also because people are reflecting on the impact of those farming practices on Welsh  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:48):**  landscapes and whether or not those landscapes are better suited for other nature recovery  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:23:55):**  and climate mitigation practices like tree planting, for example.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:00):**  Or better, combining the two things together in the agroecological systems you were mentioning  
**[0:24:05-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:05):**  before.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:06):**  Well, that's exactly right. But at the moment, the debate tends to be somewhat polarised  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:10):**  and polarising. It's often presented as an either or. The solution is indeed, as you  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:16):**  say, Finlow, in a bit more both and how can we both mitigate impacts on climate, reverse  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:23):**  climate change? How can we reverse biodiversity loss, regenerate nature? How can we produce  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:29):**  more of the healthy fruit, vegetables and meat and dairy from sustainable sources that  
**[0:24:34-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:34):**  we know we need to be eating?  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:36):**  So I think it is true to say that for some farmers in some parts of Wales, some of their  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:42):**  farming practices are going to have to change. But I think there are also huge opportunities.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:46):**  At the moment, Wales grows a tiny fraction or an even smaller fraction of its land, of  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:52):**  the fruit and veg that we need to be eating more of. And as part of a globally responsible  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:24:57):**  Wales, taking more responsibility for growing more of the healthy fruit and veg that we  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:01):**  need to eat is a really critical component of that.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:04):**  So turning over some of the land that is currently under grass to more horticulture, or encouraging  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:10):**  the formation of market gardens around our towns and cities, creating perhaps a doughnut  
**[0:25:17-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:17):**  of horticulture around our towns and cities so that fresh produce is more quickly and  
**[0:25:23-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:23):**  easily available to people there. Encouraging new young entrants into farming and food production.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:30):**  One of our suggestions is to see community supported agriculture in every county in Wales  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:35):**  and providing opportunities for young people who are frankly really enthusiastic about  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:41):**  taking up this challenge to really get their hands dirty and take up that work themselves.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:46):**  We know the appetite is there. So some more matchmaking between making land available  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:51):**  for more sustainable food production closer to our centres of population is the opportunity  
**[0:25:57-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:57):**  that's waiting to be grasped.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:25:58):**  It's always been a frustration for me that particularly when the conversation is focused  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:03):**  too much on climate change and climate change alone, that you can have this really divisive  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:08):**  conversation where this bit of land just needs to be put to sit, goose, bruise, and so you  
**[0:26:12-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:12):**  can sequester as much as you possibly can. And one of the things that I think is really  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:16):**  helpful about the way that the Commission approaches things is that you are trying to  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:20):**  bring this range of public goods together and encourage systems in which land is producing  
**[0:26:26-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:26):**  multiple outcomes. So when you start combining biodiversity loss or biodiversity improvement  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:33):**  with climate policy, you get quite different results. And then when you load in the need  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:37):**  to sort of help and sustain local economies and keep that sort of strength of local jobs,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:42):**  then that becomes really powerful. But the idea on top of that, that there will be more  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:47):**  land put to fruit and veg, which is currently, as you say, largely imported and a localisation  
**[0:26:52-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:52):**  of some of those supply chains so that people are buying much more directly from individual  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:26:57):**  farmers or from co-operatives sounds fantastic.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:00):**  Absolutely. Well, I am a livestock farmer myself. I grow lamb and I grow beef, but I  
**[0:27:06-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:06):**  farm organically and I farm for conservation. So that means the breeds that I keep and grow  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:13):**  are well suited to thriving on what is sometimes called unimproved pasture. What that actually  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:18):**  means is that it's a real range of flora in the fields. And they convert that very effectively  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:25):**  to really high quality protein, slowly maturing over a longer period of time. So I like to  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:31):**  think that I'm finding a way of doing both. I'm producing really high quality and incredibly  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:37):**  tasty food, but I'm doing it in a way that enhances our environment, that it enhances  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:42):**  biodiversity and sequesters carbon. So it absolutely is possible to do both. We talk  
**[0:27:47-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:47):**  about more diverse, more localised systems. More diverse systems are always more resilient.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:27:55):**  What we've seen through the corona crisis has been this centralised consolidated systems  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:01):**  being most fragile. When retailers are reliant on one or two suppliers and they hit a crisis,  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:08):**  then the system can very quickly fall over. But more diverse systems, a variety of sizes  
**[0:28:12-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:12):**  of farm, a type of farm, of productive capacity is always likely to be more resilient, particularly  
**[0:28:19-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:19):**  at times of crisis.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:21):**  Diversity in the sward, diversity in systems, diversity in ideas. It's good stuff. Jane,  
**[0:28:26-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:26):**  we've looked there at some of the things that Welsh farming is really good at. We've talked  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:28):**  about some of the unique challenges that Welsh farmers are facing. I wonder if you're able  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:32):**  to identify any of the particular challenges that you think need addressing, some of the  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:38):**  bad practice perhaps that you're hoping will change as a result of this work.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:43):**  I think there are three key challenges for me. I think this point about how little of  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:49):**  our fruit and vegetables we grow is an absolutely critical one. And it's where horticulture  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:28:54):**  sits in the system as well, in terms of the value or otherwise of it. We only grow 2%  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:00):**  of our fruit and vegetable needs in Wales at the moment on 0.001% of our land. So the  
**[0:29:06-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:06):**  amounts are absolutely tiny. I'm a small holder. We keep pigs, we keep turkeys, we keep ducks,  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:14):**  we keep chickens. We grow as much of our own fruit and vegetables as we can. And we're  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:19):**  an area where a lot of other people do similarly. And that sustained us all incredibly well  
**[0:29:25-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:25):**  during the COVID crisis, in the sense that there were so many people who had small businesses  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:32):**  aware actually that they could provide food for others in the community. And so suddenly,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:38):**  local became really important. And we tell one particular story as well in our Wales  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:43):**  Field Guide about actually our local miller in my local village, where she'd been trying  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:49):**  for three years to get her flour into all the shops in Cardigan. And they're all tied  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:29:55):**  up with different arrangements. You know exactly what I'm going to say in the context of COVID.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:00):**  Along comes the problem, the supermarket and all shelves are cleared. And there we have  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:05):**  the miller of St. Dogmoor's is able to provide flour not only for this community, not only  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:11):**  for Cardigan, but actually now much wider afield. She now has delivered on her three  
**[0:30:17-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:17):**  year business plan in six weeks and created a whole new set of supply chain opportunities.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:23):**  So I think there's something around COVID where we do need to look at where the local  
**[0:30:27-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:27):**  has been able to step in and actually therefore has become a beacon of light that can be helped  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:34):**  in terms of sustaining to the next stage of their business plan. And I know that Sue and  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:39):**  the commissioners are really looking at that across the whole of the UK. The second challenge  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:44):**  and I use this as an example, is this challenge about supply chains. And who does what in  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:50):**  the context of supply chains? What is the role of local authorities? What is the role  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:30:54):**  of government in the context of supply chains? Because living very much in the in the west  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:00):**  of Wales, I do, you know, almost closer to Dublin than I am to, well, certainly close  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:06):**  to Dublin than I am to London. It means that actually it takes a long time for things to  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:10):**  get here and a long time for things to leave here. We don't have the road infrastructure,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:15):**  the railway infrastructure or went with the Beeching cuts in the 1960s. How do we get  
**[0:31:21-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:21):**  the best of the produce from West Wales into the rest of the UK? And of course, there'll  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:27):**  be plenty of examples in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland of similar issues. And  
**[0:31:31-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:31):**  whose responsibility is it? Because if we are going to create more opportunities for,  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:37):**  for example, community supported agriculture schemes in every community council, then where  
**[0:31:41-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:41):**  is their spare produce going to go? Because otherwise they will not have a workable business  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:46):**  plan. So I think that second issue around supply chains, when Wales has always been  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:51):**  on the periphery anyway, becomes a really important one. And the third issue, I'm afraid  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:31:57):**  is the climate change issue, in the sense that the UK Committee on Climate Change opined  
**[0:32:03-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:03):**  that Scotland could deliver on net zero by 2045, England by 2050, and Wales not until  
**[0:32:10-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:10):**  2055. And when asked why, it was the agricultural practices. 88% of Wales is agricultural land,  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:19):**  less favoured land. Of course, most of the farmers here farm beef and sheep with very,  
**[0:32:24-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:24):**  very good in Wales at growing grass. So what, you know, since we're so good at growing grass,  
**[0:32:30-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:30):**  what are the opportunities in Wales to diversify? And that's not for me about getting rid of  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:36):**  beef of sheep at all. It's about what is the place of what are the food supplies that we're  
**[0:32:42-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:42):**  going to need in ways that we can also address the climate deficit and the nature deficit.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:49):**  And therefore, these are really important discussions for the inquiry.  
**[0:32:53-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:53):**  You both mentioned COVID at different times. And of course, this report has been written  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:32:58):**  at the time of COVID. And I wonder if there are things about the coronavirus pandemic  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:03):**  that have informed the report and meant that the report is different than it would have  
**[0:33:08-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:08):**  been otherwise, Sue?  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:09):**  What we've learned through the corona crisis is that local really does matter. In the past,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:16):**  we made statements about how important localising systems will be in the future, when we were  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:22):**  thinking about the climate and nature crisis. But it has become incredibly important right  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:27):**  now. And what we've been living through in the last four, five months is in fact, a dress  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:33):**  rehearsal for what it really takes to build, support, sustain more resilient, more adaptive  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:40):**  communities. So a lot of the stuff that we've been talking about proposing for the next  
**[0:33:44-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:44):**  10 years has come to pass really quickly, looking at the way communities have responded  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:51):**  really creatively and imaginatively at a time of crisis.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:33:55):**  Lots of the stories, lots of the hero stories of the moment talk about big retail and big  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:01):**  institutional responses. But for me, the hero stories are coming from the grassroots. They're  
**[0:34:06-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:06):**  coming from the villages and communities around Wales, where without waiting to be instructed  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:12):**  by government or by a council, people worked out what their neighbours needed. They worked  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:18):**  out very quickly how they needed to get hold of it. They knew whether they were vulnerable,  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:22):**  shielding or safeguarding because they knew them as people and they went and did their  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:26):**  shopping for them. They went and got what they needed and brought them to their homes.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:31):**  They tapped on the windows to make sure people were safe. So the power of resilient, responsive,  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:37):**  adaptive communities has been demonstrated in vivid clarity in stories all around Wales.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:44):**  There's a lovely story in the Wales Inquiry Report from Kaus Kenaf, the cheese producer.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:50):**  It was a moment at the start of the crisis when hospitality, the whole hospitality sector  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:34:54):**  completely fell over. And for Carwin, who was supplying his cheese, his gorgeous cheese  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:00):**  into the hospitality sector, suddenly found he had shelves and shelves and shelves of  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:05):**  it that he was not going to be able to get rid of and that he was going to have to throw  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:08):**  away. And he put out a call on social media, on YouTube, and it was shared on Twitter to  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:13):**  say, we're about to go down. We're going to be wasting all our produce. If you can buy  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:17):**  some, we'll be really grateful. But actually, if you just want some, let us know because  
**[0:35:21-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:21):**  I'd rather give it away than waste it. And he was inundated with responses, absolutely  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:27):**  inundated, didn't have to give any away, was able to find a home for all of it and had  
**[0:35:32-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:32):**  to close his orders. And that story is replicated around Wales where small local producers in  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:40):**  putting out a call had it responded to absolutely in spades by people, not just in Wales, but  
**[0:35:46-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:46):**  across the UK who have a real warmth and connection with products, with provenance and with producers  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:54):**  who want to have a relationship with their customers and with their communities. So I  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:35:59):**  think it's been very, very difficult and dark times for many people. And some parts of the  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:04):**  sector, the hospitality sector will take still some time to recover and it will not be the  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:09):**  same for many years. But there are also many silver linings in this experience. And I think  
**[0:36:16-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:16):**  it is helping us understand in real granular detail what really matters to us. And that  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:21):**  comes down to very often where we live and who we live with, our community, our neighbours,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:27):**  our relationships. And when a crisis hits, that's what matters.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:31):**  And so the hope is that out of this dark cloud, as you put it, a silver lining is there that  
**[0:36:36-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:36):**  we've seen this acceleration of change in systems to deliver greater resilience at local  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:42):**  level, focus around provenance, as you say, and under support between the people who grow  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:47):**  food and the people who eat food using social media, which is fantastic. And Jane, you mentioned  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:52):**  that the Miller who had accelerated her business plan. Do you think that her success will be  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:36:59):**  sustained? Do you envisage a situation where those shops that are now stocking her product  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:04):**  will continue stocking her product as well if we ever move out of the coronavirus time?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:10):**  Yes, I do. In that circumstance, I very much do because there isn't a competitive mill  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:16):**  as it were. So I'm absolutely confident that they will. Not least because the main bakery  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:21):**  in Cardigan has been using her flour for a number of years to bake bread anyway. So in  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:27):**  a sense, the provenance and the quality have been demonstrated. I do think there's one  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:33):**  area though that we have to very much keep in mind in this context. I'm acutely aware  
**[0:37:38-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:38):**  that Cardigan Food Bank, which is my local food bank, had a massive increase in calls  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:46):**  on its resource during COVID. And we did also see a commensurate increase in people funding  
**[0:37:53-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:53):**  the food bank as well. But the most of those, the food bank regular source was from people  
**[0:37:59-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:37:59):**  dropping tins into supermarkets and then those supermarkets handing that down to the food  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:04):**  bank. And of course, during COVID that has not happened in the same way at all. And they  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:09):**  have relied and had to rely on huge increase in terms of personal donations to the food  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:16):**  bank. And when you're looking at such massive increases, you realise just how many people  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:22):**  are needing that resource. So I was particularly pleased to see that the part one of the National  
**[0:38:27-0:38:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:27):**  Food Strategy explicitly talked about addressing some of those areas of disadvantage. And in  
**[0:38:34-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:34):**  Wales and Scotland, interestingly enough, have kept school meals going, have provided  
**[0:38:39-0:38:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:39):**  them through the summers, and we're going to continue to do that without any input from  
**[0:38:44-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:44):**  Marcus Rashford, for example. So there was already a wellbeing economics approach in  
**[0:38:51-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:51):**  both of those smaller countries. And I think that's where the narrative is important, that  
**[0:38:56-0:39:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:38:56):**  by having a wellbeing of future generations act in Wales, that narrative means that you  
**[0:39:01-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:01):**  do act more preventatively, you are thinking long term, so you will make different decisions.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:07):**  And I think that we all have to keep our eye particularly on that word just in the context  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:13):**  of how food is delivered for the future. Because if a government cannot look after the most  
**[0:39:18-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:18):**  vulnerable in its population, one could argue, what is the purpose of government? And I do  
**[0:39:24-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:24):**  feel confident that through the wellbeing of future generations act and before that  
**[0:39:30-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:30):**  the government of Wales will rise to that challenge, whichever political party it is,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:36):**  because of that commitment within a small nation. So there's a combination of hopes  
**[0:39:40-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:40):**  and aspirations, accelerated change as a result of coronavirus, but also that sobering note  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:46):**  at the end, Jane, and the hope that, as you say, that Wales will be successful in making  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:51):**  sure that the systems work for everybody as a result of that all important act of parliament.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:39:58):**  That's all we have time for. We could carry on this conversation, I'm sure, but we have  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-happening-to-food--agriculture-in-Wales-ehlj29#t=0:40:01):**  to stop. I'd like to thank my guests, Sue Pritchard, the Chief Executive of the Food,

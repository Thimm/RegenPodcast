### Farm Gate  (Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:42:14)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finn Logue-Kustain. In the drive to improve food sustainability,  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:12):**  meat is often caught in the crosshairs. NGOs and active food citizens regularly criticise  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:17):**  the climate, nature and welfare impacts of the meat industry. A solution, a compromise  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:23):**  perhaps, is summarised in the mantra less and better.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:27):**  But what does less and better mean? What does it look like? And is it fair to treat the  
**[0:00:31-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:31):**  meat industry as some sort of sustainability pariah?  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:34):**  Well, to help me answer that question, I'm joined by Dr Sarah Place, Chief Sustainability  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:39):**  Officer at Alanko Animal Health and former Senior Director for the United States National  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:44):**  Cattlemen's Beef Association. And I'm joined by Oystein Torsen, the Director of  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:48):**  FAI Farms, a global consultancy working for climate and food security.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:53):**  Perhaps we could start by asking you both to introduce yourselves and maybe within that  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:00:58):**  you could tell us how you approach this question of less and better.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:03):**  Yeah, sure. So, as you said, I'm the Chief Sustainability Officer at Alanko Animal Health.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:07):**  I'm an animal scientist, so I did my graduate work at the University of California, Davis,  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:13):**  originally from upstate New York, grew up on a dairy farm there and have spent some  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:19):**  time in academia and in industry, so kind of a cross section of experiences. And in  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:24):**  terms of the less and better, I think we'll get into it in this conversation. But I think  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:28):**  sometimes it's just a question of what does that really mean, right? Because both less  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:33):**  and better are subjective terms. And Oystein, what does less and better mean  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:38):**  to you? Well, I think it's often framed around rich  
**[0:01:41-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:41):**  countries, right? Because we've seen a clear trend towards increased meat consumption with  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:48):**  rising levels of income, both in Europe, the US, but also in China and emerging economies.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:01:55):**  And I think that in a world where 820 million people are going hungry, 2 billion people  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:01):**  are overweight and obese, I think there's little doubt that many of us could benefit  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:06):**  from eating better. And in many cases, this might mean eating less. But I think specifically  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:13):**  applied to meat, the phrase does have an opportunity to create some common ground and meaningful  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:18):**  dialogue in a conversation that is, like many others these days, often defined by fairly  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:24):**  polarized views. The situation looks very different depending  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:28):**  on where you are in the world, right? So for the wealthy nations of the world, whether  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:33):**  it's in Europe or North America, historically, we have consumed a lot more just in general  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:40):**  animal source food, we lump all meat and eggs and dairy and fish together than other parts  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:46):**  of the world. And as was mentioned, some of that is driven by really just the production  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:51):**  system realities in different countries. So I think that's super key to talk about as  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:02:57):**  well. So sometimes we just lump in, we just say meat and we just lump everything in together.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:02):**  But what we've seen pretty consistently in most of the wealthier countries over the last  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:08):**  30, 40 years is really the shift kind of away from red meat. And so by red meat, I'm specifically  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:14):**  talking about our ruminant meats, whether it's beef or lamb and pork to some extent,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:21):**  and a shift towards more poultry. So mostly chicken and some turkey as well. So we've  
**[0:03:25-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:25):**  seen that in the United States. Specifically, it's kind of interesting from 1970 to today,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:32):**  we're eating roughly about the same amount of meat, but the composition of that meat  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:36):**  has changed. So we eat like, essentially we were eating about three ounces of beef per  
**[0:03:41-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:41):**  person per day in the mid 1970s in the United States. And now it's down to about 1.8 ounces,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:47):**  but we're eating a lot more chicken. So it's actually kind of been a wash if you will.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:50):**  Right. So we're eating the same amount of meat as we were in the seventies.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:54):**  And actually just to let me break in that mean just to get into those figures about  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:03:58):**  the amount of meat that's eaten, I think that's going to be quite a surprise for some of the  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:02):**  people listening, particularly in the UK, because the image that we have of the United  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:07):**  States is of great big steak houses to a large extent. The image is that we have of cattle  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:12):**  farming usually aren't the kind of ranches that you associate with a cowboy movie, but  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:19):**  it's these great big feedlots, sort of fueling the steak houses and the picture you're painting  
**[0:04:24-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:24):**  is a little bit different and rather more nuanced.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:27):**  Yeah. And so this information that I'm talking about, one, to clarify, right, this is an  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:32):**  average number. Essentially, this is how much is available per capita. So, of course, individuals  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:37):**  may have different eating patterns, right? Obviously, some people don't eat beef, some  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:40):**  people maybe eat more, but that's what it averages out to. And I think that is really  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:44):**  key is that, you know, it's just as we were alluding to, right, there's a lot of imagery,  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:48):**  a lot of emotion that goes into our perceptions of this issue versus the data. And sometimes  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:53):**  those things are heading opposite directions. But in the United States, and this is important  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:04:58):**  too, you know, ruminant agriculture are cattle, sheep and goats, regardless of where they're  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:03):**  raised in the world really is a forage and grazing based system. And that's true in the  
**[0:05:07-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:07):**  United States, too. So those large feedlots that people have probably the image in their  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:12):**  mind when they think about US beef production, that's where cattle are going to spend the  
**[0:05:16-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:16):**  last four or six months of their life, right? So the vast majority of cattle at any one  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:21):**  time in the United States are out on grass grazing. And part of why we are such a major  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:27):**  beef producer in the world is because of the vast grassland resources that we have in the  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:32):**  United States.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:33):**  If you were looking forward 10 or 20 years, do you think that the feedlot would still  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:37):**  exist or do you think perhaps there might be a more grass finishing, I suppose, on ranch  
**[0:05:43-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:43):**  land?  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:44):**  I don't think the feedlot is going to go away. And honestly, it's not just a US phenomenon,  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:48):**  right? We, you know, even in the UK, if you look at how cattle are finished or in Australia  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:53):**  or in parts of South America, I mean, this is not just a US phenomenon. But I do think,  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:05:59):**  you know, again, it kind of brings up some of these questions of digging in more to the  
**[0:06:03-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:03):**  context, right? And this idea of regenerative agriculture is actually not mutually exclusive  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:10):**  from feeding cattle and finishing them in a feedlot either. Right. I think that's important  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:14):**  to clarify. Right. So what we see in the United States is we definitely have a lot of producers  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:20):**  that would consider themselves regenerative or part of holistic management. And they sell  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:26):**  those cattle into the so-called conventional finishing system. Right. And there's really  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:31):**  no differentiation if you were to go to a Walmart, if you will, in the United States  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:35):**  of whether this calf was raised from a regenerative ranch or somebody that doesn't consider themselves  
**[0:06:42-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:42):**  that way. Right. So I think that's important, too, is that we sometimes we draw firm boundaries  
**[0:06:47-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:47):**  around things that actually don't have firm boundaries.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:50):**  As you say that you're making me think that, you know, there's a degree to which this question  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:54):**  is is kind of the wrong question. And therefore it's almost impossible to come up with the  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:06:58):**  right answer because we're often talking within the food community about or complaining about  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:05):**  the way in which, you know, this global organization or that global organization comes out with  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:10):**  a diet saying this is what people should be eating in order to improve climate change  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:15):**  outcomes, improve biodiversity outcomes. But the reality is that we what we eat needs to  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:20):**  be different in different places around the world. And so in some places it may mean less  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:25):**  meat in some places in sub-Saharan Africa. It might actually mean more animal protein.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:31):**  It's the wrong question. It's what's most sustainable. Yeah. And I think it's just very  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:35):**  difficult. I guess it's always to me, I find that very difficult to try to say, you know,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:40):**  this this is what you should eat in this location. Right. Because the supply chains are so difficult  
**[0:07:45-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:45):**  to trace. Right. And trying to change, you know, again, for example, the diets of hundreds  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:51):**  of millions of people in the United States or in Europe to try to make these incremental  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:07:55):**  changes in the production side. I guess that's where I'm more of just almost like a pragmatic  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:00):**  person where I think, you know what, our opportunity is probably greater on the supply side and  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:04):**  making sure to your point that wherever we are, we're doing the smartest thing in terms  
**[0:08:09-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:09):**  of producing food. Right. And agriculture is just a big carbon capture system, energy  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:17):**  transformation system that we're doing it in a way that makes the most sense in the  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:21):**  long term where we're at. And I think even in the U.S., I'll just say, too, we have a  
**[0:08:24-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:24):**  lot of folks that are cattle feeders that are very, very aware of the challenges with  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:30):**  regard to water use and thinking about, you know, how can they incorporate more grazing  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:36):**  of what we call stock or cattle and essentially bringing cattle in at heavier body weights  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:41):**  into feed yards and having shorter finishing time. So there's lots of innovations I think  
**[0:08:46-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:46):**  that are happening on the ground that I think are encouraging that, again, don't necessarily  
**[0:08:49-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:49):**  fit in these, to your point, these these ways that we frame things as like, you know, one  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:54):**  global diet to rule them all that I think is largely impractical at the end of the day.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:08:59):**  And I guess when we're talking about beef oyston, you know, we're talking about, you  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:04):**  know, cattle that are largely on grass for a lot of their lives then coming into, you  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:09):**  know, a finishing system of varying different kinds around the world. But when we're talking  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:13):**  about, you know, other kinds of meat, I mean, the vast majority of pork that's eaten around  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:18):**  the world, the vast majority of chicken is grown, you know, from birth to finishing in  
**[0:09:25-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:25):**  much more intensive systems. So I guess, I guess my question is, rather than saying less  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:31):**  meat, do we actually mean less intensive rearing of animals for meat?  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:36):**  Yeah, I think many people would absolutely agree with that statement. And I think Sarah's  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:41):**  point earlier about the supply side is really important in answering that question. Because  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:48):**  I think if you look at something like chicken, the fact that we eat that much more chicken  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:53):**  now than we used to, I always said, you know, I don't think that is because consumers banded  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:09:59):**  together and demanded to eat chicken three times a day. I think it's, you know, it's  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:04):**  more a result of sort of structural changes and developments on the supply chain, on the  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:09):**  supply side that made the, you know, the modern broiler industry possible in large part due  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:14):**  to, you know, cheap and available commodities and resources, you know, breed developments.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:21):**  As a result drove, you know, supply up and prices down to an extent where essentially  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:27):**  it was, why wouldn't you serve chicken as often as you could or why wouldn't you, you  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:32):**  know, why wouldn't you buy it because it's right there in front of you and it's become  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:38):**  very affordable. And I think if we look at it through that frame, I think there is a,  
**[0:10:43-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:43):**  there is a danger of sort of personalizing, if you like, our planetary challenges, right?  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:50):**  When we go straight to the sort of the individual choices, your diet that needs to change. I  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:10:55):**  feel like it's sort of deja vu from the 90s where all you had to do was to change your  
**[0:11:01-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:01):**  light bulbs and we would solve the climate crisis. Today, the simple solution is just  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:08):**  change your diet, except it's not simple and it's probably, you know, probably not even  
**[0:11:13-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:13):**  the solution, you know, relying on 7 billion people to change their personal cultural behavior  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:21):**  patterns is an extremely difficult way to affect systemic change. And I think, you know,  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:27):**  if we go too far down that route, I think we risk, by blaming the individual, I think  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:32):**  we risk taking our sort of collective attention away from more structural changes. And that  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:38):**  could be things like, you know, how do we better put the half a trillion dollars of  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:42):**  public subsidies around the world as going into farming and food production to better  
**[0:11:47-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:47):**  use to drive those positive outcomes we need to see in terms of soil health and carbon  
**[0:11:53-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:53):**  sequestration? How do we most effectively, you know, decarbonize our economy and bring  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:11:58):**  our sort of production systems, if you like, within our planetary boundaries, whether it's  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:03):**  carbon pricing or other legislation initiatives, or how do we incentivize producers to create  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:10):**  a more resilient and healthy food system? How do we, you know, how do we put more money  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:14):**  in the hands of those farmers that Nasera was talking about earlier, that really care  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:18):**  about their land and want to do, you know, want to do right both for their land and their  
**[0:12:24-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:24):**  animals? There's quite a lot to unpack there in what  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:27):**  you were just saying. And I think, you know, there are a couple of frames that you brought  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:31):**  up and I just got to summarize them around waste, you know, certainly in terms of supply  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:35):**  chain waste and nutrition. And interestingly, the Food Farming and Countryside Commission  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:40):**  that recently reported in the UK, you know, it was looking sustainability in terms of,  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:44):**  you know, not just meat, but the food industry more broadly, was most of their framing or  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:49):**  an awful lot of their framing was around health. And I guess if we're looking at trying to  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:12:56):**  feed an ever rising global population with the resources that we have, there's often  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:03):**  this sort of talk, well, we need to increase food production because there are going to  
**[0:13:06-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:06):**  be so many more people. Well, actually, it's distribution of food, perhaps, and consumption  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:12):**  of food, the habits that we have eating food, which are more of an issue. And if we look  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:16):**  at waste, you know, I've seen many reports recently that have talked about it's not just  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:21):**  that third of food or more that physically gets wasted in the fields or thrown away by  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:26):**  retailers or bought on a buy one, get one free and thrown away in the home. But actually,  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:32):**  because people are having that, you know, you mentioned, Oystein, having chicken three  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:35):**  times a day that that there is an overconsumption of protein, which just ends up as fat or being,  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:43):**  you know, weed or excreted away. And and so that's that's part of the waste equation,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:48):**  at which point potentially wasting half of the food that's produced. So that supply chain  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:53):**  element is is really important. Yeah. So I think I think there's a lot there, too, in  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:13:58):**  terms of both on, you know, what are we actually consuming and what what has increased? So  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:04):**  as I mentioned earlier, you know, in the United States, we're eating roughly the same amount  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:09):**  of animal source food as we did in the 1970s. So that's always my question is, were we eating  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:13):**  too much animal source food than to what are the criteria? I think this gets back to our  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:18):**  earlier part of the conversation of what are the criteria and the evidence sources that  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:22):**  we're using when we say these things. Right. And who gets to decide what is too much? So  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:27):**  I think on the protein piece specifically, it often comes back to protein, because if  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:33):**  we were to just zoom out and think about our whole agricultural system of all the the macronutrients  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:39):**  like carbohydrates, fat and protein, protein really is the hardest one for us to make.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:45):**  If we think about it from an agricultural perspective, whether it is, you know, from  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:48):**  plant sources or animal sources directly, it's the one that usually has the lowest availability  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:53):**  per capita. And even, you know, I'm looking at some of the information from the UN Food  
**[0:14:57-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:14:57):**  and Agriculture Organization from the UK, just total availability before adjusting for  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:03):**  losses. Looks like 71% of the calories in the UK food supply actually come from plant  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:09):**  source foods. Right. And 29% come from animal source foods. But if we're to look at the  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:15):**  protein, 57% of the protein comes from animal source foods and only 43% from plant source.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:21):**  So I think the reason that that stat is important, the fact that more protein comes from animal  
**[0:15:26-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:26):**  source foods than calories is that sometimes this conversation we talk about calorie availability,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:32):**  or we talk about just reducing the consumption of these animal source foods. And I think  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:37):**  we have to be realistic about what would displace that chicken or whatever is in somebody's  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:42):**  diet. Would it be, you know, good fruits and vegetables? Or would it be something else  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:48):**  that maybe again, is more energy rich and nutrient poor? And I think that some of that  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:52):**  is unknowable. But I also don't think we should just assume that the change would be positive,  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:15:58):**  if that makes sense.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:00):**  It's an excellent point. And it's a discussion that I've seen in, you know, in other sectors  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:04):**  too in seafood. You know, it also brings us maybe, what does less mean? One frame to look  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:11):**  at this is obviously specifically around what is our kind of physiological protein requirement,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:17):**  as you mentioned, Finlow. And that is where some of this is not that controversial. Right?  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:23):**  So if we're looking at most estimates, whether it's USDA or government, other governments,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:29):**  nutritional advice or academic studies, you know, they would say we need about 50 to 70  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:35):**  grams of protein, you know, depending on our body size. Every meal provides a third of  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:40):**  the protein you need during the day. Then a sort of typical, say, fast food fish sandwich  
**[0:16:46-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:46):**  with about 15 or 18 grams of protein holds enough protein for that meal. And because  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:53):**  our bodies can't store the excess protein, you know, it will be, as Finlow said, it will  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:16:58):**  be expelled from our body. There's sort of no point in eating more than those 15 to 18  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:04):**  grams every meal.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:06):**  I can hear Sarah that you're ready to come in there. But what I want to do actually is  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:10):**  just going to move the conversation on a little bit. So I think we've talked about less a  
**[0:17:14-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:14):**  lot. And I think we, you know, to some extent, we've come to the conclusion that we're not  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:18):**  quite sure actually what less means and that there are, you know, different frames that  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:23):**  we can apply. But if we move on to, you know, the better aspect of the phrase less and better,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:29):**  then perhaps you can answer what Oystein was talking about there in terms of that. You  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:34):**  know, whether, what does better mean? What are those priorities? I mean, we all want  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:39):**  things to be better, but what does it mean? Is it better land use, better profits for  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:43):**  farmers, better food security, better environmental outcomes or better health? Perhaps we could  
**[0:17:49-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:49):**  start from there.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:50):**  Yeah, yeah, I think that's very key. And we can think about it from a food security standpoint  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:17:55):**  of I think with nutrition, it's really challenging, right? Because sometimes the way we talk about  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:02):**  nutrition and sustainability is through this lens of preventing chronic disease. And sometimes  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:08):**  the way we talk about it is kind of what was just touched on a more nutrient adequacy standpoint  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:13):**  and those things sometimes get muddled up together. And that's part of the confusion  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:16):**  too. And even on the protein, I think there's a, and I say this as, you know, I'm an animal  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:22):**  scientist, right? I think there's a very big misinterpretation of what the recommended  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:26):**  daily allowance for protein is in and what it is not in humans. So essentially there  
**[0:18:31-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:31):**  were studies done on how much, how much protein do you have to eat to prevent nitrogen loss  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:38):**  as a human being? And that's kind of that range that you're giving that 50 to 70, depending  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:42):**  on how, how much you weigh, it's usually expressed as 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, right?  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:49):**  That's what's the, the U S and the close to the WHO standard is. And that is truly the  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:54):**  amount that you need to eat to make sure you don't lose skeletal muscle. And I would argue  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:18:59):**  there's a difference between that and optimum and like, and what we, you know, quote unquote  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:04):**  should be eating. And it's always strange to me. It's like with protein, the bare minimum  
**[0:19:09-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:09):**  is put forward as the maximum. Be careful that we, we recognize there's a, there's a  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:16):**  range, right? Of what you can eat. And, you know, again, that, that comes back to the  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:20):**  definition of, of overconsumption, but, but to your point, Finlow about better, I mean,  
**[0:19:25-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:25):**  that's, that's part of it too, right? Is what, what are the criteria that we are, what we  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:29):**  care most about? And I think this, even this discussion on the nutrition, I think we have  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:33):**  to recognize that there's going to be differences of what people prioritize. And we had to think  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:38):**  about how do we create a food system that allows that flexibility? You know, if I'm  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:42):**  somebody that I care most about climate change, and I want to think about driving down CO2  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:48):**  emissions per, per kilocalorie that I consume, maybe I make totally different decisions than  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:54):**  if I care most about animal welfare. And I think we just have to recognize that some  
**[0:19:59-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:19:59):**  of this isn't ever going to perfectly balance, but we have to try to move, if you will, in  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:03):**  a directionally correct way for a lot of these different categories.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:07):**  And this is a challenge, isn't it? Because it's a challenge for governments and it's  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:10):**  a challenge for food companies themselves. And one of the things that, that I always  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:14):**  say when I'm talking to government is that, you know, we shouldn't be trying to solve  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:19):**  climate change by itself. We need to be doing it at the same time as trying to restore and  
**[0:20:24-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:24):**  maintain biodiversity because there's an equal catastrophe sort of looming. We need to be  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:28):**  improving or where it's good maintaining good animal welfare and maintaining a diversity,  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:34):**  diversified sort of rural economy where there are family farms, family businesses that are  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:39):**  able to thrive and, you know, and grow their businesses. And all those aspects are really  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:45):**  important. And if we're just targeting one, we're going to lead to some really quite perverse  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:50):**  outcomes. Yeah, I think that's a great point. And that's,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:52):**  that's always the challenge. It's not, you know, it's so easy to focus on just one aspect  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:20:56):**  of this, you know, but, but to your point that can have collateral damage that is unintended  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:02):**  if we do go down that route. And that's where I think food is, food is different than say,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:06):**  you know, how we have to tackle the climate change challenge of energy production, right?  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:11):**  Because everybody has to eat, right? And we do have nutrient requirements and we do have  
**[0:21:15-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:15):**  diversity of ecosystems that we're dealing with. And we just have, you know, natural  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:21):**  variability. And so we have to think about resiliency of our system in ways that maybe  
**[0:21:26-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:26):**  other segments of our economy do not. So I think it is just wildly complex. And I, I  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:33):**  think that's where when we, when we use those words less and better, we can, we can get  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:37):**  behind, you know, general concepts, but I do think we had to get down to the concrete,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:41):**  what does it actually mean? And I think you had mentioned this earlier, when we say less,  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:46):**  I know having worked for cattle producers, that's like, this is a trigger word for them,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:52):**  right? And I almost think like the collateral damage of this conversation in terms of alienating  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:21:58):**  groups of people that should be working together has been underestimated. I really think that  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:03):**  there's a lot of natural alliances there between people that truly care about the environment  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:07):**  and agriculturalists, but they sometimes feel almost like attacked, right? Or they, they're  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:14):**  like, well, you think my life's work, what I do is terrible. Why would I work with you?  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:19):**  Right. If that makes sense.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:20):**  It's really interesting because, you know, when, when I, when I kind of think back to  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:24):**  the work that we've done on climate change over the course of the last few years, particularly  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:27):**  in the UK, an awful lot of that has been about trying to reframe the language, move it away  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:32):**  from talking about polar bears. Everyone cares about a polar bear. They're not going to change  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:36):**  their life to save it necessarily. And so how do we reframe that in a, in a way that  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:40):**  is mobilizing for the general public by talking about agricultural land, by talking about  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:46):**  food security and impact on, on land management, by talking about flooding and the way that  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:51):**  our homes are vulnerable. That's how we, we started to change the conversation on climate  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:22:56):**  change. And so many NGOs are using this less and better phrase. And yet if, if what you're  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:02):**  saying is right, and, and, you know, I'm sure that it is that just the framing itself is  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:07):**  alienating, then we kind of need to grow up quite quickly and, and move away from that  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:12):**  language and find language, which is, which is embracing, which makes farmers and landowners  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:19):**  feel empowered to do something really good and feel valued for doing something really  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:24):**  good instead of this kind of, you know, slightly aggressive, even though it's not meant to  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:28):**  be framing that we have at the moment.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:29):**  Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I guess that's a, you know, that is a point for us  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:33):**  also to really focus the conversation on better, right. Rather than, rather than less, because  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:39):**  better could mean better margin, you know, better pay, better, you know, better production  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:43):**  systems, et cetera. And I think that does, you know, that, that is where the food system,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:48):**  I guess, at the moment has a, has a challenge around really differentiating. We don't, you  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:53):**  know, we don't always know the, that a type of beef or a type of vegetable has been produced  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:23:59):**  in vastly different ways and that that has, has different outcomes in terms of, in terms  
**[0:24:04-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:04):**  of things that we care about. So I'd say, you know, we need to move the conversation  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:10):**  to better. And I think we will always be in a point that Sarah mentioned that people,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:15):**  people care more, we care about different things, right. And we do want to, you know,  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:20):**  people will be looking around for, for, for, for products and processes and companies,  
**[0:24:25-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:25):**  et cetera, that sort of align with, with what they care about. And for many, I think better  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:31):**  in terms of food refers to, refers to animal welfare. We haven't talked so much about that  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:36):**  so far. So if you think about chicken, you know, we've seen a bit of a move around the  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:41):**  world lately, both in the US and, and, and Europe towards companies considering those  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:48):**  lower stocking densities. There's a call for, for alternative breeds of birds that are,  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:54):**  you know, slower growing and have a higher welfare outcomes, provision of sort of environmental  
**[0:24:59-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:24:59):**  enrichments that allow the chickens to sort of express more of their, their natural behaviors.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:06):**  Some of this is obviously driven by, by campaigns, but some of it might also just be driven by,  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:12):**  I don't know, an awareness or discomfort maybe with, with some of the highly intensive production  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:18):**  systems. And in that case, less might become a way for companies or individuals to sort  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:25):**  of cover the added expense of producing that chicken that, you know, some, some consider  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:30):**  a considered better. So, you know, whether that's through, through again, portion sizes  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:35):**  or better, better utilization of the, of the full carcass or, or simply just eating their  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:41):**  better chicken one day, one day less a week.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:44):**  Yeah. And, and, you know, when we're talking about less, you know, the, the, the less part  
**[0:25:48-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:48):**  of the conversation almost just doesn't need to be said because in some cases, you know,  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:52):**  it will by default become less, there will be fewer chickens from a system with lower  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:25:58):**  stocking density and, and a breed change. And, and so those other conversations that  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:03):**  you just raised are kind of important. But from that perspective, that better bit really  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:09):**  becomes critical because a farmer needs to believe that they're going to at least sustain  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:14):**  similar levels of profit and ideally increase that either by shortening the supply chain,  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:20):**  selling directly to consumers perhaps, or working within a supply chain where each,  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:25):**  each chicken they're producing is more highly valued and therefore, you know, they're, they're  
**[0:26:29-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:29):**  earning a bit more money.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:30):**  Yeah, no, I think you just brought up a really great point. And I think this is one of the  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:33):**  challenges too, even some of those figures that I presented earlier, right, about per  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:37):**  capita consumption. You know, if you had an economist on there, they would, they would  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:41):**  emphasize, you know, per capita availability is not demand, right. And it's to the point  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:46):**  that you just made that willingness to pay aspect and the total dollars within the animal  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:51):**  agricultural system, the total dollars that get back to the producer aren't necessarily  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:26:56):**  always positively or negatively correlated with per capita availability, right. So I  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:02):**  think your point about thinking about how you structure the supply side and then some  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:06):**  of these other aspects are almost just going to, they're going to take care of themselves,  
**[0:27:10-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:10):**  if you will, I think is important because in some ways we almost see that with the,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:16):**  the beef situation that, you know, per capita availability of beef, as I mentioned in most  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:21):**  developing countries has gone down, it hasn't increased much in developing countries. And  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:25):**  so really what we've seen is a fairly flat and even slightly declining per capita availability  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:30):**  of beef around the world. But in the United States, we've seen in the last 20 years,  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:36):**  the total dollars within the system has increased, right. And that has been providing a product  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:41):**  that has seen as more highly valuable for people. And so I think that's, that's maybe  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:45):**  again, one of those ways to lower the blood pressure around this conversation is again,  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:50):**  just focusing on, focusing on that, that lived experience, that reality of, of the animals  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:27:55):**  of the people in the system and, and figuring out how do you capture more value for those  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:00):**  folks and, and kind of focus more on that. I think we'll, I think we'll drive more positive  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:05):**  change if we, if we look at it that way.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:07):**  So, so if we, I think, I think it feels like we're kind of moving onto the ground where  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:12):**  we're kind of defining sustainability as being, you know, part ethical, part environmental,  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:17):**  but that economics really needs to be sort of central to that as well. It's, you know,  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:21):**  it's that sort of third leg without which the, the stool falls over, the whole system  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:26):**  falls over. And so I wonder if we can, we can just sort of, you know, think for a minute  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:30):**  about where those win-wins are, you know, what the, what the things are that we can  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:34):**  agree on and at the same time, think about the way in which people do have different  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:38):**  frames. They shop for different frames in just the same way that, that NGOs will advocate  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:44):**  in different frames. And so how can we help customers, people who are going out and buying  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:50):**  food or going to a restaurant and, and buying a meal, ordering a meal, how can we help them  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:28:55):**  to understand that sustainability isn't about one thing or another, that it's a combination  
**[0:29:02-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:02):**  of things. And then also to find, find products that fit in with that sort of definition of  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:07):**  sustainability. Yeah, I think, I think that's challenging.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:11):**  There's a few different ways to think about it. We can think about it as more that kind  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:14):**  of niche marketing and targeting certain people, or we can think about, do we, do we want to  
**[0:29:19-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:19):**  do that or do we want to move the whole system incrementally, you know, towards better outcomes?  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:25):**  And I think your, your question about where some of those win-wins, I think there actually  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:29):**  are on linking some of the conversation that just happened about animal welfare and better  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:34):**  animal health outcomes, linking back to the productivity of those animals and hopefully  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:40):**  resulting in fewer natural resources required to produce a given amount of animal protein.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:46):**  Even in the developed world and definitely in the developing world, we still have lots  
**[0:29:49-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:49):**  of challenges with mortalities of livestock and poultry species, right? And so anytime  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:29:55):**  that we can reduce illness, reduce mortalities that, you know, quite frankly, shouldn't be  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:01):**  happening, right? Because of disease, because of heat stress or whatever it may be, that's  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:05):**  hopefully a positive where we're moving both the wellbeing of these animals and environmental  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:11):**  outcomes in the same direction. And sometimes that doesn't always happen with sustainability.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:16):**  There are definitely trade-offs, but I think that's one of those bright spots where, you  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:20):**  know, hopefully we can improve the quality of life of animals, reduce mortality and improve  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:25):**  the environmental effects of the system. And so metrics are actually really important  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:29):**  within that conversation. And, and Oystein, I wonder if you might want to come in on that  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:34):**  because you know, metrics, it seems to me, getting the right measures in place and, and  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:39):**  then using those to help farmers monitor the success of interventions or changes they're  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:44):**  making in their system, success or failure of those so that they can then further modify  
**[0:30:48-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:48):**  what they're doing. But then also using those metrics somehow to communicate better with  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:54):**  customers because of course, you know, in the old days, whenever the old days was, a  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:30:59):**  customer could go and buy direct from a farmer and have a conversation. Whereas now, you  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:03):**  know, the retailer is, is sort of there, the food supply system is, is there and kind of  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:08):**  in the way of that conversation for the vast majority of people. And that communication  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:13):**  between farmer and customer is very limited. So metrics and labelling the way that food  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:18):**  is promoted becomes really critical to telling that story.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:23):**  Yes, both, both the communication side, but also the, the, you know, the, on the supply  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:28):**  chain, the, the, the management side of things. So a lot of the work that we do at FAI is  
**[0:31:33-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:33):**  around essentially expanding that toolbox of, of KPIs, right? Like key, key indicators  
**[0:31:39-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:39):**  that a farmer or a supply chain manager can look at in order to, to measure the, the performance  
**[0:31:46-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:46):**  of, of that supply chain. And it's critical for us to try and come up with objective measures  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:52):**  that help us on a, on a, on a day to day or a crop by crop basis, really measure what  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:31:58):**  is the experience of the animals that are going through, going through this particular  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:02):**  system. And it doesn't matter which system it is, the, you know, the measures are often,  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:06):**  are often the same and they are as, as Sarah says, you know, they can be things like mortality,  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:11):**  particular diseases that are, that are prevalent in different, in different species. They can  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:17):**  also be things that have to do with their, you know, their ability to express, express  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:23):**  natural, natural behaviors. So you get this sort of combination, I guess, of, of real  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:29):**  outcome measures, the things that we can look at an animal either in the barn or on the  
**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:34):**  field or at, even at the slaughterhouse to sort of see is, has this animal had a, had  
**[0:32:40-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:40):**  a good experience as well as measure consistently particular inputs and, and particular practices  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:47):**  that are done across the supply chain in order to add substance to that, to that communication  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:52):**  and add sort of evidence to do why, why could, why should you support, you know, support  
**[0:32:58-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:32:58):**  this type of production system? And the same obviously then goes to, to those wider environmental  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:05):**  outcomes and I think that is where, you know, that is the next frontier in, in some ways  
**[0:33:09-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:09):**  is for when food production or when food producers can really evidence that their practices are  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:17):**  having positive outcomes on the things that we all agree that we need, you know, for the  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:22):**  survival of our own species. So I'm talking about documenting enhanced biodiversity on  
**[0:33:28-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:28):**  your, you know, on your farm and in your field, improved soil health quality, water filtration  
**[0:33:35-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:35):**  in the soil, pre-forestation, carbon sequestration, you know, the minute you have evidence from  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:41):**  the, from the farm level to say that the production of, of these, you know, food products also  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:46):**  came with the production of these amazing outcomes. I think that's when we can shift  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:51):**  the debate and, and sort of make some, you know, make some real progress.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:55):**  And communicating that to people, you know, that, that is, that is a challenge and Sarah,  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:33:59):**  I just, to flex, I'm going to come to you at the end of this, this question to see if  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:03):**  you have thoughts, but, but it seems to me just in, in sort of trying to bring us together,  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:08):**  bring it, you know, draw us to a close on the conversation that we've started talking  
**[0:34:12-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:12):**  about less and we've concluded that less isn't necessarily a helpful framing. But that better,  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:18):**  better can be helpful, particularly if it focuses on the economics as well and recognises  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:24):**  that farmers have families and farmers want to feel good about what they're doing. But  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:28):**  then if we're using metrics to help with management and to assist with that future communication  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:33):**  with customers. But at the same time, you know, if I go into a supermarket now and I  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:37):**  want to buy sustainable, then, you know, I'm not sure that I can, because everything that  
**[0:34:43-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:43):**  I'm looking at, whether it's you know, an organic mango that shrink wrapped and you  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:49):**  know, sent around the world, or whether it's it's a piece of local beef that was produced  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:54):**  perhaps from a farm that wasn't as good as another, you know, there were challenges and  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:34:58):**  it's very difficult to sort of work my way through that as a, as a customer. And I wonder  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:03):**  if you have any thoughts, Sarah, about what we should be looking for, what people should  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:07):**  be looking for out there. And if you're not sure whether you have thoughts about the kind  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:11):**  of systems that could be introduced in order that we have better information in the future.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:16):**  Yeah, I think what was just said about metrics is spot on, right? So all these conversations,  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:23):**  a lot of the reason that we kind of have these circuitous conversations about these things  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:27):**  is because we don't have good measures that are outcome based, that we can actually track  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:32):**  some of these things over time. And so really, it's maybe not as thrilling of an answer,  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:38):**  but I really think it is about putting those systems in place where our producers can measure  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:42):**  some of the positives and the negatives, if you will, so they can track it over time and  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:46):**  better measure it. And I think I think when folks can actually have those measures, they  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:51):**  will manage differently to change those outcomes. We definitely see that in other aspects of  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:35:56):**  agriculture, right. But if we don't have those good metrics, it's very hard for us to make  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:02):**  progress in that area. And I think whether that is soil carbon or these other ecosystem  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:07):**  services that were talked about, right, whether it's water filtration or whatever it may be,  
**[0:36:12-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:12):**  that is super important. As is I know you guys have been talking a lot about this GWP  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:17):**  star metric, which is great in terms of better linking methane emissions, whether it's from  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:24):**  the ruminants of ruminant animals or from manure, better to warming. But also if we're  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:29):**  going to use that metric, we need good time series data on methane. And we really are  
**[0:36:35-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:35):**  lacking that currently at the farm level. And so I think to answer your question, you  
**[0:36:40-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:40):**  know, maybe we don't have those systems in place where somebody could scan a, you know,  
**[0:36:44-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:44):**  a QR code and know that currently. But if we get those metrics in place and we have  
**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:50):**  broad agreement and set goals based on them, I think we're going to see a lot more rapid  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:36:55):**  change. But it's the lack of those deployable metrics at the farm level that's really holding  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:00):**  us back from getting to the next level at the moment.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:03):**  So it sounds to me like there is there's a real need to to find and I know that there  
**[0:37:07-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:07):**  are different organisations looking at this from FAI, for example, at a global level,  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:12):**  working with the with the companies and corporates they work with. And, you know, in the UK,  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:17):**  groups like the Sustainable Food Trust, who are working on what those metrics are looking  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:22):**  at them in the UK. But then, you know, looking at how those can be sort of broadened out  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:26):**  to to to work in systems around the world, getting those metrics in place so that people  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:31):**  can start to start to trust their food, perhaps more than they do currently in terms of that  
**[0:37:38-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:38):**  sustainability aspect. But perhaps in in conclusion, rather than thinking in terms of less and  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:44):**  better and, you know, taking Oyston's point that we can focus on on better more, perhaps  
**[0:37:49-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:49):**  there are different phrases that we can we can think of. And the one that keeps sort  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:52):**  of coming back to my mind is one which is associated with regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:37:57):**  you know, sort of four pillars of regenerative agriculture. And one of them is complexity,  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:02):**  you know, complexity of the sword, complexity in nature. And it seems to me that complexity  
**[0:38:06-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:06):**  or diversity in our own diets is one of the things that we can all do that, you know,  
**[0:38:13-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:13):**  I know I eat a lot of toast, you know, frankly, and, you know, so that's a lot of bread. I  
**[0:38:18-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:18):**  could improve my health, I can improve the sustainability footprint of my diet by broadening  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:25):**  the variety of foods that I use. But when we're talking about diversity, we should be  
**[0:38:29-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:29):**  thinking about farm type. So the scale of the production system, and the type of food  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:36):**  that's produced in the fields and the outcomes, the environmental outcomes that are being  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:40):**  delivered as well, that diversity is something complexity, you know, over the years, we've  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:45):**  been simplifying, ever simplifying the food system in different places, trying to, you  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:50):**  know, grow this one thing really, really well in this one place. But actually, if we add  
**[0:38:56-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:38:56):**  more complexity, reintroduce a bit of diversity, then perhaps we'll start delivering some of  
**[0:39:02-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:02):**  the outcomes that we're talking about.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:04):**  Yeah, I think that's key is that, you know, to your point, it's sometimes the way we frame  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:09):**  things is just completely wrong. And I think whether it's saying it's, you know, it's either  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:13):**  plant based or animal based agriculture, that's really at the end of the day, kind of silly,  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:18):**  right? Because it's about both and it's about how they fit together. And to your point,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:22):**  you know, that's where livestock are very valuable in agricultural systems is, you know,  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:27):**  that nutrient cycling, that upcycling ability that they have, that's really key. And so  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:32):**  that's very important. And then on the consumer side, honestly, I always, I hesitate giving  
**[0:39:38-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:38):**  anybody any dietary advice. It's like, you know, you do you and I hope you eat enough.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:42):**  That's pretty much how I feel about it of I don't want us to dictate people's diets  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:50):**  on some of these issues. When we just highlighted, we have such challenges and really linking  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:39:55):**  production practices to a given item on a shelf. And so that's probably an unsatisfactory  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:00):**  answer. But I just I just really believe strongly that we don't want to turn this into a food  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:04):**  shaming exercise that people should first and foremost, take care of yourself and and  
**[0:40:09-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:09):**  hopefully enjoy your food because at the end of the day, it's food.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:12):**  I mean, I think what I'm taking from what I'm taking for what you've just said there,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:16):**  Sarah is that look, it's it's, you know, it's down to individuals what they eat. But actually,  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:21):**  there are so many other different aspects, different parts of the food system, the food  
**[0:40:25-0:40:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:25):**  supply chain, you know, where, where these changes also need to be made. And so telling  
**[0:40:31-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:31):**  people what to eat or rewarding people or for being vegan or telling people off reading  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:36):**  too much meat is it's beside the point, really, it's about making sure fundamentally that  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:41):**  the food systems that we have, the food production that we have is sustainable so that we can  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:45):**  go on producing food so that people continue having choice, you know, for the decades and  
**[0:40:50-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:50):**  the centuries to come. Absolutely. And that's that's very key. And  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:53):**  I want to say, you know, like if somebody chooses to be vegan, they shouldn't be vilified  
**[0:40:57-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:40:57):**  either. Right. Like that cuts across everything. That's that's absolutely right.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:00):**  I totally agree. And I think there is, you know, at the moment, there is quite a lot  
**[0:41:04-0:41:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:04):**  of sort of food anxiety, I would say. And and the sort of flip side of that, for me,  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:10):**  is that maybe, you know, less and better. Is it essentially the same as sort of everything  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:14):**  in moderation or, you know, a varied diet or a balanced plate? You know, we've had you  
**[0:41:20-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:20):**  know, we've had we've had many sort of versions of that type of mantra. And and perhaps it's  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:27):**  for me, it's it's, you know, the same way as as nature blossoms with with biodiversity.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:33):**  I think our health and production systems blossoms when, you know, when there is diversity  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:37):**  and when we, you know, when we sort of eat diversity, so to speak.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:42):**  So we spend 40 or 50 minutes answering a question that we kind of think might be a bit silly,  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:47):**  even to be focusing on in the first place. And, you know, we need to find more ways of  
**[0:41:52-0:41:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:52):**  doing better across the whole food chain. And perhaps we need to find better framing,  
**[0:41:58-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:41:58):**  different framing that is that is appealing to more people, which engages producers in  
**[0:42:03-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:42:03):**  the same way that it mobilises customers. So if anybody has suggestions, then answers  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-Less--Better-mean-ebr9a0#t=0:42:10):**  on a postcard or on Twitter, at least, please. So I'm going to draw it to an end. Thank you

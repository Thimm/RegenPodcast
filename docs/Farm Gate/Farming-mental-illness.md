**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Castayne and in this programme I'm talking to Graham  Morgan about farming, mental health and mental illness. Graham works for the Mental Health  Commission for Scotland and volunteers with Hug Action for Mental Health. He was awarded  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:21):**  an MBE for services to mental health and has spoken about mental illness to the United  Nations. He's also written a book, Start, which reviewers describe in glowing terms.  He recently talked to a conference organised by the National Farmers Union of Scotland.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:36):**  Well, the conference I spoke at with the National Farmers Union was all about raising awareness  of the fact that farmers and people working on farms can experience mental health problems  and have a right to get help for it. And I spoke about some fairly basic things really.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:52):**  I talked about my own experience of mental illness and my impressions of some of the  difficulties farmers might experience in their working lives, which may lead to distress  or mental health problems, and how that's not something anyone should feel ashamed of  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:10):**  and how people have a right to get help. And that might be very, very easy help, like just  talking to a friend, or it might be getting more formal help from mental health services.  Almost one of the first things that you said to me was that you talked about your own experiences  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:25):**  of mental illness and your own mental health issues. And it seems to me that that's one  of the reasons that you're very successful at opening mental health conversations, because  you are very honest. It seems that your voice is quite unique.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:37):**  Oh, I think there are more and more people speaking out about their experience of mental  health and mental illness. I don't think there are so many people with my experience because  I have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and I'm treated against my will. I think that's a  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:50):**  fairly rare voice, but more and more people are speaking out. I'm lucky in that I've always,  nearly always had a very, very positive reaction from people I speak to about my experiences.  Now in this, in the speech that you, that you did for NFUS, you talked about labels  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:07):**  and you talked about stereotypes. And I just wonder if you could talk to me about the value  of stereotypes because, you know, we need them as shorthand, don't we? Stereotypes are  helpful, but they're also, they create barriers to better understanding, a deeper understanding  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:22):**  about people and their experiences. Oh yes, I totally agree with you. The stereotypes  we create, we do need them in the same way that we label things. It helps us make sense  of things. But I think the most important thing is to recognize we're all individuals  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:35):**  and just, and that although a stereotype can help us understand each other, it can also  obscure who we are and obscure our individuality and our own personal needs.  And you talked about masks as well. You know, not, not only, you know, there's a degree  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:49):**  to which we stereotype ourselves that we, we make assumptions about the way that we  need to present ourselves. But there are times when you just, you get fed up with wearing  that mask and you just want to be able to take it off, but it becomes really difficult  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:05):**  because the longer you've worn it, the more it's welded to your face. And so how can people  start to remove that mask when they've been wearing it for a long time?  Oh, I wish I knew. I wish I knew. I constantly wear a mask that sometimes that you need to  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:21):**  present an acceptable face to other people. The way, the places where I find I can be  myself, if you like, to take that mask off is around people who I trust and feel I belong  to. And often that's in my case, it's the community of people who've experienced mental  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:38):**  health problems. So if I go to a drop-in center or somewhere like that, I often feel I can  just relax and be myself and not worry about who I am. And I think I noticed that to an  extent when I was at the NFU farmers meeting up in, in Veruri, where after the, all the  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:55):**  speeches where farmers themselves talked about having mental health problems, I spoke with  many farmers who had experienced mental illness and it was almost a palpable sense of relief  after that meeting began to wind down when people realized they could be open about their  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:09):**  own experiences to each other and not only open about having mental illness, but also  recognizing that the people that were speaking to understood what it was like to be a farmer  and to live in a rural area and experience mental health problems. And that was, that  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:23):**  was very, a very lovely thing to see. And I was very privileged to hear some of the  stories of some of the farmers and what they've gone through.  How did that work? You know, after you said after the event, was it the, um, that you  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:34):**  kind of waited a little while kind of wondering what would happen and then somebody came up,  came up and started talking in that sort of open the flood gates and, and, and there was  a sort of cascade of other stories or did people just feel generally, um, able having  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:48):**  heard what you had to say and what other people had to say to come up and, and have some of  those conversations?  I know it was much more, I was really impressed by the NFU Scotland. What they had done is  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:58):**  they got me to speak of my experiences, but they also got, I think two or three other  farmers to speak publicly about being a farmer and a successful farmer, but also experiencing  mental illness. And that was really, really good. Then we had questions where many farmers  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:13):**  and members of the farming community spoke about their experience and quizzed us on our  experiences. But the most important part of that whole event was afterwards where we were  encouraged to mix and mingle, to have coffee, to eat sandwiches and just talk to each other.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:29):**  And in my case, I had my book there, so I was there and people just came up to me and  we sat down and had lots and lots of lovely conversations. In fact, there's the socializing  and talking to each other about our own experiences probably took more of the meeting than the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:42):**  actual speeches and questions part of it.  And presumably, you know, from that perspective was more helpful for a lot of the people there.  Yes, it was. And I think the idea was to get farmers to join up and build networks. So  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:57):**  in that part of Scotland, they could provide direct support to each other because after  all, they know what they're going through and they know their communities. So they're  in a very good position to provide that first link between each other when you're experiencing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:12):**  a problem.  It's interesting because, you know, obviously farmers, you know, by definition of what they  do live relatively remotely from other people. But it's always struck me that farmers are  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:26):**  extremely good at building networks, but traditionally perhaps those networks haven't been about  wellness or mental health or any of these other sort of phrases. And so do you get the  impression that more of these networks are emerging as people realize that mental health  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:45):**  can be a challenge for farmers just as it can be for other people?  I hope so. Certainly in Scotland, we have something called the Rural Mental Health Forum,  which links up lots of farming communities and rural communities and mental health organizations  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:57):**  across Scotland and up in the northeast of Scotland, the NFU Scotland workers there have  been establishing networks for a long, long time and doing a lot of groundwork. And the  meeting I spoke at was the first meeting that was held about mental health, but there were  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:11):**  at least well over a hundred people from the farming community at the meeting.  Why do you think those people had come? Why had those farmers come? Was it because they  already felt that they were experiencing mental health issues or just because they were interested  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:25):**  in the topic?  I think both. I think they were interested in it. I think there had been a lot of preparation  work for people to understand about it. So for instance, one of the farmers there had  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:35):**  been on local television on numerous occasions talking about his own mental health problems,  and that was getting word out to the farming community. And there had also been some research  projects around mental health and the farming community in that area. So people were aware  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:50):**  of it as an issue. And then it was just, to be honest, it was marketed and advertised  really well. And it seemed to be a topic that struck home to a lot of people. And certainly  a lot of the farmers I was speaking to were talking about the incredible pressure they  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:04):**  can be under doing their jobs and sometimes the utter isolation they can be experiencing  too, where it becomes so lonely and can of course lead to quite considerable distress.  I want to come onto that in just a minute, but before we do, I think actually we probably  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:20):**  ought to take a step back and look at some of these labels. I mean, what do we mean?  You know, we talk about mental health. What do we mean by that?  I was dreading you asking me that because I think that's something that academics are  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:31):**  trying, have been trying for years and years to answer. And I don't know because I'm not  an academic and I'm not an expert.  Does it matter in that case?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:39):**  I think I would more, I more refer to mental illness. So I think that some of the conditions  that people will be familiar with, such as depression and anxiety for which you can get  help, like your medication and so on. And some of the other experiences of mental illness,  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:55):**  which are maybe more dramatic, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or birth, personality  disorder. There's a whole range of mental illnesses where generally it's characterised  by a degree of distress and a lack of ability to carry on with life in the way we would  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:11):**  like to. And then of course, there's wellbeing and mental health, which is something we all  have and I think are probably all striving to increase and improve on.  One of the stereotypes of farmers that I grew up with is that they are the stoical kind  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:26):**  of people who will get their hand pulled off in a, in a, in a, in a combine harvester and  still carry on working until sunset. And so the idea that, that farmers en masse are going  to identify their mental illness and take time to go to the doctors or to speak to somebody  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:46):**  because they're feeling sad or think that they're feeling a bit depressed, but they  haven't really kind of identified it as being more than that. Seems, seems quite a challenge.  How do we, do you think that farmers are doing that? And if they're not, how do we, how do  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:00):**  we persuade people to take their mental health more seriously and to identify when they need  to ask for help more?  I think there may be some element of truth in your characterisation of some farmers.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:15):**  From my point of view, it's trying to recognise that mental illness is just as much an illness  as that hand knocked off in the combine and that you have a right to help and that without  getting help, life will be difficult and that the help can transform lives. And that help  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:31):**  may be medication, it may be talking treatments. It may be just finding someone who you can  unload to and talk about in a, in an open manner. I, I, I can't really find an answer  because it's such a difficult thing.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:46):**  I sort of approach it from a slightly different direction. If, in, in your experience over  the last sort of 10, 20 years, have I suppose that perhaps people feel that if they go to  the doctors because they're feeling isolated or lonely or unhappy or, or, or any of these  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:03):**  other things that we kind of generally associate with, you know, with perhaps with early onset  mental illness, then they might be seen as, as weak. They, they might be laughed at. In  your experience, does this ever happen?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:18):**  It's, it's never happened to me, which is the best way of answering it. When I first  went to see a doctor, I, it would have been about three decades ago, longer than that,  when I was in my early twenties and I was absolutely terrified. I remember walking up  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:33):**  and down out of the surgery, really, really, really frightened. And the wonderful thing  was that people in the surgery had seen me and seen my distress. So when I walked through  the door, they just pointed me straight upstairs to see a doctor. Now I think that's not,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:47):**  an unusual thing to happen, but any doctor or health professional is expected to treat  mental illness seriously and give people respect when they come to them for help. Unfortunately,  sometimes the services aren't there when we need them. And sometimes there are still some  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:05):**  poor attitudes. I think that's why there's so much stigma around mental illness. So to  say, if you go to get help for your mental health, you will inevitably get all the help  you need and everything will be good again. And everyone will be nice to you, will be  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:18):**  to maybe paint a sort of Rose garden picture of it. But the other side to it is without  getting the help, things can get very, very difficult indeed. And certainly in my experience,  people have been wonderful to me, nearly all the time, maybe sort of 37 years ago, when  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:33):**  I was in one of the old asylums, you could see some attitudes which were frankly quite  horrendous. But nowadays when I get help, it has been really, sometimes I hear of help  that is not so good, but that's how the world works.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:47):**  And I suppose, you know, the part of the challenge is, is taking that, that, that personal conception  about one's own mental health. You know, if it was me, and I was concerned about that,  it's, it's, it's about taking that sense that I can't cope, and this is a bad thing, it's  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:08):**  changing that, transforming that so that it's, it's actually a sign of strength that you're  able to step forward, step up and go to the doctors and admit that there's something that  you, that you need some help from outside about.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:21):**  I think you're quite right on that. I think, I think certainly when I was speaking to farmers  who were being open about having sought help and how that had really, really helped them,  it was, it was a lovely feeling because they just felt so, seemed so strong and so confident  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:36):**  and so glad that they'd turned that corner. When before it seemed that they were very  only lonely and, and were suffering a huge amount of guilt because they were trying to  cope on their own and didn't really feel they had the right to help when of course everyone  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:48):**  does because it's an illness like anything else.  Now there's, there's a phrase that, that I keep coming across in the last couple of years,  and maybe you've been using it for a long time in, in mental health circles, but this  
**[0:14:00-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:00):**  idea of wellness and wellbeing. And, and to me that, that seems that it's centered in  people trying to be good to themselves, to be kind to themselves so that they are better  able to cope and less likely to, to fall into traits around depression and sadness and,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:21):**  and to, and to feel overcome by the isolation that they might feel. Is that a reasonable  characterisation? Is that what that is and what can farmers do to boost their own wellbeing?  From my point of view, that's exactly what it's about. I think, I'm not sure what farmers  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:34):**  can do because I think it's an individual thing for everyone, but I can maybe talk about  my own experience and my partner Wendy's experience. In the last, last year, both of our fathers  died and it was a long and slow process for one of them and extremely stressful for us  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:53):**  as a family. And we promised ourselves through, throughout that process to find things we  could enjoy, not to be so hard on ourselves that we thought we had to solve everything.  And for me, that was a huge blessing because there's so much pressure at those times and  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:08):**  just being able to, for me to go walking with the dog, listening to the oyster catchers  and the curlews and the seagulls, that was lovely. That was such a piece of peace, but  equally going swimming or taking some time off work. I think that's harder for farmers  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:22):**  to get time off, but sometimes time for yourself and time for each other. If you're a couple  or a family where you can actually celebrate each other and make sure that each other is  having, having some, some enjoyment in life, because sometimes it can just get so pressured  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:36):**  that you forget that actually a lot of life is about trying to, to be kind to each other,  to look after each other, to celebrate some of the small things about life.  For some time I lived on the Isle of Man and was General Secretary of the NFU there. And  
**[0:16:00-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:00):**  obviously there were people who, um, who put themselves outside that community, but there  were people who put themselves outside that community, but there were people who put themselves  outside that community, but there weren't people who put themselves outside the community,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:45):**  but there weren't, um, but nobody out there wanted to join their family.  But so I remember doing a pregnancy expanded him all the time in 228 vile. And then you  And there've been some very lovely things where I hear through my partner that maybe  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:05):**  one of the mums has had a really hard time, maybe had an operation or something, and how  members of the community will look out for her, make sure the children are looked after,  make sure there are meals and things like that.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:16):**  And I think I've seen that wherever I've lived, it's been in some fairly rural parts of Scotland,  especially in the Highlands.  I haven't seen it so much with the farming community, because that's not my community,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:27):**  but I've seen it in the places I've been.  And I think it's absolutely wonderful.  I've also seen it the opposite way around, where sometimes I've withdrawn from people  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:36):**  and not known how to make links with other people.  And that can be a desperately lonely time and very, very hard to break out of.  Sometimes the thought of making new friends or going to new things produces a huge amount  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:51):**  of anxiety in me.  But I tend to find that when I am brave enough to reach out or to go somewhere, even if that  does involve some travel, that it does change things for the better.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:01):**  One of the things that I know that you have done much more of recently, you've got a dog,  and you've gone out and it's kind of forced you once or twice a day to go and have this  regular walk.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:15):**  Having the dog has totally transformed our life.  We got him mainly because we wanted to bring some lightness and joy into our lives around  the death of Wendy's dad.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:25):**  And he certainly did that.  Every time I take Dash for a walk, I go to somewhere called Walmart most times, and it  takes about 40 minutes.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:33):**  And you can start off the walk and the thoughts are racing in your head and you're maybe angry  about something or worried about something.  And by the time I'm halfway around the walk, I'm slowing down.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:43):**  I'm listening.  I'm feeling the wind on my face.  And like you say, I'm looking at the birds or maybe the seals if they're there, and the  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:50):**  trees and feeling the breeze and looking across the sea.  And it just feels wonderful.  It gives me some space.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:56):**  It gives me the chance to not have to concentrate on the day to day life, but to actually relax  a little bit.  And having the dog with me gives me exercise too.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:05):**  The exercise is wonderful.  I've managed to get myself incredibly unfit over the years.  And just getting out every day for a short walk really makes a huge difference to how  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:15):**  I feel in myself.  It's interesting because, you know, if I have an argument at home, then I find actually  that going for a walk can do the same thing.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:23):**  And actually, if I'm not feeling like going out and or it's pouring down with rain and  you know, the wind's blowing a gale, then actually just sitting down for that half hour  and watching a sitcom, you know, can be really helpful as well.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:37):**  Just sitting on the phone and doing that is it's something about that kind of taking 20  or 30 minutes.  It seems to need to be for me about that length of time that just lets me kind of release  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:49):**  some of those stresses that are going on in life to climb back down off my high horse,  if it's an argument, or just kind of take some of that space so that I can re-engage  with the challenges that I was having and be more successful.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:06):**  I think that's such a sensible point.  I think sometimes with the pressures of life nowadays, we can get ourselves incredibly  wound up and it can be really, really important just to take that space before it bursts out  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:18):**  of us in ways we don't want it to do.  And that can be in all sorts of fashions.  Like you say, for me, sometimes it's just writing.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:25):**  I love to write, for instance.  Other times it's what sounds silly, but just curling up in bed.  Sometimes I just need to do that because it's good.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:34):**  And other times it's finding a way of confining my vulnerability in someone I trust, which  tends to be my partner, Wendy.  It can take me ages to know that I'm upset and distressed and irritable.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:48):**  And Wendy is wonderful at saying to me, to just sit down and talk to her and to try to  work out why I'm not sleeping or why I'm sleeping all the time or why I'm drinking all the time.  And it is such a relief after you've sat down and suddenly you realise why you're so wound  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:05):**  up and can relax again.  And some of that irritability and that exhaustion just fades away.  We talked about farming being associated with lots of different mental illness and challenges  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:19):**  around that.  And part of the challenge is trying to help people to get intervention before it's too  late.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:27):**  And farmer suicides, officially, they're more than one a week in the UK, which is a staggering  number.  What kind of illnesses are they that you've come across within the farming sector?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:39):**  Why do you think that that mental illness is higher, the levels are higher than general  society within the farming community?  I would imagine some of the more serious mental illnesses which tend to have more of a genetic  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:53):**  component are just as common with farmers as other people.  But some of the experiences of depression and anxiety can be caused by the environment  you're in and how life is.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:04):**  And certainly from speaking to farmers, I'm aware that they can be under an incredible  amount of pressure.  Their job is a very, very tough one, one I certainly couldn't do.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:16):**  Finances can be really, really difficult.  The bureaucracy can be absolutely horrendous and that the future is difficult with all  the stuff that's happening with Brexit and so on.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:24):**  It must be very hard to know what the future is going to be like.  And that also they can be very, very isolated.  And sadly, in the case of suicide, the means to complete suicide are quite easy in rural  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:36):**  and farming communities.  I think that those are the sorts of reasons it may be so high amongst farmers.  And maybe there is perhaps still a remnant of that culture of saying, I just need to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:46):**  soldier on and carry on and cope and be strong when sometimes being strong is actually biting  off your nose because you're determined to show you're OK when in fact you're not.  You talked about issues that are happening at the moment.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:59):**  Clearly Brexit is first and foremost the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The fact that farm gate prices are very low.  And so an awful lot of farmers are heavily reliant on the support that they get from  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:13):**  taxpayers.  In that situation, I mean, clearly where the future is so uncertain, it must be very difficult  to be able to take hold of those lifelines that create some stability.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:29):**  And do you have any suggestions for people who, you know, their life, their economic  life is really very challenging because it is so uncertain at the moment out there in  the country.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:40):**  What are the things that people can do?  What are the tips that you can give them?  I think if I was a farmer, I could feel very, very worried about my future at the moment.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:50):**  And some things are just so difficult to cope with.  I think there are a number of farming organisations that provide support to farmers and a number  of helplines.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:00):**  Some of those are conventional mental health helplines, but some are specific to farmers.  And I suppose you'll be more aware, especially of the ones in England, because I don't know  about the English ones.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:10):**  But I know there are some levels of support in Scotland where farmers can get emotional  support, financial advice and that sort of thing.  And that is, I think, really helpful.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:21):**  I think also, even if it doesn't solve some of the complexities of life in an uncertain  future, being able to talk with each other is sometimes really, really helpful.  Sharing problems really can ease some of the burden sometimes, I think.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:38):**  It doesn't solve all the problems, but it makes it slightly less intense and lonely  when you can speak to another person and say, I'm absolutely terrified about what to do.  I don't need a bank or whatever.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:49):**  And someone can say, yes, I am too, or else say, yes, I had that problem, but I did something  to get out of it.  And that was this.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:56):**  And if people find it difficult to speak to people that they know to let to take off those  masks that we were talking about earlier, you know, if they associate themselves with  the person in the family who is strong, who is able to cope and they don't feel yet able  
**[0:25:11-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:11):**  to open up to a family member, then presumably, if we can point people to helplines, but it's  not quite so much of a step to speak to a stranger, or is it?  It varies.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:26):**  For some people, speaking to a stranger is absolutely terrifying.  And for other people, it provides a degree of security because they're not known by that  person.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:35):**  I think that's also quite difficult in rural areas because you do tend to be known by most  people, but I suppose if you're going, say, to the health services, then they do have  a imperative of confidentiality.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:48):**  So you can be sure that if you go to see a GP or a nurse or whoever, that they will listen  to you and they can't break confidentiality and tell other people what you're going through  and that it's for your health and with other health professionals.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:01):**  And maybe that will provide some security to farmers who are maybe reluctant to admit  that they're not coping, to know that the health service does have standards of conduct  which would respect what you're saying to them.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:13):**  Are there things that people can do, that the society can do, to help to break down  the stigma of mental illness?  And for me as an individual and as part of a community, a rural community, to start recognising  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:28):**  where some of these challenges lie and to help farmers who may not even know that they're  starting to fall into mental illness?  I think one thing that's very well known is that having contact with people who experience  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:40):**  mental illness is the best way of challenging stigma.  But I think as a community, for all of us, I think looking at difference and maybe celebrating  that rather than being suspicious of it is a really important thing.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:54):**  I think also recognising that mental illness is not separate and belonging to a strange  alien set of other people, that we all experience different degrees of wellbeing and mental  health.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:07):**  And some of us, many of us, will experience mental illness and that it's just a natural  part of life.  And I think sometimes I see communities, for instance, the Murray wellbeing hub, I love  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:17):**  that, where people are all saying we want to look at mental health and we want to look  at mental illness and we're going to look at creating community connections throughout  our community, whether we've experienced mental illness or not.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:29):**  But the main thing is that we're creating a sense of belonging, a sense of connection,  a sense of the fact that we can all in our different ways improve each other's mental  health by looking out for each other.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:40):**  And I wonder if one of the challenges is, you know, when I think about mental illness  and the idea of asking for help, that it somehow seems like it's going to become a label that's  going to be with you for life, that you'll always be somebody who needed help.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:54):**  And I guess it's about perhaps partly about sort of letting people know that we have different  phases in our lives that, you know, sometimes we'll feel poorly and go to the doctors, you  know, we've got flu or whatever, and sometimes we'll be finding life just mentally really  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:11):**  difficult.  But that doesn't mean that we're always going to find things really difficult and we can  get better in the same way that you cope with your own diagnosis.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:21):**  I think so, I think it's really important to recognise that within the spectrum of mental  illness that we have serious illnesses, less serious illnesses, lifelong illnesses and  temporary illnesses.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:33):**  So just as we can get a cold and be under the weather for a few days or get the flu  and be under the weather for a couple of weeks, so can we have experiences with our emotions  and our moods and our wellbeing that are difficult to cope with for a short period of time.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:46):**  And then other times those extend for longer, but usually most often we recover, get help  and face life again and it's just a blip in our lives that anyone can go through, like  you can go through any physical illness.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:58):**  And other people, for instance, people like me possibly do have lifelong illnesses for  which we will need support all our lives, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we  don't have good lives or we can't still contribute to the world we're a part of.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:12):**  That was Graham Morgan talking to me about farming and mental illness.  Graham's book Start can be found in bookshops and online, and it's a remarkably open, generous  and optimistic read.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:24):**  A farming life is generally a good life, but it's demanding and it can be stressful.  It's hardly a surprise that farmers and farm workers can feel isolated, depressed, and  sometimes just unable to cope.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:37):**  Mental illness is an illness, not a weakness, and it's a sign of strength to seek out the  help you need.  Importantly, mental illness can be treated, sometimes with support and sometimes with  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:49):**  medication.  If you're feeling isolated or depressed, or you think you know someone who is, help is  at hand and these are just a couple of the organisations that provide direct support  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:01):**  by phone and by email in the United Kingdom.  Farming Help is a UK-wide helpline which provides farmers in need with free, impartial and confidential  support every day of the year between 7am and 11pm.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:15):**  You can call them on 03000 111 999.  The Yana Project website has an excellent national directory of other numbers you can  call.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:25):**  Yana stands for You Are Not Alone.  Their website can be found at yanahhelp.org.  Farmgate isn't just a UK podcast, and I know that we have many listeners around the world.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:37):**  Unfortunately I can't list every helpline, but if you Google advice, farming and mental  illness followed by your country, then it's likely that you'll be able to find help too.  If you've enjoyed listening, please come back and listen to more, tell your friends, like

**[0:31:04-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:31:04):**  I've been Finn Loke Stane, bye for now.

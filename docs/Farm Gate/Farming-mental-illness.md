### Farm Gate  (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 15:27:48)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Castayne and in this programme I'm talking to Graham  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:11):**  Morgan about farming, mental health and mental illness. Graham works for the Mental Health  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:16):**  Commission for Scotland and volunteers with Hug Action for Mental Health. He was awarded  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:21):**  an MBE for services to mental health and has spoken about mental illness to the United  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:26):**  Nations. He's also written a book, Start, which reviewers describe in glowing terms.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:31):**  He recently talked to a conference organised by the National Farmers Union of Scotland.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:36):**  Well, the conference I spoke at with the National Farmers Union was all about raising awareness  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:42):**  of the fact that farmers and people working on farms can experience mental health problems  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:47):**  and have a right to get help for it. And I spoke about some fairly basic things really.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:52):**  I talked about my own experience of mental illness and my impressions of some of the  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:00:58):**  difficulties farmers might experience in their working lives, which may lead to distress  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:03):**  or mental health problems, and how that's not something anyone should feel ashamed of  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:10):**  and how people have a right to get help. And that might be very, very easy help, like just  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:14):**  talking to a friend, or it might be getting more formal help from mental health services.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:20):**  Almost one of the first things that you said to me was that you talked about your own experiences  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:25):**  of mental illness and your own mental health issues. And it seems to me that that's one  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:30):**  of the reasons that you're very successful at opening mental health conversations, because  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:33):**  you are very honest. It seems that your voice is quite unique.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:37):**  Oh, I think there are more and more people speaking out about their experience of mental  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:41):**  health and mental illness. I don't think there are so many people with my experience because  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:45):**  I have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and I'm treated against my will. I think that's a  
**[0:01:50-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:50):**  fairly rare voice, but more and more people are speaking out. I'm lucky in that I've always,  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:01:56):**  nearly always had a very, very positive reaction from people I speak to about my experiences.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:01):**  Now in this, in the speech that you, that you did for NFUS, you talked about labels  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:07):**  and you talked about stereotypes. And I just wonder if you could talk to me about the value  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:12):**  of stereotypes because, you know, we need them as shorthand, don't we? Stereotypes are  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:17):**  helpful, but they're also, they create barriers to better understanding, a deeper understanding  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:22):**  about people and their experiences. Oh yes, I totally agree with you. The stereotypes  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:26):**  we create, we do need them in the same way that we label things. It helps us make sense  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:30):**  of things. But I think the most important thing is to recognize we're all individuals  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:35):**  and just, and that although a stereotype can help us understand each other, it can also  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:39):**  obscure who we are and obscure our individuality and our own personal needs.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:44):**  And you talked about masks as well. You know, not, not only, you know, there's a degree  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:49):**  to which we stereotype ourselves that we, we make assumptions about the way that we  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:02:54):**  need to present ourselves. But there are times when you just, you get fed up with wearing  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:01):**  that mask and you just want to be able to take it off, but it becomes really difficult  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:05):**  because the longer you've worn it, the more it's welded to your face. And so how can people  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:11):**  start to remove that mask when they've been wearing it for a long time?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:15):**  Oh, I wish I knew. I wish I knew. I constantly wear a mask that sometimes that you need to  
**[0:03:21-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:21):**  present an acceptable face to other people. The way, the places where I find I can be  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:28):**  myself, if you like, to take that mask off is around people who I trust and feel I belong  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:33):**  to. And often that's in my case, it's the community of people who've experienced mental  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:38):**  health problems. So if I go to a drop-in center or somewhere like that, I often feel I can  
**[0:03:43-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:43):**  just relax and be myself and not worry about who I am. And I think I noticed that to an  
**[0:03:48-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:48):**  extent when I was at the NFU farmers meeting up in, in Veruri, where after the, all the  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:55):**  speeches where farmers themselves talked about having mental health problems, I spoke with  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:03:59):**  many farmers who had experienced mental illness and it was almost a palpable sense of relief  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:05):**  after that meeting began to wind down when people realized they could be open about their  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:09):**  own experiences to each other and not only open about having mental illness, but also  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:13):**  recognizing that the people that were speaking to understood what it was like to be a farmer  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:18):**  and to live in a rural area and experience mental health problems. And that was, that  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:23):**  was very, a very lovely thing to see. And I was very privileged to hear some of the  
**[0:04:27-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:27):**  stories of some of the farmers and what they've gone through.  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:29):**  How did that work? You know, after you said after the event, was it the, um, that you  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:34):**  kind of waited a little while kind of wondering what would happen and then somebody came up,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:39):**  came up and started talking in that sort of open the flood gates and, and, and there was  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:43):**  a sort of cascade of other stories or did people just feel generally, um, able having  
**[0:04:48-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:48):**  heard what you had to say and what other people had to say to come up and, and have some of  
**[0:04:52-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:52):**  those conversations?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:53):**  I know it was much more, I was really impressed by the NFU Scotland. What they had done is  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:04:58):**  they got me to speak of my experiences, but they also got, I think two or three other  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:03):**  farmers to speak publicly about being a farmer and a successful farmer, but also experiencing  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:08):**  mental illness. And that was really, really good. Then we had questions where many farmers  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:13):**  and members of the farming community spoke about their experience and quizzed us on our  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:18):**  experiences. But the most important part of that whole event was afterwards where we were  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:24):**  encouraged to mix and mingle, to have coffee, to eat sandwiches and just talk to each other.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:29):**  And in my case, I had my book there, so I was there and people just came up to me and  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:32):**  we sat down and had lots and lots of lovely conversations. In fact, there's the socializing  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:38):**  and talking to each other about our own experiences probably took more of the meeting than the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:42):**  actual speeches and questions part of it.  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:45):**  And presumably, you know, from that perspective was more helpful for a lot of the people there.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:51):**  Yes, it was. And I think the idea was to get farmers to join up and build networks. So  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:05:57):**  in that part of Scotland, they could provide direct support to each other because after  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:02):**  all, they know what they're going through and they know their communities. So they're  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:06):**  in a very good position to provide that first link between each other when you're experiencing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:12):**  a problem.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:13):**  It's interesting because, you know, obviously farmers, you know, by definition of what they  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:18):**  do live relatively remotely from other people. But it's always struck me that farmers are  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:26):**  extremely good at building networks, but traditionally perhaps those networks haven't been about  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:33):**  wellness or mental health or any of these other sort of phrases. And so do you get the  
**[0:06:38-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:38):**  impression that more of these networks are emerging as people realize that mental health  
**[0:06:45-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:45):**  can be a challenge for farmers just as it can be for other people?  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:48):**  I hope so. Certainly in Scotland, we have something called the Rural Mental Health Forum,  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:52):**  which links up lots of farming communities and rural communities and mental health organizations  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:06:57):**  across Scotland and up in the northeast of Scotland, the NFU Scotland workers there have  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:03):**  been establishing networks for a long, long time and doing a lot of groundwork. And the  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:07):**  meeting I spoke at was the first meeting that was held about mental health, but there were  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:11):**  at least well over a hundred people from the farming community at the meeting.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:17):**  Why do you think those people had come? Why had those farmers come? Was it because they  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:21):**  already felt that they were experiencing mental health issues or just because they were interested  
**[0:07:25-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:25):**  in the topic?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:26):**  I think both. I think they were interested in it. I think there had been a lot of preparation  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:30):**  work for people to understand about it. So for instance, one of the farmers there had  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:35):**  been on local television on numerous occasions talking about his own mental health problems,  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:40):**  and that was getting word out to the farming community. And there had also been some research  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:45):**  projects around mental health and the farming community in that area. So people were aware  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:50):**  of it as an issue. And then it was just, to be honest, it was marketed and advertised  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:07:54):**  really well. And it seemed to be a topic that struck home to a lot of people. And certainly  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:00):**  a lot of the farmers I was speaking to were talking about the incredible pressure they  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:04):**  can be under doing their jobs and sometimes the utter isolation they can be experiencing  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:10):**  too, where it becomes so lonely and can of course lead to quite considerable distress.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:16):**  I want to come onto that in just a minute, but before we do, I think actually we probably  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:20):**  ought to take a step back and look at some of these labels. I mean, what do we mean?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:25):**  You know, we talk about mental health. What do we mean by that?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:28):**  I was dreading you asking me that because I think that's something that academics are  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:31):**  trying, have been trying for years and years to answer. And I don't know because I'm not  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:35):**  an academic and I'm not an expert.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:37):**  Does it matter in that case?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:39):**  I think I would more, I more refer to mental illness. So I think that some of the conditions  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:46):**  that people will be familiar with, such as depression and anxiety for which you can get  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:50):**  help, like your medication and so on. And some of the other experiences of mental illness,  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:08:55):**  which are maybe more dramatic, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or birth, personality  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:01):**  disorder. There's a whole range of mental illnesses where generally it's characterised  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:06):**  by a degree of distress and a lack of ability to carry on with life in the way we would  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:11):**  like to. And then of course, there's wellbeing and mental health, which is something we all  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:15):**  have and I think are probably all striving to increase and improve on.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:19):**  One of the stereotypes of farmers that I grew up with is that they are the stoical kind  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:26):**  of people who will get their hand pulled off in a, in a, in a, in a combine harvester and  
**[0:09:32-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:32):**  still carry on working until sunset. And so the idea that, that farmers en masse are going  
**[0:09:40-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:40):**  to identify their mental illness and take time to go to the doctors or to speak to somebody  
**[0:09:46-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:46):**  because they're feeling sad or think that they're feeling a bit depressed, but they  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:50):**  haven't really kind of identified it as being more than that. Seems, seems quite a challenge.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:09:55):**  How do we, do you think that farmers are doing that? And if they're not, how do we, how do  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:00):**  we persuade people to take their mental health more seriously and to identify when they need  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:07):**  to ask for help more?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:08):**  I think there may be some element of truth in your characterisation of some farmers.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:15):**  From my point of view, it's trying to recognise that mental illness is just as much an illness  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:21):**  as that hand knocked off in the combine and that you have a right to help and that without  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:25):**  getting help, life will be difficult and that the help can transform lives. And that help  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:31):**  may be medication, it may be talking treatments. It may be just finding someone who you can  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:36):**  unload to and talk about in a, in an open manner. I, I, I can't really find an answer  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:43):**  because it's such a difficult thing.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:46):**  I sort of approach it from a slightly different direction. If, in, in your experience over  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:51):**  the last sort of 10, 20 years, have I suppose that perhaps people feel that if they go to  
**[0:10:57-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:10:57):**  the doctors because they're feeling isolated or lonely or unhappy or, or, or any of these  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:03):**  other things that we kind of generally associate with, you know, with perhaps with early onset  
**[0:11:08-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:08):**  mental illness, then they might be seen as, as weak. They, they might be laughed at. In  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:15):**  your experience, does this ever happen?  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:18):**  It's, it's never happened to me, which is the best way of answering it. When I first  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:23):**  went to see a doctor, I, it would have been about three decades ago, longer than that,  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:28):**  when I was in my early twenties and I was absolutely terrified. I remember walking up  
**[0:11:33-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:33):**  and down out of the surgery, really, really, really frightened. And the wonderful thing  
**[0:11:39-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:39):**  was that people in the surgery had seen me and seen my distress. So when I walked through  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:44):**  the door, they just pointed me straight upstairs to see a doctor. Now I think that's not,  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:47):**  an unusual thing to happen, but any doctor or health professional is expected to treat  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:11:54):**  mental illness seriously and give people respect when they come to them for help. Unfortunately,  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:00):**  sometimes the services aren't there when we need them. And sometimes there are still some  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:05):**  poor attitudes. I think that's why there's so much stigma around mental illness. So to  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:09):**  say, if you go to get help for your mental health, you will inevitably get all the help  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:13):**  you need and everything will be good again. And everyone will be nice to you, will be  
**[0:12:18-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:18):**  to maybe paint a sort of Rose garden picture of it. But the other side to it is without  
**[0:12:22-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:22):**  getting the help, things can get very, very difficult indeed. And certainly in my experience,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:28):**  people have been wonderful to me, nearly all the time, maybe sort of 37 years ago, when  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:33):**  I was in one of the old asylums, you could see some attitudes which were frankly quite  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:37):**  horrendous. But nowadays when I get help, it has been really, sometimes I hear of help  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:42):**  that is not so good, but that's how the world works.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:47):**  And I suppose, you know, the part of the challenge is, is taking that, that, that personal conception  
**[0:12:54-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:12:54):**  about one's own mental health. You know, if it was me, and I was concerned about that,  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:02):**  it's, it's, it's about taking that sense that I can't cope, and this is a bad thing, it's  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:08):**  changing that, transforming that so that it's, it's actually a sign of strength that you're  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:13):**  able to step forward, step up and go to the doctors and admit that there's something that  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:19):**  you, that you need some help from outside about.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:21):**  I think you're quite right on that. I think, I think certainly when I was speaking to farmers  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:25):**  who were being open about having sought help and how that had really, really helped them,  
**[0:13:30-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:30):**  it was, it was a lovely feeling because they just felt so, seemed so strong and so confident  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:36):**  and so glad that they'd turned that corner. When before it seemed that they were very  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:40):**  only lonely and, and were suffering a huge amount of guilt because they were trying to  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:44):**  cope on their own and didn't really feel they had the right to help when of course everyone  
**[0:13:48-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:48):**  does because it's an illness like anything else.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:50):**  Now there's, there's a phrase that, that I keep coming across in the last couple of years,  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:13:55):**  and maybe you've been using it for a long time in, in mental health circles, but this  
**[0:14:00-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:00):**  idea of wellness and wellbeing. And, and to me that, that seems that it's centered in  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:08):**  people trying to be good to themselves, to be kind to themselves so that they are better  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:14):**  able to cope and less likely to, to fall into traits around depression and sadness and,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:21):**  and to, and to feel overcome by the isolation that they might feel. Is that a reasonable  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:25):**  characterisation? Is that what that is and what can farmers do to boost their own wellbeing?  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:30):**  From my point of view, that's exactly what it's about. I think, I'm not sure what farmers  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:34):**  can do because I think it's an individual thing for everyone, but I can maybe talk about  
**[0:14:40-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:40):**  my own experience and my partner Wendy's experience. In the last, last year, both of our fathers  
**[0:14:47-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:47):**  died and it was a long and slow process for one of them and extremely stressful for us  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:53):**  as a family. And we promised ourselves through, throughout that process to find things we  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:14:58):**  could enjoy, not to be so hard on ourselves that we thought we had to solve everything.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:03):**  And for me, that was a huge blessing because there's so much pressure at those times and  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:08):**  just being able to, for me to go walking with the dog, listening to the oyster catchers  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:13):**  and the curlews and the seagulls, that was lovely. That was such a piece of peace, but  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:17):**  equally going swimming or taking some time off work. I think that's harder for farmers  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:22):**  to get time off, but sometimes time for yourself and time for each other. If you're a couple  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:27):**  or a family where you can actually celebrate each other and make sure that each other is  
**[0:15:31-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:31):**  having, having some, some enjoyment in life, because sometimes it can just get so pressured  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:36):**  that you forget that actually a lot of life is about trying to, to be kind to each other,  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:41):**  to look after each other, to celebrate some of the small things about life.  
**[0:15:45-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:15:45):**  For some time I lived on the Isle of Man and was General Secretary of the NFU there. And  
**[0:16:00-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:00):**  obviously there were people who, um, who put themselves outside that community, but there  
**[0:16:15-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:15):**  were people who put themselves outside that community, but there were people who put themselves  
**[0:16:31-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:31):**  outside that community, but there weren't people who put themselves outside the community,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:45):**  but there weren't, um, but nobody out there wanted to join their family.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:47):**  But so I remember doing a pregnancy expanded him all the time in 228 vile. And then you  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:16:59):**  And there've been some very lovely things where I hear through my partner that maybe  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:05):**  one of the mums has had a really hard time, maybe had an operation or something, and how  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:09):**  members of the community will look out for her, make sure the children are looked after,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:14):**  make sure there are meals and things like that.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:16):**  And I think I've seen that wherever I've lived, it's been in some fairly rural parts of Scotland,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:22):**  especially in the Highlands.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:23):**  I haven't seen it so much with the farming community, because that's not my community,  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:27):**  but I've seen it in the places I've been.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:29):**  And I think it's absolutely wonderful.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:31):**  I've also seen it the opposite way around, where sometimes I've withdrawn from people  
**[0:17:36-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:36):**  and not known how to make links with other people.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:39):**  And that can be a desperately lonely time and very, very hard to break out of.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:46):**  Sometimes the thought of making new friends or going to new things produces a huge amount  
**[0:17:51-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:51):**  of anxiety in me.  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:52):**  But I tend to find that when I am brave enough to reach out or to go somewhere, even if that  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:17:58):**  does involve some travel, that it does change things for the better.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:01):**  One of the things that I know that you have done much more of recently, you've got a dog,  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:08):**  and you've gone out and it's kind of forced you once or twice a day to go and have this  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:14):**  regular walk.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:15):**  Having the dog has totally transformed our life.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:18):**  We got him mainly because we wanted to bring some lightness and joy into our lives around  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:24):**  the death of Wendy's dad.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:25):**  And he certainly did that.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:27):**  Every time I take Dash for a walk, I go to somewhere called Walmart most times, and it  
**[0:18:31-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:31):**  takes about 40 minutes.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:33):**  And you can start off the walk and the thoughts are racing in your head and you're maybe angry  
**[0:18:38-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:38):**  about something or worried about something.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:40):**  And by the time I'm halfway around the walk, I'm slowing down.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:43):**  I'm listening.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:44):**  I'm feeling the wind on my face.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:46):**  And like you say, I'm looking at the birds or maybe the seals if they're there, and the  
**[0:18:50-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:50):**  trees and feeling the breeze and looking across the sea.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:54):**  And it just feels wonderful.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:55):**  It gives me some space.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:18:56):**  It gives me the chance to not have to concentrate on the day to day life, but to actually relax  
**[0:19:02-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:02):**  a little bit.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:03):**  And having the dog with me gives me exercise too.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:05):**  The exercise is wonderful.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:07):**  I've managed to get myself incredibly unfit over the years.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:11):**  And just getting out every day for a short walk really makes a huge difference to how  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:15):**  I feel in myself.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:16):**  It's interesting because, you know, if I have an argument at home, then I find actually  
**[0:19:20-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:20):**  that going for a walk can do the same thing.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:23):**  And actually, if I'm not feeling like going out and or it's pouring down with rain and  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:28):**  you know, the wind's blowing a gale, then actually just sitting down for that half hour  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:32):**  and watching a sitcom, you know, can be really helpful as well.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:37):**  Just sitting on the phone and doing that is it's something about that kind of taking 20  
**[0:19:42-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:42):**  or 30 minutes.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:43):**  It seems to need to be for me about that length of time that just lets me kind of release  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:49):**  some of those stresses that are going on in life to climb back down off my high horse,  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:19:55):**  if it's an argument, or just kind of take some of that space so that I can re-engage  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:01):**  with the challenges that I was having and be more successful.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:06):**  I think that's such a sensible point.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:09):**  I think sometimes with the pressures of life nowadays, we can get ourselves incredibly  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:14):**  wound up and it can be really, really important just to take that space before it bursts out  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:18):**  of us in ways we don't want it to do.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:20):**  And that can be in all sorts of fashions.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:22):**  Like you say, for me, sometimes it's just writing.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:25):**  I love to write, for instance.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:28):**  Other times it's what sounds silly, but just curling up in bed.  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:31):**  Sometimes I just need to do that because it's good.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:34):**  And other times it's finding a way of confining my vulnerability in someone I trust, which  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:41):**  tends to be my partner, Wendy.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:43):**  It can take me ages to know that I'm upset and distressed and irritable.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:48):**  And Wendy is wonderful at saying to me, to just sit down and talk to her and to try to  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:20:54):**  work out why I'm not sleeping or why I'm sleeping all the time or why I'm drinking all the time.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:00):**  And it is such a relief after you've sat down and suddenly you realise why you're so wound  
**[0:21:05-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:05):**  up and can relax again.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:07):**  And some of that irritability and that exhaustion just fades away.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:12):**  We talked about farming being associated with lots of different mental illness and challenges  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:19):**  around that.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:22):**  And part of the challenge is trying to help people to get intervention before it's too  
**[0:21:26-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:26):**  late.  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:27):**  And farmer suicides, officially, they're more than one a week in the UK, which is a staggering  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:32):**  number.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:34):**  What kind of illnesses are they that you've come across within the farming sector?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:39):**  Why do you think that that mental illness is higher, the levels are higher than general  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:45):**  society within the farming community?  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:47):**  I would imagine some of the more serious mental illnesses which tend to have more of a genetic  
**[0:21:53-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:53):**  component are just as common with farmers as other people.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:21:56):**  But some of the experiences of depression and anxiety can be caused by the environment  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:01):**  you're in and how life is.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:04):**  And certainly from speaking to farmers, I'm aware that they can be under an incredible  
**[0:22:10-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:10):**  amount of pressure.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:11):**  Their job is a very, very tough one, one I certainly couldn't do.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:16):**  Finances can be really, really difficult.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:17):**  The bureaucracy can be absolutely horrendous and that the future is difficult with all  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:22):**  the stuff that's happening with Brexit and so on.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:24):**  It must be very hard to know what the future is going to be like.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:27):**  And that also they can be very, very isolated.  
**[0:22:30-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:30):**  And sadly, in the case of suicide, the means to complete suicide are quite easy in rural  
**[0:22:36-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:36):**  and farming communities.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:37):**  I think that those are the sorts of reasons it may be so high amongst farmers.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:42):**  And maybe there is perhaps still a remnant of that culture of saying, I just need to  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:46):**  soldier on and carry on and cope and be strong when sometimes being strong is actually biting  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:53):**  off your nose because you're determined to show you're OK when in fact you're not.  
**[0:22:57-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:57):**  You talked about issues that are happening at the moment.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:22:59):**  Clearly Brexit is first and foremost the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:04):**  The fact that farm gate prices are very low.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:08):**  And so an awful lot of farmers are heavily reliant on the support that they get from  
**[0:23:13-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:13):**  taxpayers.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:16):**  In that situation, I mean, clearly where the future is so uncertain, it must be very difficult  
**[0:23:24-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:24):**  to be able to take hold of those lifelines that create some stability.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:29):**  And do you have any suggestions for people who, you know, their life, their economic  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:33):**  life is really very challenging because it is so uncertain at the moment out there in  
**[0:23:39-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:39):**  the country.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:40):**  What are the things that people can do?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:42):**  What are the tips that you can give them?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:44):**  I think if I was a farmer, I could feel very, very worried about my future at the moment.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:50):**  And some things are just so difficult to cope with.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:53):**  I think there are a number of farming organisations that provide support to farmers and a number  
**[0:23:59-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:23:59):**  of helplines.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:00):**  Some of those are conventional mental health helplines, but some are specific to farmers.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:04):**  And I suppose you'll be more aware, especially of the ones in England, because I don't know  
**[0:24:08-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:08):**  about the English ones.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:10):**  But I know there are some levels of support in Scotland where farmers can get emotional  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:15):**  support, financial advice and that sort of thing.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:19):**  And that is, I think, really helpful.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:21):**  I think also, even if it doesn't solve some of the complexities of life in an uncertain  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:27):**  future, being able to talk with each other is sometimes really, really helpful.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:34):**  Sharing problems really can ease some of the burden sometimes, I think.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:38):**  It doesn't solve all the problems, but it makes it slightly less intense and lonely  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:42):**  when you can speak to another person and say, I'm absolutely terrified about what to do.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:47):**  I don't need a bank or whatever.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:49):**  And someone can say, yes, I am too, or else say, yes, I had that problem, but I did something  
**[0:24:54-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:54):**  to get out of it.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:55):**  And that was this.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:24:56):**  And if people find it difficult to speak to people that they know to let to take off those  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:01):**  masks that we were talking about earlier, you know, if they associate themselves with  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:06):**  the person in the family who is strong, who is able to cope and they don't feel yet able  
**[0:25:11-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:11):**  to open up to a family member, then presumably, if we can point people to helplines, but it's  
**[0:25:21-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:21):**  not quite so much of a step to speak to a stranger, or is it?  
**[0:25:25-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:25):**  It varies.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:26):**  For some people, speaking to a stranger is absolutely terrifying.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:29):**  And for other people, it provides a degree of security because they're not known by that  
**[0:25:34-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:34):**  person.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:35):**  I think that's also quite difficult in rural areas because you do tend to be known by most  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:40):**  people, but I suppose if you're going, say, to the health services, then they do have  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:45):**  a imperative of confidentiality.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:48):**  So you can be sure that if you go to see a GP or a nurse or whoever, that they will listen  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:54):**  to you and they can't break confidentiality and tell other people what you're going through  
**[0:25:58-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:25:58):**  and that it's for your health and with other health professionals.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:01):**  And maybe that will provide some security to farmers who are maybe reluctant to admit  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:06):**  that they're not coping, to know that the health service does have standards of conduct  
**[0:26:11-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:11):**  which would respect what you're saying to them.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:13):**  Are there things that people can do, that the society can do, to help to break down  
**[0:26:19-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:19):**  the stigma of mental illness?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:21):**  And for me as an individual and as part of a community, a rural community, to start recognising  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:28):**  where some of these challenges lie and to help farmers who may not even know that they're  
**[0:26:32-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:32):**  starting to fall into mental illness?  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:35):**  I think one thing that's very well known is that having contact with people who experience  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:40):**  mental illness is the best way of challenging stigma.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:44):**  But I think as a community, for all of us, I think looking at difference and maybe celebrating  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:49):**  that rather than being suspicious of it is a really important thing.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:26:54):**  I think also recognising that mental illness is not separate and belonging to a strange  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:00):**  alien set of other people, that we all experience different degrees of wellbeing and mental  
**[0:27:06-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:06):**  health.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:07):**  And some of us, many of us, will experience mental illness and that it's just a natural  
**[0:27:10-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:10):**  part of life.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:11):**  And I think sometimes I see communities, for instance, the Murray wellbeing hub, I love  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:17):**  that, where people are all saying we want to look at mental health and we want to look  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:21):**  at mental illness and we're going to look at creating community connections throughout  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:25):**  our community, whether we've experienced mental illness or not.  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:29):**  But the main thing is that we're creating a sense of belonging, a sense of connection,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:34):**  a sense of the fact that we can all in our different ways improve each other's mental  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:38):**  health by looking out for each other.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:40):**  And I wonder if one of the challenges is, you know, when I think about mental illness  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:45):**  and the idea of asking for help, that it somehow seems like it's going to become a label that's  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:49):**  going to be with you for life, that you'll always be somebody who needed help.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:27:54):**  And I guess it's about perhaps partly about sort of letting people know that we have different  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:01):**  phases in our lives that, you know, sometimes we'll feel poorly and go to the doctors, you  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:06):**  know, we've got flu or whatever, and sometimes we'll be finding life just mentally really  
**[0:28:11-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:11):**  difficult.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:13):**  But that doesn't mean that we're always going to find things really difficult and we can  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:17):**  get better in the same way that you cope with your own diagnosis.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:21):**  I think so, I think it's really important to recognise that within the spectrum of mental  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:26):**  illness that we have serious illnesses, less serious illnesses, lifelong illnesses and  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:31):**  temporary illnesses.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:33):**  So just as we can get a cold and be under the weather for a few days or get the flu  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:37):**  and be under the weather for a couple of weeks, so can we have experiences with our emotions  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:41):**  and our moods and our wellbeing that are difficult to cope with for a short period of time.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:46):**  And then other times those extend for longer, but usually most often we recover, get help  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:51):**  and face life again and it's just a blip in our lives that anyone can go through, like  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:56):**  you can go through any physical illness.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:28:58):**  And other people, for instance, people like me possibly do have lifelong illnesses for  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:03):**  which we will need support all our lives, but that doesn't necessarily mean that we  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:08):**  don't have good lives or we can't still contribute to the world we're a part of.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:12):**  That was Graham Morgan talking to me about farming and mental illness.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:17):**  Graham's book Start can be found in bookshops and online, and it's a remarkably open, generous  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:22):**  and optimistic read.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:24):**  A farming life is generally a good life, but it's demanding and it can be stressful.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:29):**  It's hardly a surprise that farmers and farm workers can feel isolated, depressed, and  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:35):**  sometimes just unable to cope.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:37):**  Mental illness is an illness, not a weakness, and it's a sign of strength to seek out the  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:42):**  help you need.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:44):**  Importantly, mental illness can be treated, sometimes with support and sometimes with  
**[0:29:49-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:49):**  medication.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:51):**  If you're feeling isolated or depressed, or you think you know someone who is, help is  
**[0:29:56-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:29:56):**  at hand and these are just a couple of the organisations that provide direct support  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:01):**  by phone and by email in the United Kingdom.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:05):**  Farming Help is a UK-wide helpline which provides farmers in need with free, impartial and confidential

**[0:30:24-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:24):**  call.

**[0:30:32-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:32):**  Farmgate isn't just a UK podcast, and I know that we have many listeners around the world.  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:37):**  Unfortunately I can't list every helpline, but if you Google advice, farming and mental  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farming--mental-illness-eaiu78#t=0:30:42):**  illness followed by your country, then it's likely that you'll be able to find help too.

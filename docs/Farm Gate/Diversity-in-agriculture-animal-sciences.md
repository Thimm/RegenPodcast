### Farm Gate  (Mon, 22 Mar 2021 16:50:40)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Flynnlow Costayne. In this programme we're discussing  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:10):**  racism, how to improve diversity in British agriculture and animal sciences, and how we  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:15):**  might successfully encourage more of our black, Asian and minority ethnic population to enjoy  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:20):**  the countryside. I'm joined by two people who've experienced racism in their everyday  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:24):**  lives and who are leading efforts to break down barriers so that our rural professions  
**[0:00:29-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:29):**  better reflect the UK's population as a whole. Navaratnam Potheban is a dairy vet who co-founded  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:35):**  the British Veterinary Ethnicity and Diversity Society, and Bushra Abu-Helil, who's a second-year  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:40):**  PhD student focused on poultry health and welfare at the Quadram Institute, and she's  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:45):**  Vice Chair of the BAME Ecologist Network. Thebe can be found on Twitter using the handle  
**[0:00:50-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:50):**  at NavaratnamPart1, and Bushra is on Twitter as at BushyB94. Welcome both. Hello. Hi, thanks  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:00:59):**  for having us. Thebe, we know that agriculture is a stubbornly white profession. Does that  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:03):**  matter? I think it matters massively. So we talk about why do we need diversity, and again,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:09):**  diversity brings a wealth of talent, a wealth of thought, a wealth of experience, a wealth  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:14):**  of ideas. And I think for agriculture as a sector to grow, it needs that talent there.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:20):**  But also agriculture is meant to be providing food for the population, and it needs to be  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:24):**  able to be connected to that population, first to understand what the population wants, but  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:28):**  also for the population to be embraced and be close to agriculture. And again, the sector  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:33):**  therefore needs to reflect the diversity in the country it is supplying and supporting.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:38):**  And so I think, and we talk about this disconnect all the time, but that is a lot to do with  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:43):**  the lack of diversity creating that disconnect. So there's a degree to which that diversity  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:47):**  means that there's potentially a dearth of talent coming into the industry, but also  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:52):**  when we've got 8 million people from BAME communities living in Britain, many of whom  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:01:56):**  will want to eat different sorts of foods, there's a gap in the market for people to  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:00):**  grow different products. Yeah. And also it's not only do we need to cater for the different  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:05):**  tastes, but also if we want to promote British quality and the British standards and promote  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:10):**  the message of farming, how can you do that if you don't understand or are able to converse  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:16):**  with different people? We talk about children understanding about farming again, it's a  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:21):**  cycle. Bushra, do you think there is a genuine resistance to people of colour in rural professions  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:26):**  such as farming and veterinary science, or is it just that BAME communities tend to live  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:30):**  in more urban areas and so gravitate towards the sort of jobs that we might naturally associate  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:35):**  with towns and cities? I think it is a combination of both. I think inspiring that in nature  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:40):**  initial connection to nature and the outdoors is a really essential part of it and getting  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:45):**  people to do that as young as possible is great. But even over lockdown, if you look  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:49):**  at the national parks, only 5% of their visitors came from BAME backgrounds. And part of that  
**[0:02:54-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:54):**  was also to do with transportation. The fact that many people who are living in cities  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:02:59):**  don't necessarily have access to cars and therefore it's much more difficult for them  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:03):**  to get out to our beautiful countryside and experience some of our amazing national parks  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:08):**  that will help to inspire that real love for nature and hopefully then lead into those  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:13):**  kind of career paths. I also think people aren't necessarily aware of the diversity  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:19):**  of career paths that are available within agriculture and within the countryside in  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:23):**  general. People think that you just have to be a farmer or a vet and those are the other  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:27):**  options when actually there is a whole range of things that you can do like myself who's  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:31):**  doing actual research to help benefit people. Thanks Bushra and some of those issues I think  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:36):**  we're going to get into in slightly more detail slightly later in the programme. I mentioned  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:39):**  in the introduction that both of you had experienced racism. I mean, you know, growing up and also  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:44):**  in your professional lives, I guess. What was life like for you growing up?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:49):**  My teen years I spent growing up in ultra rural Essex. I was the only person of colour  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:54):**  really at my high school and I was the only person from a Muslim heritage background as  
**[0:03:58-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:03:58):**  well. I once got into a really big argument at school about a racist Islamophobic joke  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:05):**  that was told and I was obviously offended by it. And it's caused quite a large argument  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:10):**  and by the end of it, I was the one who was pulled aside by the teacher for making a fuss  
**[0:04:14-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:14):**  and for causing trouble making, which was an issue and I was the one who was trying  
**[0:04:18-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:18):**  to be outspoken against the racism. And obviously my family are fiercely protected of me, but  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:24):**  we also never wanted to draw too much attention to myself either and to our family as a whole  
**[0:04:29-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:29):**  when you are the only minority in a community.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:32):**  It's interesting, isn't it? Because, you know, with my kids, if I felt that they had been  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:37):**  wronged, that the teachers had jumped in, they'd come to the wrong conclusion, you know,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:40):**  I'd be down on the school like a tonne of bricks. And you're saying that for your family,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:45):**  there was a feeling that you couldn't do that, that in drawing attention to yourself, it  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:50):**  would kind of make the problem worse.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:52):**  Yeah, there was always that hesitation and that is also something that I've had to break  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:04:56):**  down in my professional career later on and understand that speaking out is actually a  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:01):**  very good thing and an important thing for us to do. And it doesn't make me a troublemaker  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:06):**  in any way at all. So that was actually something I had to unlearn as well as I progressed in  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:10):**  my career.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:11):**  So that was obviously at school. Have you experienced racism professionally as well?  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:16):**  And did things change when you went to university? Were you suddenly surrounded by people of  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:19):**  colour in a way that you weren't at high school?  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:21):**  I was really hoping that would be the case. And in the grand scheme of things, it was.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:25):**  I went to university in Cambridge and overall the campus is very diverse. But on my course  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:29):**  for zoology, there was only one other person of colour. So I soon realised that, yeah,  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:34):**  I'd certainly picked an industry where the resilience I'd built as a teen would certainly  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:39):**  be coming in handy. But whenever I go out to a new farm or even if I'm going to a new  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:44):**  place of academia and talking about my work, I sometimes always question, will people have  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:50):**  an issue with my age, with my gender, with my name or with my skin colour? Like which  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:05:56):**  thing are they going to pick? And so you can probably tell I'm a very bubbly and positive  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:01):**  person and that is really intentional. I'm extremely passionate. And in the past that  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:07):**  has been perceived wrongly, that's been perceived as aggression or something. And I'm so worried  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:12):**  to be labelled that angry black woman. Once again, that troublemaker, they can sometimes  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:18):**  make you feel a little bit reserved. Certainly in my professional career, I experienced racism  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:24):**  more in the form of microaggressions. So these would be things like, oh, you speak English  
**[0:06:29-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:29):**  surprisingly well, despite the fact I was born here and being British my entire life.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:34):**  Even when I once submitted a research article to a peer review paper, one of the first comments  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:40):**  from the peer reviewer was have someone with a native level of English read through your  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:44):**  work. I was the lead author and I'm British and the second author was Australian. So both  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:48):**  of us were very much native English speakers, just as scientists, we're not that good at  
**[0:06:53-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:53):**  writing prose all the time.  
**[0:06:55-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:55):**  Steve, did you grow up in the countryside as well?  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:06:57):**  I grew up up north. I grew up in Scotland and in Yorkshire, but in towns. So I didn't  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:02):**  really grow up in the countryside. I've only sort of lived in the countryside since I started  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:06):**  working as a vet. And yeah, and what Bushra shared, I can completely relate to because  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:11):**  I think, you know, even though we're different sides of the country, different backgrounds,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:14):**  different everything, a lot of the similar sort of experiences.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:18):**  Now, Steve, you love cows, but you grew up, as you say, you know, in towns, in big towns.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:23):**  Why cows? Where did they come in?  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:26):**  It's weird because when I, so I did an astrology degree like Bushra, but I did it in Manchester  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:30):**  and I worked with primates and small animals in that course. So when I did veterinary,  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:34):**  I thought, yeah, I'm going to become a small animal vet. I'm going to become a researcher.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:37):**  And that was my idea and to work in a research establishment. And I think, and I've done  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:41):**  a bit of working on farms to get into vet school and I liked it. But when I was at vet  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:46):**  school, I really enjoyed just standing on farms. And I think I enjoyed the working with  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:50):**  the individual animal and working with the herd, which you didn't get working with  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:54):**  cats and dogs. And also I just enjoyed going from one farm to a different farm and meeting  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:07:58):**  the family and the fresh air. Yeah. And so I think that's, and I think because cows  
**[0:08:03-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:03):**  were there, that's what I enjoyed. Yeah. And then I'd fuddled it down to dairy cows.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:06):**  So that's my main passion.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:07):**  So how have you experienced racism in your professional life or growing up?  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:11):**  Exactly like Bushra, everywhere I go, when I was a child, I was the only person of colour.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:16):**  And like Bushra, my parents also almost suppressed anything that I sort of came up with, like,  
**[0:08:21-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:21):**  oh, why is that? Why is this? And I think it's just to keep your head down and get through  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:24):**  it because my parents immigrated to this country and they had to fight for everything. They  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:29):**  came with nothing, literally their suitcases, and they had to fight for everything they  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:33):**  achieved. But it was about being quiet and not speaking up because then the moment they  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:38):**  get excluded, they would have lost everything. So again, they taught that to us as children,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:42):**  not realizing that actually we're born here, we've got rights and we've got our own feelings.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:46):**  They almost became that attitude. So I had, you know, at school, you know, people saying  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:50):**  racist jokes and things like that, but you just accepted it and went on with it. You  
**[0:08:53-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:53):**  tried maybe to complain once or twice, but when the teachers didn't do anything, you  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:08:56):**  left it. Then at university, again, I was the only person, I was one of maybe four people  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:01):**  of colour in my vet school in my year. And in the entire vet school, out of five, six  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:05):**  hundred people, there are probably 20 people of colour. So again, your focus is about finishing  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:10):**  your exams and getting through the course. You haven't got time to fight for your own  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:14):**  rights and for you to be accepted. And actually what you do is you just accept it because  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:18):**  you just need to get on with these people, especially in a course like veterinary where  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:22):**  you're so grouped together and you do exams together and you do everything together, you  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:26):**  just have to do it. But, you know, there are good times as well. I'm not saying that it's  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:29):**  a horrible place and you're getting racism left, right and centre. It's nothing like  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:33):**  that. But like Bushra said, it's the microaggressions are worse than the overt aggressions. You don't  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:38):**  get that people saying the P word to me in the middle of the street or at vet school,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:43):**  just the microaggressions, maybe people not pronouncing my name properly or purposely  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:47):**  giving me an anglicised name. And then I think in my professional life, you know, things  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:52):**  like when I apply for a job, OK, the first assumption is I'm a foreign vet. You know,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:09:56):**  people won't even look to where I qualified from because of my name. And you just think,  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:00):**  well, you know, I'm just as I'm just the same as any other vet who's qualified in the UK  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:05):**  and people assume things based on my name, you know, being asked, well, am I comfortable  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:09):**  treating cows or dealing with pigs and assuming I might be Muslim or I might be Hindu or something  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:15):**  like that without even talking to me. And I think it's those things where as if I was  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:18):**  a white person, that wouldn't have even come out. So it's those extra things that I need  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:22):**  to tackle based on my name and my colour that if I was white, then I wouldn't have had to  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:27):**  do it. It's such a different way of growing up, isn't it? You know, and I think back to  
**[0:10:31-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:31):**  my childhood and, you know, I didn't have any questions about whether I had the right  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:37):**  to exist in the community that I lived in. I may have had other issues that, you know,  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:42):**  were sort of coming in, you know, and bits of bullying here and there and moments in  
**[0:10:46-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:46):**  my life when I felt that I needed to keep my head down because there was a particular  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:49):**  individual. But that whole idea of not being able to challenge people when they are, you  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:55):**  know, doing some of the things that both of you have said and that you just need to keep  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:10:59):**  your head down and just accept those microaggressions. It sounds like such a different way of life  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:05):**  that you're kind of combating almost on a daily basis.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:09):**  You are combating daily basis and it almost becomes like second nature. So it probably  
**[0:11:13-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:13):**  happens a lot more than we realise, but we've almost developed this coping mechanism and  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:18):**  sometimes we don't even realise we're doing it. And sometimes when it is pointed out,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:22):**  it does make you think, oh, do you know what? I do that as well. Do you know recently with  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:25):**  all these articles and things like that, sometimes I hear experiences from other people and I  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:28):**  think, do you know what? I never thought about it, but I do that sometimes and oh, and actually  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:33):**  the when they say it, it does sound horrible. And actually, why am I doing that? You know,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:37):**  but sometimes I think, I don't know, even now I'm still not comfortable enough to be  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:42):**  me. And I still do a lot of things just because end of the day, you know, I'm hoping that  
**[0:11:47-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:47):**  enough is tackled now that maybe the next generation can tackle it even further.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:50):**  Do you think that the way that you are able to support your children at school is different  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:11:56):**  to the way that your parents were able to protect you and support you when you were  
**[0:12:01-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:01):**  at school?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:02):**  Absolutely. So with my children, I'm very aware of making sure that they're aware of  
**[0:12:06-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:06):**  who they are, their identity. So I talk about where their grandparents were from. I make  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:11):**  sure that they are aware of some of the culture and traditions. I'm happy for them to talk  
**[0:12:17-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:17):**  about it at school, you know, when they talk about themselves, I say, you know, talk about  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:20):**  who you are and what you are. And also, I want them to understand that it's different,  
**[0:12:25-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:25):**  but that's not a bad thing. So you know, even things like their skin colour, it might be  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:28):**  different, but that's okay. That's normal. And actually, that's you, who you are. And  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:34):**  the same with my daughter, you know, when Bushra was talking, you know, being a woman  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:37):**  and being a person of colour and that intersectional idea. So again, I talk to my daughter about  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:42):**  being a woman of colour. And I try and highlight and I like to talk, show, highlight examples  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:49):**  of role models out there so that they can be who they want to be as well, which I think  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:53):**  is really something that I was never shown. And I was never told. I try and push them  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:12:57):**  to be positive about their identity. I still think that they struggle. And I think sometimes  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:02):**  that they, you know, end of the day, things, there is still a lot of issues in this country,  
**[0:13:06-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:06):**  but I am much more proactive about that.  
**[0:13:09-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:09):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:08):**  Bushra, thinking about the racism that you've experienced in your life. I mean, you've talked  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:13):**  about some of it. And how much of it do you think was overt or, you know, kind of deliberate  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:19):**  on behalf of the people who were expressing that racism? And how much of it was down to  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:23):**  simply a lack of understanding or experience and knowing how to interact with somebody  
**[0:13:28-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:28):**  of colour?  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:29):**  There are certainly some examples I've had which have been absolutely deliberate racism.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:33):**  Like there's no other way to look around it. I once had, I was with two white colleagues  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:38):**  at work and the cleaner opened the door for the two white colleagues and I was just behind  
**[0:13:43-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:43):**  them and they shut the door before I could even go through, which was just very much  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:47):**  deliberate and overt. Similarly, one time me and my sister had gone shopping and a white  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:53):**  family refused to let us go into the lift with them, which again, was just outright  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:13:58):**  overt racism with people we don't even know. I think especially at a young age, it can  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:03):**  be difficult for you to tell. And it's only when you start discussing these experiences  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:07):**  once you're older that you begin to realise what happened and the impact this had. So  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:12):**  I remember visiting a friend's house when I was younger and I was told by her parents  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:17):**  when I first came in, oh, you are the first coloured person we've ever had in this house.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:22):**  And for me, I had no idea how to respond. Am I supposed to act differently? What are  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:27):**  you expecting of me? Like you've made this huge like comment and observation. How do  
**[0:14:33-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:33):**  you want me to respond? Like I am just a child. And I also had experience during primary school  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:39):**  when I was on the playground and you know those checkered dresses that the primary school  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:43):**  children wear, I was wearing one of those and someone came up on the playground and  
**[0:14:47-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:47):**  completely unzipped my dress and they asked, are you made of wood or chocolate underneath?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:51):**  Which again, is just, it's ignorance and children are children, but these ignorances are still  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:14:56):**  so, so hurtful and they do have a big impact. I had such identity issues throughout my entire  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:02):**  life being biracial, having both black heritage and white heritage, and then being in a school  
**[0:15:08-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:08):**  that was all white people, I was constantly trying to fit in somewhere where I definitely  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:13):**  didn't and people made it very apparent to me that I didn't fit in either.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:17):**  And of course, when you're getting comments like that from children in the playground,  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:21):**  you know, and you sort of look back on it from hindsight, those are probably reflecting  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:24):**  things that their parents have said at home, isn't it? Now you're a very rounded person  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:30):**  now. And so how have you managed to deal with those sort of issues of identity that you  
**[0:15:35-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:35):**  were talking about just then?  
**[0:15:37-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:37):**  I definitely think one of the things that have helped me is once I did go to university,  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:40):**  I managed to make a greater diversity of friends from different backgrounds and sharing these  
**[0:15:45-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:45):**  experiences really helped me to feel empowered and to have a better understanding of my experiences.  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:52):**  You mentioned earlier, so I'm the vice chair of the BAME Ecological Network. And the point  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:15:56):**  of this is that we want some kind of network where people from these environmental sectors  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:02):**  and agricultural sectors, zoologists, plant biologists, all different people that feel  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:06):**  like they are minorities within their areas to be able to come together. And those meetings  
**[0:16:10-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:10):**  have a really profound effect on just how empowered we all feel to create that safe  
**[0:16:17-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:17):**  space is a really, really unique thing. And I do remember the first time I ever had that  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:22):**  very specific feeling. And it was just before I started my PhD, I was looking at what I  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:26):**  wanted to do. And in London, they had a seminar that was specifically for people of colour  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:33):**  that were looking to go to do their PhD. And I turned up and I was in a room of about 50  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:38):**  other people of colour that were all looking to do their PhD. They were all as passionate  
**[0:16:42-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:42):**  as I was about scientists who all had the same kind of experiences of imposter syndrome  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:48):**  and wondering if they weren't good enough. And that was the first time I'd ever had that  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:51):**  of like actually being with real peers for my career, like actual people who really understood.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:16:57):**  I think I've always been very resilient throughout. And I've always been very confident and outspoken  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:03):**  as well, which has really helped. And like I said, I do have a fiercely protective family.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:07):**  So although we wouldn't want to draw attention to ourselves publicly within our households,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:11):**  we'd very much have these open discussions and create an understanding of our identity,  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:18):**  much like what Thibe was saying he does with his daughters and helping them to understand  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:22):**  what is a part of them. I remember again, during high school, when you're going through  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:26):**  this process of work experience, and you have outside companies come in, and they give you  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:30):**  interviews. And one of the things I mentioned in my interview is that I'm really passionate  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:34):**  about my culture and my religion. And the interviewer stopped me right there and said,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:39):**  never, never, when you're going into a profession, do you ever mention your culture or religion?  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:43):**  Never, never, never, like is a really big thing. Whereas now, it's something I'm very  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:48):**  comfortable talking about. And I found actually, people are really interested to listen and  
**[0:17:52-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:52):**  to learn and to hear about it.  
**[0:17:54-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:17:54):**  The thinking about the countryside and being a person of colour in the countryside and working in the countryside,  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:01):**  it feels like there's something of a vicious cycle that rural communities tend to be less  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:06):**  diverse, which in turn means that rural careers might well be less attractive to people of  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:11):**  colour. And I just, you know, I wonder, how do we start to break that cycle?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:15):**  I think there's a big assumption there that rural careers are less attractive, because  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:19):**  why should they be less attractive? End of the day, you know, there is so much opportunity  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:23):**  and variety in agriculture, like Bushra said earlier. And again, we're just assuming that  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:28):**  if you go in the countryside, you're setting a tractor and that's life. But actually, you  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:32):**  know, there are data analysis, there are geneticists, there are crop scientists, there are all  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:38):**  sorts of different things that need that are in the agriculture, or in the rural sector,  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:42):**  even working for some of these land agents and countryside management. So there's loads  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:48):**  of different jobs there. And again, people in the urban communities don't know these  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:53):**  things exist. So yes, there is a vicious cycle because there is very little advertisements  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:18:58):**  of the rural countryside to urban people. And I think the assumption is urban people  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:03):**  aren't interested. But if you think about it, a lot of immigrants in this country come  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:07):**  from farming backgrounds. In fact, I'd say there's probably a bigger connection of farming  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:12):**  among BME people in general compared to the white community. But because they live in  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:16):**  the city, we just assume that they don't know anything about farming. But both my parents  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:19):**  come from farming backgrounds, both their grandparents' farming backgrounds. Yeah, I  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:22):**  was born in a town. But my parents talked about those stories and I've got that understanding.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:27):**  So again, it's taken away those assumptions, and actually given an opportunity of going,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:32):**  well, this is what rural life's about. These are the opportunities that are there for you.  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:35):**  These are what you can be doing, and breaking down those barriers. And for people in the  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:39):**  rural setting, it's about how do we bring those connections closer. Now, we know there's  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:44):**  a huge technology issue with internet and things like that, and broadband issues. And  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:48):**  what COVID has taught us is we don't need to travel to meet people. We can do it online.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:53):**  We can read about it. We can listen. And we can talk. And so it's, again, it's using those  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:19:58):**  things that we've learned better to bring the communities together.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:01):**  Mason, who needs to take more responsibility in changing these attitudes? Is it professional  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:08):**  bodies? Is it teachers and schools or government or rural councils? Where does the responsibility  
**[0:20:13-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:13):**  for this lie?  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:14):**  So I think government bodies, and especially schools, are a really essential way for us  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:19):**  to be able to change these attitudes. But I do think that this is everyone's responsibility,  
**[0:20:25-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:25):**  and not just people of colour, where the responsibility often falls on. It's also the responsibility  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:31):**  of white people who are living in the countryside. You know, make sure it is as welcoming and  
**[0:20:36-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:36):**  as inclusive as possible. Be as friendly and as inclusive as possible. But I also think  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:42):**  there's a huge responsibility that lies with the media. Thieve mentioned earlier about  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:46):**  role models and the importance of that, and representation is so important. For me personally,  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:52):**  I found Michaela Strachan, honestly, one of my all time best role models. Her on the Really  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:20:58):**  Wild Show definitely helped me get onto the career path I'm on now. At the moment, we  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:03):**  have Gillian Burke, who's on Spring Watch. She is fantastic. I think she's a fantastic  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:08):**  example of representation. And similarly, Sean Fletcher on Countryfile. But I know that  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:13):**  he has even received a lot of racism since some of his most recent shows talking about  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:19):**  racism in the countryside. He's actually faced a lot of negativity on social media after  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:24):**  speaking out about this. So it is really important that we have this representation because it  
**[0:21:29-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:29):**  is so clearly needed when you see people's reactions about it.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:32):**  Do you have any sort of insight into where that negativity is coming from on social media?  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:37):**  People don't want to be considered racist. People don't want to admit that Britain is  
**[0:21:41-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:41):**  racist and has systemic racism issues. I mean, just look at the response from the Sainsbury's  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:47):**  advert over Christmas, like the disgusting racist responses that Sainsbury's received  
**[0:21:51-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:51):**  after that. And how can you deny that there isn't a racism issue within the UK? And I  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:21:57):**  think that's a big issue as well. Often people are like, well, I'm not racist. Of course  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:02):**  I'm not racist. But they're not actually willing to learn about what some of the barriers we're  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:05):**  facing are or what some of our fears or concerns are. They're just, yeah, immediately on the  
**[0:22:10-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:10):**  defence.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:11):**  It's remarkable, isn't it? I mean, I've literally heard people say to me, I'm not racist. I  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:15):**  just don't like black people. You know, it is remarkably ingrained in places. Now, I  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:21):**  grew up in the 1970s in a rural village in Worcestershire that was almost exclusively  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:26):**  white. And now I live in Dorset in a different rural village that's almost exclusively white.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:31):**  And it would be easy to conclude from that, that really nothing has changed in the intervening  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:35):**  decades. But it seems to me that actually quite a lot has changed. That people of colour  
**[0:22:39-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:39):**  are much better represented. I mean, you talked about representation in the media, Bushra.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:44):**  And there is more representation there. And there are more people from BAME communities  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:48):**  in top jobs in Britain and on the front line in politics. Equality is now required in law.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:54):**  You know, that's happened in my lifetime. And discrimination itself is generally treated  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:22:58):**  more seriously by the police.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:00):**  So Theve, I'm not for one moment suggesting that we haven't still got a mountain to climb.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:04):**  But have we perhaps at least reached the foothills of change?  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:08):**  That's an interesting one. Because, yeah, you've given me some examples. You know, you've  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:13):**  seen more politicians, you've seen three or four new politicians on the front benches  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:18):**  of the Conservatives. And so does that mean now the barriers for becoming an MP is broken  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:23):**  down and the Conservatives are not a racist party now? Really? And also, let's look at  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:28):**  the type of people they've put on those front benches. What type of representation are they?  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:32):**  So that would be one example. We look at the media, for example, OK, we're seeing more  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:36):**  BAME representation in the media. And we suppose, OK, that must be a change. But if you look  
**[0:23:41-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:41):**  at the top producers and directors, it's all white. Look at the Oscars last year, all white.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:46):**  If you look at the number of heroes, all white. If you look at top grossing films again. So  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:52):**  again, what has happened there? There are a few more. But are they representative of  
**[0:23:57-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:57):**  real change? You know, I think...  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:23:59):**  So if there's a mountain to climb, then you're saying that we haven't reached the foothills.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:04):**  We've just kind of got out of the car and paid for parking.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:06):**  Yeah, for real change, we haven't done the real change yet. We've done the awareness.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:10):**  So we're aware there's an issue. Black Lives Matter was an awareness time. Brexit and the  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:14):**  issues of that was an awareness time. But what has actually changed? Very little. You  
**[0:24:19-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:19):**  know, and that's what the issue is. And that's why people are angry or upset or are protesting  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:25):**  is because, yes, people think that by adding one or two black faces or brown faces to a  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:30):**  board means that change has happened. It hasn't changed anything for people on the ground.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:35):**  And so I think that's where we need to work on what are the systemic issues and barriers  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:39):**  for reducing the amount of racism and such like. And you mentioned earlier racism. Racism  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:44):**  is a word that makes people very uncomfortable. But what we've got to understand is racism  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:48):**  is not just one thing. Racism is a spectrum. And it can be anything from not serving someone,  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:53):**  you know, shutting the door in Bushra's face or it can be not giving me an interview based  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:24:58):**  on my name to throwing trash or shouting abuse out of a car window. And people think that  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:05):**  that is racism. And if you call someone a racist, it's the overt stuff. But what we're  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:08):**  going to understand is a spectrum and having those barriers is a racist thing to have.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:13):**  And it happens in all forms of society. Bushra, you're from a younger generation. How do you  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:18):**  think that Britain's relationship with race has changed during the course of your life?  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:23):**  So like Thieve said, I definitely think there has been more acceptance and awareness around  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:27):**  issues associated with race and ethnicity. People are definitely more willing to open  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:32):**  up a conversation about it, although there is sometimes still a little bit of reluctance.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:36):**  But I also fear that people think that I've been chosen for opportunities because of tokenism.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:42):**  So Thieve again mentioned briefly like the idea of having black and brown faces on a  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:46):**  board to show on paper that you've got some diversity. But for me, I've been told from  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:51):**  a young age that I would need to work twice as hard to get half as much. And so I've continued  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:25:57):**  to do that throughout my life. And it's now kind of caught up to a point where I'm in  
**[0:26:01-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:01):**  my professional career and people are noticing I am working twice as hard. Therefore, I do  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:05):**  deserve these opportunities. I have earned them. But there is still always this concern  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:10):**  I have been chosen because of the colour of my skin and because everyone else is white.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:14):**  Thieve, thinking around the changes that we've seen in society over the last few years, have  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:19):**  Brexit and the rise of nationalism in Britain started to reverse, you know, some of that,  
**[0:26:24-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:24):**  I mean, albeit limited progress that we've made?  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:27):**  No, I think what Brexit has done is exposed some of the limited progress that has occurred.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:33):**  I don't think people become racist overnight or people have racist thoughts overnight.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:39):**  And so what Brexit did is it made what people suppressed come out. So it does sound like,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:44):**  oh my God, we're worse than we were. We're not worse. We're just more aware of what the  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:49):**  situation in this country was. And I think before, because everyone was the British way  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:53):**  of being polite and keeping things in was that compared to the Americans, which are  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:26:58):**  a bit more outward, you know, they'll just say as it is. And that's why we think America's  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:01):**  racist and Britain is not. But actually Brexit has shown that we're probably the same, but  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:06):**  we just hold it in a different way. So it's exposed, I think, more of the holes in society.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:11):**  We've talked quite a lot about diversity in professional lives and about living, you know,  
**[0:27:16-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:16):**  as a person of colour in rural communities. I wonder if we could think for a little bit  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:19):**  about trying to get people of colour out of towns and into the countryside. And Bushra,  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:24):**  when we spoke before the recording, you talked about the invisible barriers to the countryside  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:29):**  that exist for people of colour, about the way in which people from BAME communities  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:33):**  perhaps were worried about how they might be perceived or even that they might not be  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:37):**  sure what to do or how to behave in a countryside setting. I wonder what kind of things you  
**[0:27:41-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:41):**  have in mind.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:42):**  Well, I know one of the fears for people of colour coming to the countryside, particularly  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:47):**  for my friends' parents, is they very much believed that going to the countryside would  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:51):**  be dangerous for them. There was a high possibility they would have some kind of racist experience  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:27:57):**  or experience some kind of adversity towards them. And they pass this information on down  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:02):**  to their children. Therefore, the countryside becomes this scary racist place that you don't  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:07):**  want to go and visit. So I think the first thing is just getting people out into the  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:11):**  countryside to realise that's not so much the case anymore.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:14):**  But another thing I mentioned earlier was that sometimes my passion can be misunderstood  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:19):**  for either aggression or for something else. And this is an issue I have as someone who's  
**[0:28:25-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:25):**  a huge nature enthusiast. I go to a lot of places birdwatching and if I see something  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:30):**  exciting, I'm going to be excited about it. But I am also knowledgeable. I know that if  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:35):**  it's breeding season and nesting season, obviously I'm not going to be vocal about what I've  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:39):**  seen because I'm not going to disturb the animals. There is still always a concern that  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:43):**  people don't know that I know how to behave in the countryside, even though that's where  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:48):**  I've always lived. One of the things I always think is that better  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:51):**  air quality, access to green spaces, that shouldn't be restricted to the privileged  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:28:56):**  few who can access the countryside. It shouldn't matter the colour of your skin. You should  
**[0:29:01-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:01):**  still be able to have all the benefits that you get from being outside. There have been  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:05):**  so many articles, particularly over lockdown, about how being outside can really improve  
**[0:29:11-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:11):**  your immune system as well as improving your mental health and wellbeing and general physical  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:15):**  fitness. There are so many benefits and it's so unfair that it is reserved for the privileged  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:20):**  few who are in the countryside. Now, just in terms of sort of practical steps  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:23):**  that could be taken, one of the things that you've mentioned to me previously is, is it,  
**[0:29:28-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:28):**  you know, better knowledge around the countryside code?  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:30):**  Yeah. So this is something that I think is really important. I really think that the  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:34):**  countryside code should be as accessible as the etiquette for public transport or as well  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:40):**  known as how to behave on the underground, like the London underground. It should be  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:44):**  that ingrained within people or at least that accessible so people can see it. Because I  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:48):**  always went to school in the countryside, we had people come in and teach us the countryside  
**[0:29:53-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:53):**  code. And that was a standard thing, particularly before the summer holiday, so that we knew  
**[0:29:57-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:29:57):**  how to behave. And that was both primary school and high school because they know that high  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:01):**  school students are also going to be going out and enjoying themselves. So it's just  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:05):**  important we know how to respect the land properly. And I think if everyone was able  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:09):**  to have that opportunity to learn the countryside code from a young age, there wouldn't be as  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:14):**  much fear visiting the countryside because you know the rules, you know when you should  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:18):**  and shouldn't leave a gate open, you know how to access things and where you should  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:22):**  and shouldn't be walking. So there's no chance for you even to get into trouble with the  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:26):**  locals because you know what you're doing. And it is straightforward, but I think a lot  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:29):**  of people visiting the countryside aren't even aware there is a countryside code. So  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:33):**  they wouldn't even necessarily know to look it up and to read up about it before visiting  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:37):**  these places. Having it on public transport, on trains, when people are arriving at these  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:42):**  places as well as actually at the national parks. So it is yeah, as easy and accessible  
**[0:30:46-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:46):**  as possible for people.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:47):**  Thepe, are there other things that we can do to help black, Asian and minority ethnic  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:53):**  communities to feel more welcome in the countryside?  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:30:55):**  So I think it's communicating with them in their spaces. So again, it's about people  
**[0:31:00-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:00):**  from the countryside or people who advocate for the countryside going into the spaces  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:04):**  where black, Asian, minority ethnic people are, talking to them and working with them  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:09):**  and then almost supporting them and getting them out as well. So like Bushra said earlier,  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:15):**  transport's a massive barrier. And so for example, I am a trustee for the Country Trust  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:19):**  and what they do is they take children from schools where 25% or more are on free school  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:24):**  meals, so low socioeconomic groups, and they take them to the countryside to give them  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:28):**  an opportunity on a farm or a food experience. And a lot of these children have never seen  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:33):**  grass. They live in flats and they live in cities where the only grass is around the  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:37):**  trees on the street. And so again, but it's giving them the opportunity and that experience,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:42):**  which I think was great. And another thing that we were doing was we were working, I'm  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:46):**  a trustee at St Wurberg's City Farms. You'd think an inner city farm in a deprived area  
**[0:31:51-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:51):**  would have a lot of, with a large BME population, would have a lot of people coming and visiting  
**[0:31:55-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:55):**  the farm. But what we discovered was these people didn't feel like they were welcome  
**[0:31:58-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:31:58):**  on the farm. And so we're doing work to try and go to these communities and talk to them  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:02):**  and find out, well, what would make them welcome? And you know, even things like the signage  
**[0:32:06-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:06):**  was, you know, felt like they felt the signage wasn't, didn't apply to them. It applied  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:09):**  to other people, but not them. And so how do we change the signage? How do we get people  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:13):**  who work in the farm to better represent the community?  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:16):**  Jason Vale, Theatrical Director, St Wurberg's City Farms, You co-founded the British Veterinary  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:22):**  Ethnicity and Diversity Society. What are you hoping that that society is going to achieve?  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:27):**  I want real change. That's what I want to achieve. I want to see positive action. So  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:32):**  when we started, it was more about awareness. You know, people didn't believe that racism  
**[0:32:37-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:37):**  existed and people didn't take any, you know, the one or two experiences that came out,  
**[0:32:42-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:42):**  people didn't take it seriously. They felt it was a one-off. So when I started, it was  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:45):**  about why are the children not, why are the children from diverse backgrounds not applying  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:49):**  for vet school? Why are the vets not representing the population? And it started awareness and  
**[0:32:55-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:55):**  then it moved on to action. You know, okay, you're aware there's racism, what are we going  
**[0:32:58-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:32:58):**  to do about it? So at the moment, we're working with universities on wider participation and  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:03):**  on inclusivity in the vet schools. And we're working with different bodies in the industry.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:09):**  You know, how are we going to get more VME vets to become farm vets or become equine  
**[0:33:13-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:13):**  vets or how are we going to get people to stay in the industry or how are we going to  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:16):**  get those voices out there? So, you know, working and working with nurses and making  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:20):**  sure it's more inclusive that way. So I think there's the thing with children and encouraging  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:24):**  them and there's a thing with students and making sure they feel included at vet school  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:28):**  and have the best experience. And then there's the thing with the vets in practice.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:31):**  Bushra, what are your priorities as Vice Chair of the BAME Ecologist Network?  
**[0:33:35-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:35):**  We've only been going since October 2020. So we're not even that old of a network yet,  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:40):**  but we are growing exponentially and it's very clear this is something that people really  
**[0:33:44-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:44):**  desire, which is fantastic, the amount of response we're having. So our initial work  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:48):**  is really to help identify these barriers, much like Theva's already done within the  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:53):**  society. So, yeah, we're really trying to identify these barriers within ecology. We're  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:33:58):**  also hoping that the network forms a net to retain any talent so that we're not losing  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:03):**  all these talented people within ecology because they're not feeling included. We can provide  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:08):**  them with support. So mentoring is another thing we're planning on providing. Mentorship  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:13):**  is really, really beneficial. It's actually how Theban I know each other is because he's  
**[0:34:18-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:18):**  been my mentor as part of the Black British STEM scheme. And I especially benefited from  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:23):**  having someone who's not just in the agricultural industry, but someone who is a person of colour  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:28):**  so that they can understand my experiences, my imposter syndrome. And I think that is  
**[0:34:33-0:34:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:33):**  a really, really important and valuable thing to have. So we're really hoping to create  
**[0:34:37-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:37):**  a pool of mentors available for whatever stage people's career paths are, whether or not  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:42):**  they're a postdoc or whether they're an undergraduate or perhaps just looking to do ecology at university.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:48):**  Also, again, really important on representation. We really want to change the idea that a zoologist  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:54):**  is David Attenborough. Like, we really want to change that mindset that you have to be  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:34:59):**  a middle class white man to go into these kind of industries. And I think, yeah, this  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:04):**  is where we're really starting to identify the barriers. And we'll really be looking  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:08):**  at how we can decolonise ecology as a whole and decolonise academia, which I know are  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:13):**  very big themes for a lot of people at the moment. But it's really important that we  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:17):**  identify ways to do that. And actually, the pandemic has been a really good way for us  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:23):**  to help see some of those areas. So quite often for natural sciences, you would send  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:28):**  a team of researchers or you would go yourself to another country to do the research to find  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:34):**  the resources. Whereas because of the pandemic, what researchers were forced to do is to give  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:40):**  the information to locals, train them up as local ecologists. And therefore, you've not  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:45):**  only just got yourself a new pool of international ecologists, you've potentially inspired a  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:49):**  whole community of people to go into a different career path. So yeah, really trying to find  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:54):**  these ways that we can decolonise ecology and make it more accessible.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:35:57):**  Both, thank you so much for sharing your experiences and your thoughts and ideas for how we can  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:36:04):**  actually bring about and embed some real change in this country. And I'm sure many of those  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:36:09):**  ideas can be replicated around the world. Well, that's all we have time for. It's been  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Diversity-in-agriculture--animal-sciences-et806l#t=0:36:14):**  a truly fascinating insight. I'd like to thank my guests Bushra Abu-Hilil and Navaratnam

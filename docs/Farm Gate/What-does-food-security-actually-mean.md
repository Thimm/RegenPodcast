### Farm Gate  (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 10:45:38)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Logue-Kustain.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:09):**  Food security is a hot topic. Suddenly coronavirus has placed it at the top of people's minds.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:15):**  But for many years, the issue has been much lower on the public agenda, perhaps because  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:20):**  some NGOs and policy advocates felt squeamish about the nationalism and the focus on volume  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:26):**  that older definitions of food security seem to imply. But has food security ever just  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:31):**  been about calories and commodity? And if it was, isn't it time that we redefined  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:36):**  food security for the modern world, recognising the essential role that land use, food system  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:42):**  resilience and nutrition play in ensuring that not only our own citizens, but citizens  
**[0:00:48-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:48):**  around the world can eat and eat well. In this programme, I'll speak to three food  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:53):**  system experts. Later, I'll talk to Vicky Hurd from Sustain and Tim Benton from Chatham  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:00:58):**  House. But first of all, I asked Patrick Holden, the chief executive of the Sustainable Food  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:03):**  Trust, the apparently simple question, what is food security?  
**[0:01:07-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:07):**  Patrick Holden, Chief Executive of the Sustainable Food Trust, Sustain  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:09):**  It's a simple question, but a very important one. I would define it very broadly as the  
**[0:01:14-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:14):**  capacity of a population to feed itself in a reliable and sustainable way. And in so  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:21):**  doing to withstand external shocks to the system. So I suppose I would include the word  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:27):**  resilience into the definition of food security. And as we all know from recent developments  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:32):**  with the pandemic, external shocks can easily threaten food supplies or even induce a fear  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:38):**  that the food supplies might be threatened. So I think that the definition of food security  
**[0:01:43-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:43):**  needs to include the capacity to withstand these changing external conditions and still  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:48):**  be able to feed ourselves in a reliable way.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:51):**  World Finance Right at the beginning of what you were saying  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:53):**  there, you talked about feeding ourselves well. And within that, nutrition and good  
**[0:01:59-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:01:59):**  food must come into place. It's not just about calories.  
**[0:02:02-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:02):**  Patrick Holden, Chief Executive of the Sustainable Food Trust, Sustain  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:03):**  No, of course. And really, it's implicit, but maybe needs to be explicit in the definition,  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:08):**  that maintaining the health of a population means positive health. Not just keeping people  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:14):**  alive, but actually keeping people in a state where they can withstand external disease  
**[0:02:19-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:19):**  challenges and remain really healthy. So absolutely, health and nutritional quality is part of  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:25):**  the food security equation.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:26):**  World Finance Do you think the definition has changed?  
**[0:02:28-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:28):**  Patrick Holden, Chief Executive of the Sustainable Food Trust, Sustain  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:29):**  Well, I think it's evolving. But you mentioned the Second World War, and the lessons we can  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:33):**  learn from history. And I'm told that the health of the public was greater and more  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:39):**  vibrant than ever before, during the dig for victory phase, where people actually had to  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:45):**  be more self-sufficient. Many of my parents' generation had victory gardens, grew their  
**[0:02:50-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:50):**  own vegetables, and changed their diets. And of course, the change probably was manifested  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:02:56):**  in much more fresh and wholesome food, and the result was better health. So I heard the  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:02):**  other day of – dare I call him a crackpot – but a person in the Treasury who suggested  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:07):**  that food security for the United Kingdom was just about sourcing food from the other  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:12):**  side of the world, or wherever it was cheapest to produce. Well, I think we now can realise  
**[0:03:17-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:17):**  that actually what, for me at any rate, food security represents is the capacity of my  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:23):**  household to source its staple foods in a reliable way from producers who are farming  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:29):**  near to me, who depend on me, and who know that I depend on them. And that's a beautiful  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:34):**  and mutually beneficial relationship. Because then, come tempest and storm, I can go to  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:39):**  them, preferably even I can reach them if I need to, on foot. That would be the ideal  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:44):**  relationship, and be able to obtain my secure and resilient food supplies from them. Now,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:49):**  in the case of a city like London, with a food footprint spanning probably a lot of  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:55):**  England and maybe a bit of Wales as well, from where I'm speaking to you, you can't  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:03:59):**  expect all the citizens of London to buy their vegetables from, you know, within 10 miles  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:04):**  of where they live. But that said, my daughter Alice is working for growing communities,  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:09):**  growing organic vegetables in Dagenham. And I think one of the most inspiring aspects  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:15):**  of growing communities is that they have a policy of building relationships with peri-urban  
**[0:04:21-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:21):**  farms around the perimeter of London and saying to those farmers, look, we will buy all your  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:26):**  product, whatever it is, and it's probably a range of different products if they're farming  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:29):**  in a sustainable way. And you will know that you would have guaranteed market for your  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:34):**  outlet for your food come hell or high water, in this case coronavirus. And that way you  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:41):**  build food security for the citizens of London. Well, now what a brilliant idea and may it  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:46):**  grow to proper scale. I wonder if food security actually means doing slightly different things  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:50):**  in different places. And we've talked before about, you know, the localisation of supply,  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:55):**  you were talking about it there. And I know that, you know, we've had conversations in  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:04:59):**  the past about how difficult it can be for people to identify sustainable food when they  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:05):**  go shopping in major retailers. Now, you mentioned the Dig for Victory campaign, people growing  
**[0:05:10-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:10):**  food in their own back gardens. And I wonder if you feel in terms of easing some of that  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:16):**  pressure on bigger population centres like London or Birmingham, that actually there's  
**[0:05:22-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:22):**  an ongoing duty for people in more rural environments who have their own gardens to put aside a  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:29):**  little bit of it and actually use it to grow some of the food they eat.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:32):**  Absolutely. And what a wonderful thing that would happen, not just in gardens, but in  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:37):**  parks and of course, the incredible edible initiative that Pam Wadhurst is leading, where  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:42):**  we start to look at open spaces which have been grassed over or growing kind of useless  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:47):**  shrubs which probably aren't even very good for biodiversity, and instead thinking of  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:52):**  them as potentially food producing areas. So certainly, I believe that the current coronavirus  
**[0:05:59-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:05:59):**  pandemic is going to precipitate a great surge of new interest in growing your own food and  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:06):**  increasing one's level of self-sufficiency in relation to vegetables and fruits that  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:11):**  one can grow in one's garden and therefore achieve a greater degree of resilience in  
**[0:06:17-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:17):**  one's food supply.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:18):**  Now, Patrick, you'll know there are competing visions of what food security means and I  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:23):**  think, you know, I've come across conversations recently where people have been coming back  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:27):**  to price, back to volume and commoditisation that the way that we deliver food security  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:33):**  is by keeping prices low for the poorest, by making sure that we produce lots of key  
**[0:06:39-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:39):**  commodities in whatever way is necessary.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:42):**  Well, I think I do agree that we need affordable food, but the present food pricing system  
**[0:06:48-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:48):**  is dishonest because the prices we pay in the shops do not reflect the true cost of  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:53):**  production or its impact on natural capital, on pollution, on climate change, etc. And  
**[0:06:59-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:06:59):**  it seems to me that we need to correct those distortions and have honestly priced food  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:03):**  and that should be part of the move towards greater food security. And of course, until  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:08):**  we have that, it's very difficult for our own farmers to compete with imports produced  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:14):**  to lower standards. So this really needs to be wrapped up in a strategy to increase the  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:20):**  degree of genuine food security for this nation and to make sure that the prices we pay for  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:27):**  our food honestly reflect their environmental and human impacts. And if we did all that  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:33):**  and the polluter paid and we redirected the subsidies, which are currently really a social  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:38):**  security check for farmers and made sure that they were conditional on producing high quality  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:43):**  food for local populations, then the world will be a better place and we would have a  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:48):**  much greater degree of food security.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:50):**  And food security sort of expands from the immediate day to day. I mean, we're talking  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:07:56):**  in the context of the coronavirus pandemic and, you know, my own experience, I'm sure  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:01):**  we've all had experiences of things that we wanted or needed to get in the supermarket,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:04):**  which just aren't available. And so it's coping with those day to day aspects of people being  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:10):**  able to feed themselves well, but then making sure that over time the land becomes more  
**[0:08:15-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:15):**  resilient so that we can predict with confidence that there will be greater food security in  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:22):**  the future because our land has become more resilient.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:24):**  Yes. I mean, it's very interesting you make the point about current shortages of food  
**[0:08:29-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:29):**  due to a combination of hoarding and genuine scarcity. But even for the movement towards  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:37):**  greater food security that we are discussing, the pandemic is pretty disruptive. Just taking  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:42):**  our own farm as a case study, we produce a cheese which has been going to restaurants  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:48):**  and to destination cheese shops and some has been going to export. And all three of those  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:08:54):**  markets have suffered in the pandemic. And as a result of the huge concentration that  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:01):**  most of the successful online retailers are placing on just getting the staples through  
**[0:09:06-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:06):**  to their customers, products like our cheese are definitely not in the equation. So we're  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:12):**  looking at a 50% reduction in the sale of Havon cheese as a result of the pandemic.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:17):**  And we don't know when that's going to come right. And it's not because people don't want  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:21):**  our cheese. It's just that we don't have the channels to get it to people that want it.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:24):**  So this is a really interesting reappraisal. And what I hope will happen is that the reappraisal  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:30):**  will take into account the relocalisation of sustainably produced food rather than just  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:36):**  go to a sort of military style, large scale sourcing exercise, which is probably currently  
**[0:09:42-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:42):**  dominating the government's minds.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:45):**  Patrick Holden from the Sustainable Food Trust, talking about shortening supply chains and  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:50):**  the importance of embedding food production at the heart of all of our communities.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:09:55):**  Fikki Hurd is the sustainable farming coordinator at Sustain. I asked her whether food security  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:00):**  should centre on availability and volume or be more strongly focused on quality and nutrition.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:06):**  We've got to really get away from the idea it's amount of calories and that's all that  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:11):**  matters. It's like the equivalent of GDP being an assessment of our wellbeing. Neither is  
**[0:10:16-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:16):**  appropriate because we need a range of nutritional elements to make sure we've got a good diet  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:22):**  and people have different needs at different parts of their lives and depending on what  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:26):**  their activities are. So we've got to move away from it being about calories and just  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:30):**  about money to being about people having control over what they buy and what they have access  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:35):**  to. So having some agency is very important as well. So some people use the term food  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:40):**  sovereignty, which is a very good one about having the control over whether you can produce  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:44):**  your own food or you can actually access your own food and your food being nutritionally  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:49):**  appropriate, culturally appropriate for you. And that also, food sovereignty is also about  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:53):**  farmers having control over their livelihoods and what happens to the food that they produce.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:10:58):**  Over the course of the last couple of decades, my own sort of feeling, my own understanding  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:02):**  of food security feels like it's changed. And I'm not sure whether that's just me and  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:06):**  other people within the food community or whether it's sort of society more broadly.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:11):**  How do you think public perceptions of food security have changed over the last few decades?  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:15):**  Oh, well, that's an interesting question. I think it's still seen by some as purely  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:21):**  a matter of can we afford to buy food wherever it's from. And I think there's certain elements  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:25):**  of our political class, you know, the politicians who still believe that's good enough. But  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:30):**  I think communities are getting very much more involved in what their food is about,  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:35):**  where it's from, how it's grown, how healthy it is. We run something called the Sustainable  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:38):**  Food Cities Network and that's a movement. It's growing rapidly and it's very much about  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:43):**  people having interest in food at a local level. And that means food security. It means  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:48):**  food health, food sustainability, tackling the climate and nature emergency. And so that's  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:54):**  all the way from local to regional, to national, to global thinking about food security and  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:11:59):**  a whole section. I think there's also been a huge amount of information and campaigns  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:04):**  around the impact of our consumption on the global commons and rainforests being destroyed  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:09):**  to produce beef and soya and palm oil. All these things are beginning to get understood  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:14):**  by people and particularly the younger generation. And they understand some of these global food  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:19):**  challenges. Let's come back to the sort of global picture  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:22):**  in just a moment. But I'm reminded as you talk that when I was given evidence at the  
**[0:12:27-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:27):**  Agriculture Bill Committee just recently, as I know you did as well, I think it was  
**[0:12:31-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:31):**  a Labour MP that asked me about food security and about the impact of changes around agricultural  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:39):**  policy, the changes they were going to have on food prices and about the importance of  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:43):**  making sure that everybody could afford to eat. I guess my own response was that food  
**[0:12:48-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:48):**  security isn't just about price. It's about making sure that we manage our land well.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:53):**  How do we separate out those different ideas? To be honest, I think it'd be very, very unlikely  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:12:59):**  for politicians not to focus every time on the price issue. It's the one thing about  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:05):**  food that always gets politicians excited and it was ever thus. We could try and you're  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:12):**  absolutely right. It is about so much more than that. And the reality is for the majority  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:17):**  of people who find they can't afford to eat well or to eat, or to eat the kind of things  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:23):**  they want to eat, it's because they haven't got the incomes or they haven't got a car  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:28):**  to go to the shop. So we're very much focusing on tackling the drivers of people being in  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:33):**  poverty or not able to afford the kind of things they need. And it's to do with housing  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:38):**  costs, it's to do with poor welfare situation, it's to do with poor incomes, zero hours contracts.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:44):**  All those things are very much at the heart of food prices being a problem. Because as  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:49):**  we know, in the UK we've got the cheapest foods across Europe. And so making it any  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:13:56):**  cheaper would be very much leading us down towards more intensive and more harmful farm  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:02):**  practices, which we know we don't need because that's very much a problem in the long term  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:07):**  in terms of climate change, soil loss, biodiversity loss, and our ability to feed ourselves.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:12):**  I think what you're saying is that the two are kind of separate, that we need to deal  
**[0:14:17-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:17):**  with poverty with one strategy, and then redefine food security so that we understand that it's  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:23):**  different from poverty. Poverty is a whole different social construct or result of policies  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:31):**  that we need to address in a different way.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:34):**  There are issues around planning and availability of food that really need to be considered  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:39):**  as well here though, the availability of fresh produce on the high street, having those kind  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:44):**  of issues dealt with. So we don't want to lose sight of the fact that people need to  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:48):**  have access to food, wherever they are, whatever their income. But yes, I think definitely  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:53):**  keeping it separate in terms of policy responses to farming.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:14:56):**  If we were looking ahead and we're sort of recognising that there is a degree to which  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:02):**  in the past food security has been synonymous with calories, with volume, with an intensification  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:09):**  of agriculture. If you were looking forward 20 years to what food security should look  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:14):**  like on the ground from your perspective, what are the big key changes?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:19):**  That's a great question. That whole food system vision is what you're asking for. And I think  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:25):**  a good word to describe, well two words to describe it would be more diverse and sustainable.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:30):**  And there's so many things within that. But if you think about diversity on the farm,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:34):**  so we're diversifying the cropping and the livestock so that they're better fitted to  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:38):**  the carrying capacity of the soil, of the land, of the microclimate. And making sure  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:43):**  that all fits together by having a more diverse cropping system and rotations, et cetera.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:48):**  But it's also about a more diverse supply chain and a more diverse retail opportunity.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:15:55):**  And we're very interested in 20 years' time, it would be fantastic to see real inroads  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:02):**  by better food trading initiatives so that farmers can actually trade their food either  
**[0:16:07-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:07):**  directly to consumers or through traders that are going to pay fairly. And that's made of  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:13):**  massive inroads. I mean if it all came out in 20 years' time I'd like to see 50% of the  
**[0:16:17-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:17):**  food retailed through new forms of retail, all food service sector, compared to now where  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:23):**  the bulk of it is sold through a very small handful of extremely powerful retailers.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:29):**  So greater complexity, greater diversity.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:31):**  More complexity and actually bringing it more local and regional where that's appropriate.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:36):**  So yeah, getting people closer to the food that they eat where it makes sense. Obviously  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:42):**  we're still going to be importing things and getting things from long distance, but it  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:46):**  should be focused more on the regional and local.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:49):**  Through the conversation we've been talking about food security in terms of food availability,  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:54):**  the amount of food that is there, making sure, you know, different strategies, different  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:16:57):**  approaches to making sure that food is there. But do you think, you know, if we're talking  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:02):**  about food security and breaking apart that phrase a little bit, can you see in the future  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:06):**  if we fail to tackle climate change, if we fail to arrest the degradation of biodiversity,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:12):**  but disruptions to food supplies, that a lack of resilience in our food system could actually  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:19):**  lead to physical security issues, you know, in our own country and around the world?  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:24):**  I think that's absolutely right. I mean, we're talking more and more about resilience. And  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:29):**  if we've disrupted natural systems globally so much that we increasingly seen a rise in  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:36):**  zoonoses, a real crisis in terms of climate change, and that can be at local as well as  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:42):**  national levels, as we're seeing with the Amazon, you know, it's potentially releasing  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:46):**  more comdioxide now than it's taking in, which is an extraordinary situation and it's largely  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:50):**  to do with our food supply. So if we don't tackle those things, if we don't tackle climate  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:54):**  change and the nature emergency, and that's a lot, you know, it's very much to do with  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:17:59):**  land use and particularly in relation to biodiversity. If we don't do that, we will increasingly  
**[0:18:04-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:04):**  seeing big threats to our supply of nutritional security. I think that's absolutely right.  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:10):**  So we've got to tackle those with the great urgency, which is why in climate talks and  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:14):**  in the negotiations, land use and food has got higher up the agenda, but it's very political.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:20):**  Vicky heard from Sustain, explaining that diversity, both in terms of food production  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:25):**  and the meals we choose to eat, is critical to developing greater resilience in our food  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:31):**  systems. Professor Tim Benton, the director of energy, environment and resources at Chatham  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:36):**  House has been working on food security for many years. I asked him about his day to day  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:41):**  working definition.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:43):**  The shorthand definition I use is access to a healthy diet for a healthy life.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:48):**  What you've said there about health and a healthy life is really interesting because  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:52):**  I think there has been a concern from many within the NGO community that traditionally  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:18:59):**  food security has been focused on volume and therefore has been used as an excuse for greater  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:05):**  intensification of agriculture.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:07):**  Yes, I think broadly in the sense that the food system that we have now on a global basis  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:15):**  has largely been designed on the notion that there hasn't been enough food in the world  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:20):**  and it dates back to post Second World War, economic reconstruction, lots of starving  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:27):**  people. How do we get economies going? How do we drive things forward? How do we drive  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:32):**  down the price of food so that people have got more money to spend on other things that  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:36):**  can drive economies forward? And all of that has led to, through the Green Revolution,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:41):**  through the liberalisation of trade, to this overall notion that food is largely about  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:46):**  calories and filling our stomachs up. Food should be as cheap as possible and the health  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:51):**  impacts of the production of that food and the environmental impacts of the production  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:19:55):**  of that food are less important than the producing at large volumes and at cheap price. And of  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:01):**  course, that leads to a whole lot of other notions. The more we concentrate on cheaper  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:06):**  food traded internationally, the more we've squeezed down from a very large number of  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:12):**  crops down to the basic eight or so that provide three quarters of the world calories. Everybody's  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:17):**  eating more or less the same thing. It's very rich in calories. It's poor in nutrients.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:22):**  The diseases associated with having access to too many calories are becoming prevalent  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:27):**  all over the world. Non-communicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease arising from  
**[0:20:33-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:33):**  complications coming out of obesity. So, we have taken our eye off the ball too much and  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:39):**  defined the point of agriculture as producing cheap calories. And I think the whole notion  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:45):**  of food security in terms of, as I framed it, about a healthy diet for a healthy life  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:50):**  implies that we should be focusing on nutrition, putting people at the heart of our notions  
**[0:20:56-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:20:56):**  of food security and the all people at all times by definition includes future generations.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:02):**  So, you know, getting people right, you know, people's diets right for a healthy life, but  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:08):**  in a sustainable way so that in 50 years time, children, particularly in vulnerable countries,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:13):**  are not going to be disadvantaged even more by climate change driven by our current climate  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:18):**  and lack of biodiversity and poor soil quality, etc.  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:21):**  You've linked their food security to the, over the last decades, the commoditisation,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:27):**  the over commoditisation of food. And I think the suggestion there is that food security  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:32):**  needs to be as much about quality as it is about commodity and the health aspect really  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:38):**  needs to be front and centre as we move forwards. And I'm interested that there has been, you  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:44):**  know, even when I talk about this amongst colleagues, there is a certain squeamishness,  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:48):**  particularly, you know, if I would frame it this way from colleagues who were perhaps  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:53):**  on the centre or left of centre around the idea of food security, that it's somehow not  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:21:59):**  only that it's associated with this commoditisation and intensification of production, but also  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:04):**  that it's a little bit, they're a bit squeamish around the nationalism of the food security  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:09):**  conversation. And equally, when I talk to other people, perhaps on the right of that  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:14):**  argument, there is quite a quick response and a quick assumption that food security  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:19):**  is about how we keep the nation fed in a very kind of World War Two fashion.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:24):**  Only in some circumstances, such as we might be entering now with COVID or a war situation,  
**[0:22:31-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:31):**  is there a mapping of food security on a national basis to self-sufficiency. Those are typically  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:38):**  two very, very different notions. And they get confused in multiple ways. And there are  
**[0:22:44-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:44):**  kind of contested bits in that, of course, different parts of the industry want to privilege  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:50):**  their parts of the supply chain for guaranteed markets and so on. So I think there's a whole  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:22:54):**  host of things in that. From the, yeah, there is also therefore a degree of kind of nationalistic  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:01):**  or populistic thinking within that. I think from the left, the more squeamishness, and  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:06):**  it's also reflected in the right, but for different reasons, is the relationship between  
**[0:23:11-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:11):**  healthy diets, sustainable diets, food price, and broadly food poverty. Food should be as  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:18):**  cheap as possible. And as I mentioned earlier, the reasons for that are that by making food  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:23):**  as cheap as possible, you have other money to spend on other things that will drive the  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:27):**  economy forward. But it has become so deeply ingrained that politicians see cheaper food  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:33):**  as the necessity. And if cheaper food comes at the cost of healthcare subsidy or environmental  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:40):**  costs and environmental subsidy, then that is just how it has to be. And my own view  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:46):**  is that we should divorce the issue of poverty from the issue of food price and recognize  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:51):**  that food price at the moment externalizes too much and food prices should rise, but  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:23:56):**  we should allow poor people to get out of poverty and we should tackle that as a separate  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:01):**  issue and not say we have to subsidize food prices in the name of the poor, because the  
**[0:24:06-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:06):**  only way for that is to make it worse as time goes on.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:10):**  I wonder if we're looking at the way that food security should be defined or framed  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:16):**  in the future, whether we need to find a way of bundling in some of those additional costs  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:22):**  when we're talking about food security so that food security becomes about better land  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:26):**  use, better health, at the same time as hearing what you say about separating out the conversation  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:31):**  about food prices from the issue of food security itself.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:36):**  Yeah, the way I would frame it would be we want to make our food system as productive  
**[0:24:43-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:43):**  as possible, not that we need to dance on the head of a pin about the definition of  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:48):**  food security, because I do think it implicitly deals with sustainable production and healthy  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:54):**  production. But the reason I say food system productivity is that we have focused so much  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:24:59):**  on agricultural productivity and yields and food prices. What we've done is we have created  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:05):**  a whole set of interlocking vicious circles that actually make our food system horribly  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:12):**  inefficient. And what I mean by that is that food is so freely available and it's so cheap,  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:18):**  it's economically rational to waste it. To make food that cheap, we have concentrated  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:22):**  on a few crops growing at enormous scale with very high biodiversity loss, which are very  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:27):**  fragile to climate change and other interruptions. As we think about the future and the impact  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:33):**  of climate change and other interruptions, we're saying, oh, we've got to intensify more  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:36):**  to make more food more cheaply that we can overeat and throw away and makes us into a  
**[0:25:42-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:42):**  poor social state and drive our healthcare issues into bankruptcy. So instead of thinking  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:49):**  about how do we produce food as much as possible, as cheap as possible, that we can then throw  
**[0:25:53-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:53):**  away that whose production has an environmental cost that we can overeat and that overeating  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:25:59):**  has a healthcare cost. Instead of doing that, we can think about how do we make our food  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:05):**  system productive in terms of feeding people as the top of the sum and then underneath  
**[0:26:11-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:11):**  the divisor feeding people, how do we minimise the traditional inputs, labour capital, synthetic  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:19):**  inputs, the natural capital, the waste of soil, the loss of biodiversity, the climate  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:23):**  change inputs, and how do we minimise the healthcare subsidy. And if you take that sum  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:29):**  of what a productive food system is, that's equivalent to how do we feed people healthily,  
**[0:26:34-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:34):**  sustainably per unit input rather than how do we grow as much as possible per unit input.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:40):**  And if we just framed the food system in that way, it would imply a completely different  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:44):**  set of policy interventions. It would apply a more diverse food system. It would imply  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:48):**  a less wasteful food system, more interconnected livestock and arable farming, more complex  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:54):**  rotations. We would waste less food. There'd be less demand on the land. We could afford  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:26:59):**  to use some of the land for carbon dioxide removal. We could have a more diverse landscape  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:04):**  with much richer biodiversity, et cetera, et cetera. So just simply by framing the food  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:09):**  system in terms of people fed healthily per unit input and sustainably, you end up with  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:13):**  a completely different policy space than how do we actually just increase yields as much  
**[0:27:18-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:18):**  as we possibly can.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:19):**  World Finance, professor Tim Benton from Chatham House. Framing is incredibly important. How  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:25):**  we choose to define a question will nearly always shape the conclusions that we reach.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:30):**  And I confess, I've been a little concerned by the way in which coronavirus has been used  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:34):**  recently by some commentators to try and reframe the issue of food security, just to sharpen  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:40):**  the focus on issues they already perennially campaign on. The current pandemic is a massive  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:45):**  shock to our food system, not to mention our society and the overall economy. But it doesn't  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:51):**  suddenly eliminate the enormous pressures from other threats to our food infrastructure  
**[0:27:55-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:27:55):**  that have become more substantial as the decades have passed. Climate change, biodiversity  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:28:01):**  loss, soil health, people trained to behave as consumers rather than citizens, the loss  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:28:06):**  of local infrastructure, and our reliance on vulnerable global supply chains.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:28:11):**  In my view, we need to do some serious work. Not only to define and describe the issue  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:28:17):**  of food security, using the frames described by my guests, but to consider the multitude  
**[0:28:22-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:28:22):**  of threats we face, and the variety of human behaviours and reactions that may manifest  
**[0:28:27-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-does-food-security-actually-mean-ecg6b2#t=0:28:27):**  in response to coming crises.

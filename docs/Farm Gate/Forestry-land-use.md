### Farm Gate  (Thu, 24 Mar 2022 12:54:57)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to FarmGate. I'm Finn LoKusteyn, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:09):**  of the Food and Global Security Network. In this programme, we're talking trees. Demand  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:15):**  for new woodland is growing for everything from timber to carbon sequestration. But forests  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:20):**  take up space and competition for land is increasing. How do we balance the demands  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:25):**  of food production, nature, housing and infrastructure with the need for new woodland and forest  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:30):**  products? And is it time at last for a joined-up land use strategy for the UK and for other  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:36):**  places around the world? I'm joined by Andrew Heald, a consultant specialising in sustainable  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:41):**  forests and plantations, and by Martin Lines, the Chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome both. Hello. Hi, good morning Finno. Good morning, Martin. Andy, let's start with  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:52):**  a simple question. What do we need wood and woodland for? Well, I think we need trees,  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:57):**  more trees and more woodland in our landscapes for lots of different reasons, whether that's  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:00):**  for biodiversity or habitat connection, for carbon sequestration, to provide shelter for  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:06):**  livestock on farms or protect rivers from runoff or to shade those rivers. There's  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:10):**  an interesting initiative in Scotland called Riverwoods looking at shading of rivers and  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:15):**  how important that is for salmonid stocks. More woodlands and more trees can have an  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:19):**  impact around soil erosion and they're nice places to walk, to run or just to sit and  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:24):**  contemplate life in. And of course, I'm really interested in those woodlands and forests  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:29):**  from a timber and a fibre perspective and how we use that timber and fibre to decarbonise  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:34):**  a lot of what we do in our economies. It's interesting, isn't it? Because, you know,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:38):**  the countryside, whether it's farmland or whether it's woodland, there is this competition,  
**[0:01:43-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:43):**  you know, for different sort of functions, whether it, you know, there's the economic  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:46):**  functions but also the wellbeing functions. And at this point in time, particularly after  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:50):**  COVID over the last couple of years, that wellbeing, that sort of amenity element is  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:55):**  critically important.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:56):**  Yeah, no, I think so. And I think anyone managing the countryside where there's easy access  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:01):**  has seen a huge boom in the number of people turning up and how we manage that impact.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:06):**  And different forest management types or different farmers are able to cope with that differently.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:10):**  Obviously, there's been a huge increase in negative impacts of people accessing the countryside,  
**[0:02:15-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:15):**  but there is that demand. And I think a lot of people have rediscovered the kind of countryside  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:19):**  on their doorstep. And I don't think that demand is going to go away. And I think we  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:22):**  need to think carefully about how we manage that land and how we work with landowners  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:27):**  and land managers to kind of increase the positive aspects of that and reduce the negative  
**[0:02:31-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:31):**  aspects. I think woodland does soak up a lot of access pressure managed in the right way.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:35):**  And I think we're going to come on to quite a few of those issues because there was lots  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:38):**  in what you just said there, and we'll start to unpack that as we go forward. But before  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:42):**  we do, I just want to ask you about different forestry mixes because, of course, different  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:46):**  forestry mixes serve different outcomes. And I wonder if you could talk us through some  
**[0:02:51-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:51):**  of the different types of woodland that we might encounter and what the trees that grow  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:55):**  in them might be used for.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:57):**  I think we'll need a longer podcast for that. I think we also spend a lot of time kind of  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:02):**  labelling woodland types and woodland management practices. And sometimes those labels aren't  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:08):**  helpful, but I tend to think of different outcomes of woodland management and kind of  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:12):**  work backwards from there. So if you're interested in woodlands for biodiversity and particularly  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:18):**  managing biodiversity that likes open space and edges within woodland, then you could  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:22):**  have a coppice woodland, a coppice broadleaf woodland. If perhaps your objective is growing  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:27):**  saw logs for UK construction, then you can perhaps be growing more conifers rather than  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:31):**  broadleaves and thinning them over a longer rotation so that well-thinned managed conifer  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:36):**  woodland. And I think sometimes we tend to reduce things often to oversimplify kind of  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:41):**  woodland management. So we can and do and should be managing broadleaf native woodland  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:45):**  for timber and we should be managing and we can and should also be managing pine plantations  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:51):**  for biodiversity. And then there's this huge everything in between. The other complication  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:56):**  or other added level of interest is that sometimes what you're managing woodland for, part of  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:02):**  a woodland for and the outcomes will change over time. So say in a conifer forest, you  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:08):**  might have a restock site within that conifer forest that might be really good for night  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:12):**  jar and black grouse because the area is clear, it's got shelter and that's good for that  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:16):**  habitat. But then the crops close and it becomes less good for those species. And that's just  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:20):**  like in a, and that cycle starts in another part of the forest. That's just like a broadleaf  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:25):**  coppice woodland where a broadleaf coppice woodland is good, really good for woodland  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:29):**  flora and biodiversity and butterflies in that when you have that, it's just been felled  
**[0:04:34-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:34):**  and it's open. And then that woodland changes over time. I think similarly a lot of the  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:37):**  1960s and 70s plantation forestry we had were planted with a particular outcome or aspect  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:43):**  of pulp and paper and obviously the sort of famously growing pit props for the coal industry.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:49):**  They weren't thought about as, we weren't thinking about mass timber or bioplastics  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:53):**  or the wider bioeconomy. So I think that's that challenge of everything from native wild  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:57):**  woodland to intensively managed plantations. But those intensively managed plantations  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:01):**  could be a wide range of species. So that's what makes woodland and forestry just like  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:05):**  farming and agriculture. It covers such a wide range of habitat types and outcomes.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:11):**  And just to clear something up before we get any further, because you've told me off in  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:16):**  the past when I've misrepresented Sitka spruce, for example, and you said, don't talk about  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:20):**  Sitka spruce when you're talking about carbon sequestration, because that's not what it's  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:24):**  called. Carbon sequestration, you know, it's through broadleaf woodland instead. Is that  
**[0:05:28-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:28):**  right? Let's just be clear before we get any further.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:31):**  Sitka spruce sequesters carbon. That's the sequestering carbon is what turns CO2 in the  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:36):**  atmosphere into wood, into timber, into stuff. And generally if people are planting conifers,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:42):**  then they're planting a crop and it's that crop to be harvested. So that crop is sequestered  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:48):**  carbon. It's stored carbon. But you're planting it for a different, for a range of different  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:52):**  purposes. So if people are planting spruce, it's because they want to grow a crop of spruce,  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:57):**  which might be used for a range of products from timber and construction to wooden pallets,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:01):**  to fencing, to some paper products and everything in between.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:04):**  So of course, whichever trees you're planting, they are sequestering carbon from the atmosphere,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:09):**  as you said then. But if we're looking at planting trees and growing woodland to locking  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:13):**  carbon in perpetuity, then that is a woodland that's unlikely to be cropped. And actually  
**[0:06:19-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:19):**  it's a woodland that we would expect to be staying there.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:21):**  Again, it depends on your objectives as if you just want to lock up carbon in situ, then  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:27):**  yes, it would probably be an unmanaged or lightly managed broadleaf woodland that's  
**[0:06:32-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:32):**  going to sit there for a long time. Or you could be growing large sequoias and leaving  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:35):**  them there for 1000 years. But arguably what we need to be doing is reducing emissions.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:40):**  That's the big thing we need to do is reduce emissions. And a lot of emissions in the UK  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:44):**  come from the construction sector. And if we were growing more timber and getting more  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:47):**  timber into construction, then we're sequestering carbon in that timber. And then we get the  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:52):**  kind of double benefit of if we're using less concrete and steel and more timber in construction,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:57):**  then there's less emissions from that concrete and steel. So just looking at in situ carbon  
**[0:07:02-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:02):**  stored in the woodland is great. That's kind of only one aspect.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:05):**  That's been a fantastic sort of introduction to the world of forestry and timber. Martin,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:11):**  let's just come over to you. What role does woodland play for you on your farm?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:15):**  So currently not a massive amount. I'm in Caminshire, we haven't got a huge amount of  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:19):**  woodlands on our farm. We have got a bit of what's left of a medieval woodland. And there's  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:25):**  a little bit of coppice in area in there. So we have coppice, a little bit of hazel.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:29):**  And in the past, some of that woodland was removed to gain an area based payment or to  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:34):**  a grassland payment to meet the EU payment structure in cap. We have other trees dotted  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:41):**  along the landscape that provide us firewood and fuel for the winter. But that is changing  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:46):**  and where and how we put trees will change as well.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:50):**  Do you have a plan in place? Are you already starting to plant new trees and take up new  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:54):**  space and think about ways that they integrate within your system?  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:59):**  Very much so. I count a farm as an asset manager. I manage the landscape and I'm trying to get  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:03):**  the best I can from it. We have some fairly productive soils and we can get some good  
**[0:08:07-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:07):**  yields of traditional crops so that I can get a good return there. But I've also got  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:11):**  parts of the farm that lay wetter or not the best soils. So we're already now identifying  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:16):**  a number of areas to restock woodlands, plant new woodland, make some shelter bales as our  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:22):**  wind changes and I've got a lot of development that's going to come around us. How can I  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:26):**  use trees as an actual defence? But it's not just trees, it's hedges and other bits as  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:30):**  well and we can actually just think about as our climate changes, we're seeing more  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:34):**  wind. So can I put hedges and trees in places to slow the flow of air down, which warms  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:39):**  my ground up and makes my crops grow better. I just think it's an integrated process of  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:43):**  how we fit trees into our landscape will be so important in the future and we must be  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:48):**  more open minded in the way we're thinking about it. We've been so siloed in our previous  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:52):**  thinking of what is farming, what is food, what is timber, what is the other goods we  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:56):**  produce.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:57):**  It's interesting because you've already started talking there about the way in which it's  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:01):**  not just land that you've kind of set aside for conservation and nature and then other  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:06):**  land that you're using for farming, but there is this integration and I wonder, you know,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:10):**  just from a, I mean, you mentioned there about air flows and temperatures and windbreaks,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:16):**  but are there other ways that you're able to integrate new trees and hedges with food  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:20):**  production that will help to improve your productivity and profitability?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:24):**  Huge opportunities and the more open minded we are, we can put them in the middle of fields.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:29):**  We can make avenues in Agra forestry and Tulkata, with GPS, they won't be in the way of my modern  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:34):**  machinery and large scale machinery. Then we can add fruit and nuts in, have I got a  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:38):**  local market? What's timber resource I may need in the future? On our own farm, what  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:43):**  can I sell? If we put the right species in hedgerows and the flowering species, there's  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:47):**  increased pollinator and predatory insect benefit. I'm seeing on our own farm, we haven't  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:52):**  needed to use insecticides for nine years, because we deliver habitat and that part of  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:56):**  that is within my hedgerow. So I have a resource of predators and beneficials that can come  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:01):**  and help my crop. But we just need to understand and I need to learn the benefits of all the  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:07):**  different species, habitat and things I can put on the farm and how I can make them all  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:12):**  coexist. And what I'm finding it reduces my overheads, it reduces my costs, and gives  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:17):**  me a more stable output that is particularly as our climate changes that makes my business  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:21):**  more resilient. And by taking those less productive areas out from growing crops, generating income  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:27):**  through habitat, through timber in the future, through other things, that makes my business  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:31):**  more robust and benefiting in the future.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:34):**  So if I play that back a little bit, then there's a degree to which you found over the  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:37):**  last decades that you've been farming, if farmers simply strip away nature in order  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:43):**  to grow a crop, then they've stripped out everything that's going to help them. And  
**[0:10:48-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:48):**  so you end up having to sort of spend money bringing stuff in using chemicals, using insecticides,  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:54):**  because you've taken away the nature that would work for you if it was still there.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:58):**  So by bringing back in trees, by bringing hedgerows back in, by working with nature  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:04):**  and rebalancing that, you're bringing in those natural predators, that natural balance, that  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:09):**  means that it ultimately it saves you quite a lot of money.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:11):**  Yeah. And part of what we're doing as a network, nature means business. Nature gives us free  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:16):**  asset and free availability of sunshine, water and soil. And if we can work with it, we are  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:21):**  not bringing in that artificial resource to compensate for nature. And much of that resource  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:26):**  is a fossil fuel based in fertilizers and sprays in energy and fuel. So why would I  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:32):**  want to be buying something when I can, if I balance it well and get the right output,  
**[0:11:37-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:37):**  it's free, and then I'll get more output. And it is really a different way of thinking.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:40):**  And in the past has always been about focusing on increasing production of single crops,  
**[0:11:45-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:45):**  on a culture that, and the future is this combined landscape use, understanding what  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:51):**  we get and how they all coexist to get better outputs through effort of all the things I  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:57):**  can produce.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:58):**  So Andy, I mean, that must sound like music to your ears in many ways, but you know, in  
**[0:12:03-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:03):**  the last hundred years or so, New Woodland has largely been separated from agriculture.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:08):**  There's been a strategic, that sounds a little grand, a strategic plan, but it sort of ended  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:14):**  up being that trees have been grown specifically for timber products have been produced in  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:19):**  monocultures of one kind and some of them pretty horrendous. And there has been that  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:23):**  sort of sparing approach. And a new report from the Soil Association is calling for what  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:28):**  they call regenerative forestry, a move away from this more traditional sparing way of  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:34):**  doing things where farming, forestry and conservation are done in different places and towards a  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:40):**  sharing approach, which is the kind of thing that both you and Martin have been talking  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:44):**  about with woodlands providing multiple outcomes. So what does regenerative forestry mean to  
**[0:12:50-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:50):**  you and how can we achieve it going forward?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:53):**  Yeah, no, I think it's really interesting and it's exciting to hear what Martin was  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:57):**  saying there. And I think it's easy to look back on kind of forestry and agricultural  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:02):**  practices of 40, 50, 60 years ago and think, why did we do that? And what were the questions,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:08):**  some of the government policies that were driving the kind of post-war intensification  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:12):**  of land use, whether that's Finland, arable agriculture or the planting of the flow countries,  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:17):**  I think it all came from the same place. It was really interesting to read that Soil Association  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:21):**  report and that talk about regenerative forestry and to hear Martin talking about regenerative  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:26):**  farming. And I think it is about taking this, as Martin was saying, it's about taking  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:29):**  a whole systems approach and it's understanding about what aspects of forest management have  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:35):**  the biggest positive impacts and what have the negative impacts, understanding the trade-offs  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:40):**  between the two and sort of working to that. And I think that the report, the one of the  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:45):**  things I really like about the report is the Soil Association have a long history of auditing  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:50):**  forest management in the UK, which perhaps not many people know about. We have a forest  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:55):**  management standard in the UK called AQUAS, UK Woodland Assurance Standard and Soil Association  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:00):**  are one of the main certifying bodies for that standard. So that report is based on  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:04):**  probably about 20 years of auditing experience and talking to a lot of forest managers across  
**[0:14:09-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:09):**  the UK. And the AQUAS standard has been around for about 20 years. It's revised every five  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:14):**  years by a multi-stakeholder group, which includes representatives from RSVP, Woodland  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:19):**  Trust, forestry companies and community woodland groups. So that report on regenerative forestry  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:24):**  is really pulling together a lot of existing really good practice. And I think giving kind  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:28):**  of policy makers a shove in the right direction. And I think we're all facing in the right  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:32):**  direction, but a shove to move faster and quicker. And I think there is that line about  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:38):**  the future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed. There is some really good stuff.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:42):**  There's lots of really good forest management practice and farm management practices going  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:45):**  on. And I think sometimes you just need, everyone needs to be shown. And I don't mean that in  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:50):**  a patronising way, but just go, well, you could do it like this. And this is the benefits  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:55):**  and these are the trade-offs. And I think that report is really good for just opening  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:59):**  everyone's eyes a little bit saying, look, this is what's already occurring. And this  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:02):**  is what we need to be doing a lot more of. And as Martin said, instead of trying to,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:07):**  if you've got areas that aren't growing good crops, then pumping a lot of energy, energy  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:12):**  and input into that land probably isn't a hugely good decision from an environmental  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:17):**  point of view or from an economic point of view.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:19):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:07):**  You know, within that, you're talking about both nudging and frameworks and some of those  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:29):**  nudges and frameworks come from sort of peer to peer information sharing, which I guess  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:35):**  are within that scheme that you were talking about. So there's a huge amount of experience  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:39):**  and knowledge there. Martin, you were wanting to come in.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:41):**  Martin Poulton,  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:42):**  Yeah, I just want to pick up the point. You referenced seeing trees and some of the plants  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:46):**  as monoculture and not being great. We could also look at farming in the same. We see huge  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:51):**  areas of single crops growing on mass areas and mass areas of single species, grasses  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:57):**  and rice, only delivering for output. So I do think we need to rethink our thinking and  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:02):**  what is monoculture? Is it just trees or is it a whole farming system in the way we've  
**[0:16:07-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:07):**  farmed before? And how do we look to go forward in a more systems regenerative way and don't  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:14):**  blame the past but also learn from it and in a more joined up approach as we move forward  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:19):**  and have a rethink on our landscape use and the outputs and how we have a more mixed output  
**[0:16:24-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:24):**  in the future.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:25):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:26):**  I'm glad you came in and said that because I was thinking when Andy said, you know, we're  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:30):**  sort of looking back sort of 50, 60 years to some of the bad practice in the past, I  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:34):**  was kind of thinking you're being very generous there, Andy, certainly in terms of agriculture,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:37):**  because as you say, Martin, there is still a lot of monoculture cropping when it comes  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:42):**  to agriculture particularly. And you know, what's exciting on this podcast is we talk  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:46):**  to so many people who are sort of doing different, who are starting and finding success within  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:52):**  that whole systems approach. Andy, let me come back and say something rude to you and  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:58):**  offer you a chance to kind of address a couple of these things. Now, something that I've  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:01):**  heard people say is that the UK is comparatively small, and we don't necessarily have space  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:07):**  for a lot more forestry. So the first question is, is that true? What's the rebuttal? And  
**[0:17:12-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:12):**  is there a problem with importing timber from places with more land available for forestry  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:18):**  and smaller populations, therefore in need of food production on their doorstep?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:23):**  I hear that quite a lot. My standard rebuttal is to ask that question of people who have  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:28):**  horses or play golf or drink whiskey. I think I read somewhere recently that a medium sized  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:32):**  dog has an environmental footprint of about between half and three quarters of a hectare,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:36):**  something like that. And there are 12 and a half million dogs in the UK. So if we're  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:41):**  worried about strategic land use, then dogs are perhaps a big issue as well. But no, I  
**[0:17:45-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:45):**  hear that quite a lot. And what we're talking about is land use change. And the UK has always  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:51):**  imported huge amounts of timber and has done for centuries. There's a misquote, kind of  
**[0:17:57-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:57):**  Samuel Johnson, when he was on his tour of Scotland said, to see a tree in Scotland is  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:02):**  like seeing a horse in Venice. I paraphrase, but it's a line like that. So it's not a new  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:07):**  thing that we've been, you know, the start of the 1900s First World War, I think we were  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:12):**  down to about 3% woodland cover.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:14):**  Jason Vale What were we at the greatest, you know, because I think, is it something like 13% that  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:21):**  we're at now? And I can't remember exactly what the report said, but did it say that  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:25):**  we're importing 80% of the timber that we use?  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:27):**  Samuel Johnson We import about 80% of forest products in general, and we're importing last  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:32):**  year, we were importing it's gone up in terms of timber, and timber imports are now at about  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:37):**  a million cubic metres of sawn timber and board. So that's, it's not paper, it's not  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:41):**  biofuel, it's not anything else, it's just sawn nearly all softwood timber, and then  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:45):**  chipboard, fibreboard, MDF, OSB. So there's about a million cubic metres a month, every  
**[0:18:50-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:50):**  month coming in. Where we're importing from is Scandinavia, Baltics and Germany. And if  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:57):**  we're looking back about, there's various predictions that global demand for forest  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:02):**  products is going to double by about 2050, which is, for I say, that's slightly less  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:06):**  respect. The rotation was a crop of sick, a spruce on better land somewhere. So,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:11):**  Paul And why would that be? Is that primarily from, because it's replacing other products  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:15):**  within construction or why?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:17):**  Samuel Timber and fibre and forest products are globally  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:20):**  traded commodities. And so yes, there's more timber going into construction. But then globally,  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:26):**  as countries develop, as economies emerge, they tend to use more timber and fibre and  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:31):**  paper products, whether that's tissue, we use huge amounts of tissue. And as countries  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:36):**  develop, they tend to use more tissue products and paper products and I have some Amazon  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:40):**  parcels delivered yesterday, and they're all packaged in forest products. In the UK, the  
**[0:19:45-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:45):**  interest in kind of more timbering into construction is growing. And a lot of industries, a lot  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:51):**  of companies are looking at basically the carbon impacts in their supply chains, what  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:55):**  people talk about scope three and scope four emissions in their supply chains, and looking  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:00):**  at embodied carbon in construction. So that's the what you build your building out of your  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:04):**  choices of material have a huge impact on the embodied carbon. And from a UK perspective,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:09):**  there's a huge drive for new house building and that focus on embodied carbon. And then  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:14):**  the skill shortage in this construction sector, all of that is driving people towards more  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:18):**  timber in construction. So we can grow that timber in the UK, or we can import it. And  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:22):**  I think it's the same way in agriculture, when we're looking at shortening of supply  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:26):**  chains and sort of they call sticky money, you add value on the farm or add value near  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:31):**  the forest, the same thing I think is happening in happening in construction and in timber  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:36):**  growing.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:37):**  Kind of curious, you know, before we went back 400 years or so, when I've been around  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:40):**  the Scottish Highlands, I think they're trying to reforest the bottom third or so of the  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:45):**  landscape there, because until relatively recently, that was forested, but then an awful  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:51):**  lot of it was was cut down for shipbuilding and for other things. Do we have a sense of  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:55):**  what proportion of the UK was properly forested at one point rather than being kind of shrub  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:02):**  and segado type landscapes?  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:04):**  No, I haven't got a proper idea is the honest answer to that. And I think you can speak  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:09):**  to a lot of different people and you get a lot of different answers of this. I think  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:13):**  we often think of forests as kind of what we call high forest of kind of German black  
**[0:21:18-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:18):**  forest of these mature big trees. And I think probably we had some of that. I think we probably  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:24):**  had a lot of open landscape and probably a lot of dynamic landscape that moved from being  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:29):**  forest to scrub to went on fire and back again and interglacial periods when we had a whole  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:35):**  range of different tree species here. My favourite kind of little thing is you have Whitby jet,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:41):**  you know, the black mineral you get off Whitby. That's that's monkey puzzle, aracaria. So  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:45):**  that's, yeah, that's my, yeah, you want native species? Well, there you go. There's evidence  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:49):**  that monkey puzzle is a native UK species. You pick your point in time. And I think the  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:54):**  challenge for us is looking forwards that we know we've got climate change coming. We've  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:58):**  know we've got 1.5, 2, 3, 4 degrees of warming. And it's how we, you know, how do we farm?  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:04):**  How do we forest? How do we live in a rapidly changing, rapidly warming climate? I remember  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:10):**  going to the, I went on an exchange trip to the US about 20 years ago. And someone asked  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:15):**  I was in Pennsylvania and they kind of said, so what are your, and they had a whole suite  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:18):**  of pest and disease problems? And I was kind of going, oh, grey squirrels, a bit of a problem,  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:23):**  you know, and Dutch elm disease. And whereas, cholera, ash dieback, oat processional moth,  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:29):**  Phytophthora remorum in larch, we've got another Phytophthora that looks like it's impacting  
**[0:22:33-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:33):**  Douglas fir. And these changes and then environmental stresses that are coming through. And if we  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:39):**  look at forestry in Central Europe, the issues around drought and the impact drought has  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:43):**  had on beach forests and spruce forests. And then that drought has then driven increased  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:48):**  levels of ips, Typhographis, which is spruce bark beetle that's come in behind the drought.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:53):**  Trees are pretty resilient, but it's often, often they get hit by two or three different  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:58):**  things. We seem to be getting longer, hotter, drier summers, and then we're getting milder  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:02):**  winters so we don't get, often insect pests aren't getting killed off over the winter.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:06):**  So they're staying at higher levels than they have been in the past.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:08):**  And are there solutions like Martin was talking about before, you know, if you build up nature  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:13):**  on your farm, then you bring in the predators that then eat some of the nuisance insects  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:19):**  that exist and would otherwise create problems for the crops. Is there a similar solution,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:23):**  do you think, for trees? Because, you know, when we think about ash dieback, I mean, it's  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:26):**  a devastating impact on the landscape, you know, quite apart from anything else. Are  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:31):**  there things that we can learn from other places around the world that mean that we  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:36):**  can bring in predators just naturally that will help to restore that natural balance?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:41):**  Or is that something that we're still just really not sure about?  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:44):**  As the Australian example of cane toads, which is always the one about moving predators around  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:48):**  to solve problems and creating bigger problems. I suppose the...  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:52):**  I wasn't, just to be clear, I wasn't talking about bringing in predators, but changing  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:57):**  the natural environment so that natural predators are more present in a particular landscape.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:03):**  No, absolutely. And I think that is increasing and we're just battening down for another  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:09):**  storm that's kind of coming back to come rolling through in Scotland. And that understanding  
**[0:24:13-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:13):**  of resilience and that, you know, climate change isn't something that's going to happen  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:17):**  in the future. It appears to be, it appears it is happening now and we're getting more  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:21):**  frequent storms. And I know a lot of foresters have spent a lot of time, decades, carefully  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:26):**  managing forests, continuous cover forest systems or plantation forestry, and it's all  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:31):**  come down in weeks. That realisation of that, this is the new normal, we're going to get  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:36):**  these storms on a more regular basis.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:38):**  Martin, I want to go back to sort of thinking about trends and how things are changing.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:43):**  And you've been farming with nature throughout your career. You instinctively knew that trees  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:47):**  were an intrinsic part of maintaining a natural balance between farming and biodiversity.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:53):**  And I'm sure that most of the farmers listening to this podcast will probably feel the same  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:57):**  way to one extent or another, but many other producers, particularly in the last three  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:01):**  or four generations, and we've touched on this already, they've stripped out woodland  
**[0:25:05-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:05):**  and hedges to make way for crops, livestock and vehicles. To what extent do you think  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:11):**  that that extractive mindset is genuinely starting to change? Are more and more farmers  
**[0:25:17-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:17):**  starting to see the value of integrating woodland within their systems?  
**[0:25:20-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:20):**  I think things are changing, which is slow, certainly on our own farm. My father and grandfather  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:26):**  were incentivised to remove much of the woodland, to put it into grass, we removed almost all  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:31):**  the hedgerows, or they did fill the dishes in. Nature was seen to be an item that needed  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:37):**  to be moved out of the way to increase production. And the drive was just production. I suddenly  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:41):**  started to realise that much of what my father and grandfather talked about were no longer  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:45):**  here, the species, just different things are happening. It's about relearning. When I was  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:50):**  taught production at a college university, it was about output, not balance. So we started  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:56):**  putting some of the hedgerows back in through grants and different pieces. Much of that  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:00):**  was to stop hare courses and fly tippers coming onto the land, because if there's a hedge  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:04):**  in the way, and I could persuade my parents, that was a good thing. And my father was paid  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:10):**  to remove it. And within a few years, we're being paid to put hedgerows back. And it's  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:14):**  just this different thinking. As a farmer, I've got a whole lot to learn around what  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:19):**  I need to do, what I need to put in the right places. What can I get rewarded for? What  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:24):**  are the future markets for the stuff I can grow? And I think many farmers are also thinking  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:28):**  like that. We've seen, same as here, a tremendous amount of hedgerows and new trees planted,  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:33):**  some always not in the right place doing the right thing, because it just chased the payments  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:37):**  to do something, not always about the thinking. And I find many farmers, I probably put them  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:42):**  in three camps, you've got that leading group that have always done things and are leading  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:47):**  away. There's a big chunk of farmers and land managers in that middle that try to do the  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:52):**  right thing, but they're just then pulled and pushed about, but they really care for  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:56):**  what they do. They just got to find the right incentives. And there are and there still  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:00):**  is a group of farmers that we see, you know, the end of harvest, cut all the hedges back,  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:06):**  push everything out the way they want to go bigger they want to and it's not just in the  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:09):**  UK, we see that globally. And how do we tackle that group? And I think by showing examples  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:14):**  of how trees and hedges fit into a landscape and help production balance the outputs, look  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:20):**  at those future markets, we know steel and concrete will be moving, they will have to  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:25):**  the construction will have to move away from those products. And timber is the obvious  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:30):**  choice to put in. So how do I plant some timber on my land to have a market in the market  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:36):**  and opportunity in the future. And it's by showing that demonstration role, as we do  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:41):**  through the Nature Friendly Farming Network of what farmers are already doing, what have  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:45):**  been doing in the past and making it not too big a step for those that haven't done anything.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:50):**  If you only show the far end, there's always that resistance. And there is lots of negative  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:55):**  resistance within the industry, the language various organisations use, they're putting  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:00):**  things in pots and it's labelling in different systems and blaming a different label and  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:05):**  it's not fitting a system that's, you know, our organisation believes in or their organisations  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:10):**  believe in. But it's we've got to change, we've got to help farmers to change and land  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:14):**  managers change and see the new opportunities and what society is asking them to deliver  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:20):**  in that mix of more mixed approach. And also where is the future financial rewards? Where  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:26):**  are my future markets? How do I not only grow for this my generation, but the future generations  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:32):**  that will come onto this landscape, because trees were planted in the past in a similar  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:36):**  mindset, you don't plant them to harvest them now, they're harvested by the next generation  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:41):**  or the generation after that. And that's how we've got to start thinking again in that  
**[0:28:44-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:44):**  future delivery.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:45):**  I'm interested in that last group that you talked about. And I'm curious whether that's  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:50):**  a generational thing, whether it's, it's largely older farmers who've been farming for 30 or  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:56):**  40 years that you'd put in that group, or whether there's a new generation of people  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:00):**  coming in that are still actually not particularly interested in what we're talking about here.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:05):**  I think it's multi generational. And I think it's the younger generation have learned from  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:10):**  the older generation, they've encompassed themselves and been in in the same rooms and  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:14):**  meetings with the same language. And that's what they've learned. They've learned off  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:18):**  their parents. And I know talk to young farmers, and I have a lot of visitors on the farm,  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:24):**  there are still many of those people that it's a production only output, and more food,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:29):**  more output nature, why do you need to worry about that I can bring in a can of product  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:33):**  or do other things. But I do see that breaking down. And I do think that smaller minority  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:39):**  group is now starting to change. But what we do know is when they do change, they will  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:44):**  leap forward because they're quite often market minded and very good business people. And  
**[0:29:49-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:49):**  if they get the bit between their teeth, they will leap forward because they want to do  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:52):**  as much they can because they see a new opportunity.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:54):**  And I'm sure the nature friendly farming network has been really important in that. And I just  
**[0:29:59-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:59):**  wonder if you could remind us how long the nature friendly farming network has been around  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:03):**  and also whether you have seen a change yourself, a growing level of traction for the kind of  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:09):**  multiple outcome land use that we're talking about.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:13):**  Massive change happening and engagement network. So, November 17, we bought the first group  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:19):**  of farmers together. I've been working on it with a few others for about six months  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:23):**  looking at this idea. Many farmers who had been surveyed in the previous years across  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:28):**  the UK felt they didn't have a voice. We launched at the Oxford Real Farming Conference  
**[0:30:33-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:33):**  in January 2018. And in that gap, we'd had a Brexit vote and land use was going to change.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:39):**  We're going to have UK policy. And actually, because we're a whole UK farming network with  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:45):**  a steering group in each country, we can reflect the differences across in the different countries.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:50):**  But we can also come from it as farmers across the UK are managing the same bit of dirt for  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:55):**  the same sort of outputs. So, we need to do this cross border thing. And actually, the  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:59):**  growth of the network has been tremendous and opportunities farmers are getting now  
**[0:31:03-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:03):**  to come into meetings to put a different perspective across and challenge some of the old mindset  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:09):**  and thinking and where the old policy was and where we can get it to. And I think that's  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:14):**  a great opportunity to have an alternative farming voice in many meetings.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:18):**  Now, for much of this conversation, we've been worrying that there isn't enough of this  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:22):**  good stuff going on. There isn't enough woodland being integrated. But I want to come at this  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:26):**  from a slightly different perspective, because farmers are increasingly being paid for public  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:30):**  goods and services and tree planting is in one form or another is fairly easy to monetise,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:35):**  either through selling carbon sequestration and storage or simply through selling land  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:41):**  for forestry or for that matter development. So, how concerned are you that Britain's ability  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:45):**  to feed itself might be undermined by a drive for too many forests?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:51):**  Not at all concerned. Actually, when we look at our landscape use and what farmers produce  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:56):**  from that land, much isn't food for people. If the concern is feeding the nation and delivering  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:02):**  healthy quality food, well, that should be a priority for our best landscape and best  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:06):**  soils. Currently, we produce, I think 60% of the grains we produce go to feed animals.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:13):**  We produce up to one and a half million tonnes a week to go into bioethanol, several hundred  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:17):**  thousand hectares of quality, grade one to land going into maize, rhino-elk digestion.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:23):**  So, if it's about food production, we can actually really shift the dial and we can  
**[0:32:27-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:27):**  put so much more nature, habitats, trees within our landscape and it doesn't have to be one  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:34):**  or the other. We can add lots more trees and add crops in between them. We could add livestock  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:38):**  in between them. So, we haven't got to be joined up and has it got to be a sheep or  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:42):**  a cow or something like that? Or can it be deer? What is the food output? Could it be  
**[0:32:47-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:47):**  fruit and nuts? So, I just find the argument around this food security and food production  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:53):**  that just completely the wrong narrative we should be talking around and we should be  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:57):**  focused around what is the need from our landscape? What are the market drivers? What do I get  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:02):**  rewarded from? But also, how do we keep a working farmed landscape? The outputs may  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:07):**  change. We may have less livestock and more trees because that's where the reward is.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:12):**  We may have more greenhouses and food production in warehouses and underground. We can change  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:17):**  that, but we need to help the farmers stay farming and even on a tentative sector. I  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:22):**  think some of the big problems we have with some of the grants for trees, if you're the  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:26):**  landlord and your tenant is coming up for a renegotiation of a tenancy, it is quite  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:33):**  lucrative for some to actually say, well, remove the tenant, we'll just plant the trees.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:38):**  And actually, we need to get the tenants to understand there is an opportunity for them  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:42):**  to have a role in those trees and earn some income managing those trees and being involved  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:47):**  in that different landscape use. It's not about one or the other. It's about a joined  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:51):**  up approach. Again, coming back to multifunction land use  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:55):**  and phrases that sort of leap out for me while you were talking there, you know, that we  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:00):**  need land appropriate food, not food that's just grown on whatever land because a farmer  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:05):**  thinks that there's a market for it there. It's what food is appropriate for that and  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:09):**  increasingly moving to food for humans rather than feed for livestock. Thanks very much  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:15):**  for that, Martin. Andy, thinking not just of Britain, but around the world, I wonder  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:19):**  if you have examples where forestry and food production have been really well integrated.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:24):**  I've got a new phrase now, which is timber appropriate land. And I think sometimes it's,  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:29):**  as Martin was saying, it's looking at, we tend to have quite a limited timber crop in  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:33):**  terms of focusing on a few species because of the land that we're growing it on. And  
**[0:34:36-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:36):**  I think if we're looking at a more holistic approach and more wider landscapes, we'll  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:40):**  be growing more timber on a wider variety of land and we've grown a wider variety of  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:45):**  crops. If you look at, I was going to say, look at other parts of Europe that have higher  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:49):**  levels of tree and woodland cover. And you often see farms having timber and forests  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:54):**  integrated into that farm landscape. So France and Germany both have about 30% tree cover,  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:01):**  woodland cover. And compared to the UK, it's about 12, as you were saying before, about  
**[0:35:05-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:05):**  12, 13%. So I think it's kind of looking at outcomes versus symptoms, if you like.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:12):**  If we did have more integrated landscape approaches to food and to forestry and to recreation  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:18):**  and access, then we would have a higher level of tree cover. So yeah, I've got friends who  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:23):**  farm, live just outside in Germany near Karlsruhe. And there's a small land holding, but they  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:29):**  have areas of intensive food production near the town. And then they have access into the  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:34):**  wider forest further out. I think it is about that blending of different land uses. And  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:38):**  I think, I was interested, USA is another interesting example where they talk about  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:42):**  family forest owners. I lived, I hope in my lifetime we can talk about family forest owners  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:48):**  in the UK. And they talk about what they call plantation forestry, often they call it tree  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:52):**  farms. I've got a tree farm. And I just think that's kind of much more honest about this  
**[0:35:56-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:56):**  is a tree farm. I am farming trees for a purpose. And I quite like that. And I think that one  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:03):**  of the challenges then is patterns of land ownership in the UK. And I think in the UK  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:07):**  at the moment, we have a fairly narrow range of people. Well, historically, we've had a  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:10):**  narrow range of people growing timber. So there's kind of the state and the Forest Commission  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:15):**  and our W Scottish forestry. And then we have some large investment funds and a number of  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:20):**  larger states and they tend to have a fairly narrow range of management objectives. I think  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:25):**  if we had more farmers, more landowners owning forests and growing timber, then we'd find  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:29):**  new ways to do that integration. So agroforestry is great, silvopastral. But as Martin said,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:34):**  the more people we have doing this, then we're saying, well, you could try this and people  
**[0:36:38-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:38):**  going on, I'm trying this, I'm trying that. And I think we'd have new ways of integration  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:42):**  and at different scales. And I think that's, it's looking at our low woodland cover is  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:47):**  a symptom of other things. It is a problem, but it's a symptom of other problems. So if  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:52):**  we want to change that, then we need to think carefully about how we change that and what  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:56):**  are the drivers to make those changes? It strikes me that there's a potential sort  
**[0:37:00-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:00):**  of infrastructure challenge there as well. And in the same way that we find, you know,  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:05):**  as, as more people, more farmers are taking on agroecology and regenerative farming practices  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:11):**  and integrating livestock within perhaps what was previously an arable rotation, there's  
**[0:37:16-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:16):**  a need for a rethink of the whole way that we approach slaughter, for example, so that  
**[0:37:21-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:21):**  there are more small slaughterhouses dotted around the country. And I wonder if there's  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:24):**  a sort of similar challenge when it comes to processing timber products that at the  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:29):**  moment, if you've got a big plantation, then you can have a processing unit next to that.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:33):**  And that's quite straightforward. Do we need to sort of review the way that a woodland  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:37):**  infrastructure works as well?  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:39):**  Yes, that's the easy, easy answer. We've got some very big, very efficient, really, really  
**[0:37:44-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:44):**  efficient sawmills and timber processes in the UK. And they're very good at turning a  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:49):**  crooked irregular cone into square products, which is what sawmilling, a simplification  
**[0:37:55-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:55):**  of sawmilling, but that's what it is. And you know, particularly in Scotland, a huge  
**[0:37:59-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:59):**  amount of investment in getting the most out of our timber crop and getting the most of  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:03):**  that timber into higher value timber products. But absolutely, we don't want to be hauling  
**[0:38:08-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:08):**  round timber huge distances. And it's a lot of the weight is wet timbers, you know, what  
**[0:38:14-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:14):**  we want is the volume of the timber, not the weight of the timber, and we're hauling a  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:17):**  lot of timber around. And I think again, that goes back to this land ownership and objectives  
**[0:38:22-0:38:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:22):**  of woodland owning, we could be processing more timber on the farm on farms in in local  
**[0:38:28-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:28):**  estates, we always used to you know, most most estates used to have their own sawmill,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:32):**  and they used to process timber on the estate for their own use. And that's slightly gone  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:36):**  out of fashion. But there's, there's lots of good examples already of people having  
**[0:38:40-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:40):**  things like woodmiser sawmills and smaller sawbenches set up to process timber locally  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:45):**  add value to it and for it to be used locally. The big processes are great. And I've got  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:49):**  lots of friends who work at the big processes. And that investment is usually needed and  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:54):**  that that drives investment elsewhere. But yeah, I think that that looking at that timber  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:58):**  infrastructure and that's more smaller sawmills, but then also how do we get more timber onto  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:04):**  onto the rails? How do we have fewer timber trucks on the road often on narrow rural roads?  
**[0:39:09-0:39:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:09):**  Can we get a shift more of that timber onto rail infrastructure and process more of it  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:14):**  locally? So again, it's this this idea of shortening supply chains and sticky money  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:18):**  again that you process, you add value to the food or you add value to the timber locally.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:23):**  So in many ways, the challenges that face forestry are actually the same challenges  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:28):**  that face agriculture. And so it really makes sense to integrate the conversations that  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:32):**  we're having around these and I love I love those phrases that you used earlier about  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:36):**  timber appropriate land and family forest owners. Those are those are fabulous. And  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:41):**  they ring very true with with thinking about farming. And we've previously discussed and  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:46):**  I think you know, we're coming naturally to this question, aren't we about the need for  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:50):**  a proper land use strategy in Britain. First of all, do you think that's important? I think  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:55):**  you do from conversations we've had. But who would you see as being the major stakeholders  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:00):**  in a strategic process? And what would you hope that a land use strategy would actually  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:05):**  change on the ground?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:06):**  Ian I talk a lot about land use strategy. And  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:08):**  then I have a slightly nightmarish vision of a lot of meetings and workshops and then  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:12):**  a thick strategic document being produced, having everyone spent a lot of energy and  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:16):**  it just sits on a shelf and then has has kind of limited impact. So maybe again, it's kind  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:21):**  of symptoms and since what's the problem? What's the symptom of the problem? And maybe  
**[0:40:25-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:25):**  the challenge isn't just a strategy, but kind of strategic, strategic thinking, I would  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:29):**  like to see if we're talking about a land use strategy, then some of those major stakeholders  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:33):**  might be the construction sector, it might be people who are researchers working on bio  
**[0:40:39-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:39):**  plastics and bio economy, it's certainly got to include local communities and people who  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:43):**  are living and work working in these wider landscapes. So I think the idea of a land  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:47):**  use strategy, it's kind of why do we need a land use strategy? How do we make the best  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:52):**  decisions about land use? How do we make best decisions about land use change about the  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:57):**  there's a fundamental change going on in in UK agriculture at the moment with the change  
**[0:41:02-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:02):**  away from the basic payment systems in its various forms in the various in the various  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:06):**  parts of the UK, but also that when we're thinking about having a post Brexit and about  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:11):**  how where do we get our food from? How do we as Martin was saying, what crops do we  
**[0:41:14-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:14):**  want to use for what purposes? And then, you know, if we're going to be growing a lot of  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:18):**  timber, a lot more trees, where do we do that? How do we do that? Who should do that? I think  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:23):**  without some form of strategy or some basic form of decision making framework, or at least  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:28):**  a vision? I thought, yeah, and I was talking about a vision later on, but yeah, no, just  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:33):**  a vision of your what we want our rural areas to look like, do we want them to be World  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:37):**  Heritage Sites and pick a point in time of some kind of perfect vision of kind of Edwardian  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:42):**  countryside or do you want something different? And I think that's, that's the challenge.  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:46):**  And I think so I'm always nervous about kind of expanding protected areas sometimes because  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:50):**  the protection areas often is looking at kind of a vision of the landscape and we kind of  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:54):**  say, that's what we want that landscape that point in time, and landscapes aren't like  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:59):**  that landscapes are dynamic and landscapes driven by people and natural events. So yeah,  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:03):**  so a strategy, but as I say, strategic thinking. And then I think, again, if you look within,  
**[0:42:08-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:08):**  I'll pick on Defra, if you look at, you know, the people at a senior level in Defra, you  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:13):**  know, have we got the right people at that senior level? Should we have more construction  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:16):**  people sitting on the board of Defra? There's lots of eminent science scientists on the  
**[0:42:20-0:42:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:20):**  US Advisory Council, but there's no forest scientists, no construction scientists. Again,  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:26):**  it's the strategy versus strategic thinking. And I think I think a vision is the key thing.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:31):**  Here, what's what's our vision for our rural areas? Do we want them to be full of Airbnbs  
**[0:42:35-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:35):**  and second homes? Do we want dynamic thriving communities, the whole housing challenge in  
**[0:42:40-0:42:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:40):**  rural areas is a huge problem. All these things are interconnected. And I think it's that  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:45):**  challenge of seeing, having this forest is a problem here. And Airbnbs are a problem  
**[0:42:51-0:42:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:51):**  there. Access to health services is a problem there. And all these things are interconnected.  
**[0:42:56-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:56):**  And I think there's just a real and it is a huge challenge for governments and government  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:00):**  departments not to have a to have that vision to have that strategic thinking. I want a  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:05):**  land use strategy, but I don't want a thick document that sits on a shelf and doesn't  
**[0:43:10-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:10):**  do anything.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:11):**  Martin, what do you think about, you know, a land use vision or strategy? Do you think  
**[0:43:16-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:16):**  that's something that's needed or is the natural push and pull between private sector requirements  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:21):**  and government policy already delivering, you know, reasonable land use outcomes already?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:26):**  I think we need something if we leave it to the marketplace and the leaders, the government  
**[0:43:30-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:30):**  will pull in policy and bits. We may not get the best outcomes in the right places and  
**[0:43:34-0:43:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:34):**  some market might lead in the wrong direction when we look back in what we do. I've always  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:40):**  thought we needed a strategy, but I'm more coming to the conclusion the governments,  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:45):**  national government don't want to do a top down, but we do need a land use framework.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:49):**  We know climate is going to change some of our most productive soils and the fennel may  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:53):**  be underwater in 50 years time. Some other areas may see increased droughts. We need  
**[0:43:59-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:59):**  to understand the bigger plan of what's going to happen to our countryside and our landscape  
**[0:44:03-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:03):**  with the climate change is coming. So we need that framework of what are the challenges  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:07):**  as from a national framework and from national governments, what are the opportunities, the  
**[0:44:13-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:13):**  challenges, where do we need to put infrastructure, where do we need to put food production, timber  
**[0:44:17-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:17):**  and other things. And then I think it really needs to go down to a local framework and  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:21):**  strategy because it's local people and local communities and councils and land managers  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:27):**  that can actually tailor the outputs of what's needed. We know where the right trees may  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:32):**  go with some advice. We know which bits of land are most productive or may flood or we  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:37):**  may need to put some housing there or infrastructure. But I do think we need that framework from  
**[0:44:42-0:44:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:42):**  the national governments and from defers and structurally joined up right across the UK.  
**[0:44:48-0:44:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:48):**  Even though we've got devolved governments, we need that joined up because just because  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:52):**  there's a line in the map, it doesn't mean it stops one side or the other. And then we  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:55):**  need the local and regional bits to take ownership of some of this and set out some clear strategy  
**[0:45:01-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:01):**  of what do we need, what is the best use, because then that follows on where do we put  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:05):**  the timber manufacturing plants, where do we put the new abattoirs and the other infrastructure  
**[0:45:10-0:45:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:10):**  things we will need from that strategy.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:12):**  Jason Vale, Director of  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:13):**  And Martin, you talk to government quite a bit. Do you get a sense that there is an appetite  
**[0:45:18-0:45:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:18):**  for this? Is it already happening in any form?  
**[0:45:20-0:45:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:20):**  Martin  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:20):**  There's no appetite whatsoever. They are not keen at all in doing a land use strategy  
**[0:45:25-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:25):**  and top down approach. In England, it will go down to the local councils to do local  
**[0:45:32-0:45:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:32):**  nature recovery plans and local structures. It really concerns me we don't have a vision  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:37):**  across the top and a framework of actually the bigger challenges we have for a smallish  
**[0:45:41-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:41):**  island with lots of people and lots of demand on the landscape. Okay, so what are the priorities?  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:46):**  What is the vision of, we know government wants 30,000 hectares per year of trees planted.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:52):**  So okay, we could deliver that. Where do we put them? We don't want just one or two blocks,  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:58):**  they need to be across the landscape, but then we need to put the infrastructure in,  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:01):**  we need the timber processing places and the other opportunities and structure putting  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:04):**  in. Currently, we don't see that and I don't hear that coming from the government. And  
**[0:46:08-0:46:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:08):**  that for me, that's really concerning as a land manager, will I be doing the right things  
**[0:46:12-0:46:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:12):**  in the future that society wants? Or will I just take a marketplace approach and someone  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:17):**  who offers me the most money and do something when particularly in trees and other things,  
**[0:46:22-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:22):**  that's a 30, 40, 50 year window. If I grow a crop as an arable farmer, next year, I can  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:27):**  do a different crop. I have only changed land use for a 12 month period, but some of this  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:32):**  bigger infrastructure stuff that's going to need to happen and will happen because of  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:36):**  climate change, we need that structure and plan in place. And I certainly push it as  
**[0:46:41-0:46:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:41):**  often as I can. I was talking to parts of Dethwa this morning and I was certainly pushing  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:46):**  that point that actually we need that vision and the plan to know how we stitch it all  
**[0:46:50-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:50):**  together in the future. Fantastic. That's really interesting. Now,  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:53):**  Andy, just finally, I want to sort of take a long view. We've been talking throughout  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:57):**  this about the importance of woodlands and forests. Clearly they play a critical role  
**[0:47:02-0:47:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:02):**  for business, for mitigating and adapting to climate change and for nature restoration.  
**[0:47:07-0:47:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:07):**  And gradually trees are being reintegrated into farm systems. So thinking forward 20  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:12):**  years, if you were travelling around Britain a generation from now, how different do you  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:16):**  think that countryside, that landscape would look? The easy answer to that is I'd like  
**[0:47:21-0:47:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:21):**  to see more trees and woodlands and more woodlands in better management, whether that's for biodiversity  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:25):**  or for recreation or for timber or ideally a combination of all three. A few years ago,  
**[0:47:30-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:30):**  I was involved in a researcher called Vanessa Burton, who did some work on attitudes around  
**[0:47:36-0:47:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:36):**  forest expansion in Scotland. And she produced some really great kind of stylised landscape  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:40):**  images of a landscape would look like within more trees and managed for different purposes.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:44):**  And if you Google Vanessa Burton and Green Gold, you should find her blog and these images.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:49):**  But I think that's going back to what Martin was saying before, is always that challenge  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:52):**  of sort of, yeah, no, we want more trees or we want more timber or we want more woodland,  
**[0:47:57-0:48:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:57):**  but kind of not here, kind of somewhere else. I think we do need that vision in that landscape.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:01):**  So yeah, more trees and more woodlands managed, you know, not just plunk, not just done for  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:06):**  the ground, done for a purpose. And that purpose might be biodiversity, it might be growing  
**[0:48:10-0:48:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:10):**  timber, it might be to have more access on the edge of towns where there's a huge demand  
**[0:48:15-0:48:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:15):**  for countryside access, let's plant some more trees there and let's have multi-purpose woodlands  
**[0:48:21-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:21):**  on the edge of towns and more that connection between communities and people and woodlands.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:26):**  So whether that's more woodland owned and managed by local councils or more woodlands  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:32):**  and trees on farms and managed and owned by local communities, that shorter supply chain,  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:37):**  what we're talking about that kind of infrastructure of sawmilling and construction. I think it'd  
**[0:48:42-0:48:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:42):**  be great to see more timber construction in rural areas intact. I mean, there's a lot  
**[0:48:47-0:48:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:47):**  of CLT being built in central London, there's almost more CLT in central London than there  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:52):**  is in the rural areas. You know, when we could be building this huge demand for rural housing,  
**[0:48:58-0:49:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:58):**  we could be building that out of locally sourced, locally grown material and keeping that money,  
**[0:49:04-0:49:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:04):**  keeping that investment in local communities. And I think if we had more timber construction,  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:09):**  and then that would be a radical game changer in people's attitudes towards growing timber.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:13):**  And people can see that forest there is going to build these homes here. It's not just going  
**[0:49:18-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:18):**  on a timber truck and disappearing. Some of it is staying locally, some of it will always  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:22):**  go to a big sawmill in the same way as some agriculture will be large scale. I think that  
**[0:49:26-0:49:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:26):**  would be a real game changer is people seeing that connection between woodlands on their  
**[0:49:30-0:49:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:30):**  doorstep and the products and materials that they use.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:34):**  That's fantastic. Thanks so much, bro. That's all we've got time for. I'd like to thank

### Farm Gate  (2022-03-24)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to FarmGate. I'm Finn LoKusteyn, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  of the Food and Global Security Network. In this programme, we're talking trees. Demand  for new woodland is growing for everything from timber to carbon sequestration. But forests  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:20):**  take up space and competition for land is increasing. How do we balance the demands  of food production, nature, housing and infrastructure with the need for new woodland and forest  products? And is it time at last for a joined-up land use strategy for the UK and for other  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:36):**  places around the world? I'm joined by Andrew Heald, a consultant specialising in sustainable  forests and plantations, and by Martin Lines, the Chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network.  Welcome both. Hello. Hi, good morning Finno. Good morning, Martin. Andy, let's start with  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:00:52):**  a simple question. What do we need wood and woodland for? Well, I think we need trees,  more trees and more woodland in our landscapes for lots of different reasons, whether that's  for biodiversity or habitat connection, for carbon sequestration, to provide shelter for  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:06):**  livestock on farms or protect rivers from runoff or to shade those rivers. There's  an interesting initiative in Scotland called Riverwoods looking at shading of rivers and  how important that is for salmonid stocks. More woodlands and more trees can have an  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:19):**  impact around soil erosion and they're nice places to walk, to run or just to sit and  contemplate life in. And of course, I'm really interested in those woodlands and forests  from a timber and a fibre perspective and how we use that timber and fibre to decarbonise  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:34):**  a lot of what we do in our economies. It's interesting, isn't it? Because, you know,  the countryside, whether it's farmland or whether it's woodland, there is this competition,  you know, for different sort of functions, whether it, you know, there's the economic  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:46):**  functions but also the wellbeing functions. And at this point in time, particularly after  COVID over the last couple of years, that wellbeing, that sort of amenity element is  critically important.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:01:56):**  Yeah, no, I think so. And I think anyone managing the countryside where there's easy access  has seen a huge boom in the number of people turning up and how we manage that impact.  And different forest management types or different farmers are able to cope with that differently.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:10):**  Obviously, there's been a huge increase in negative impacts of people accessing the countryside,  but there is that demand. And I think a lot of people have rediscovered the kind of countryside  on their doorstep. And I don't think that demand is going to go away. And I think we  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:22):**  need to think carefully about how we manage that land and how we work with landowners  and land managers to kind of increase the positive aspects of that and reduce the negative  aspects. I think woodland does soak up a lot of access pressure managed in the right way.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:35):**  And I think we're going to come on to quite a few of those issues because there was lots  in what you just said there, and we'll start to unpack that as we go forward. But before  we do, I just want to ask you about different forestry mixes because, of course, different  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:46):**  forestry mixes serve different outcomes. And I wonder if you could talk us through some  of the different types of woodland that we might encounter and what the trees that grow  in them might be used for.  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:02:57):**  I think we'll need a longer podcast for that. I think we also spend a lot of time kind of  labelling woodland types and woodland management practices. And sometimes those labels aren't  helpful, but I tend to think of different outcomes of woodland management and kind of  
**[0:03:12-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:12):**  work backwards from there. So if you're interested in woodlands for biodiversity and particularly  managing biodiversity that likes open space and edges within woodland, then you could  have a coppice woodland, a coppice broadleaf woodland. If perhaps your objective is growing  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:27):**  saw logs for UK construction, then you can perhaps be growing more conifers rather than  broadleaves and thinning them over a longer rotation so that well-thinned managed conifer  woodland. And I think sometimes we tend to reduce things often to oversimplify kind of  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:41):**  woodland management. So we can and do and should be managing broadleaf native woodland  for timber and we should be managing and we can and should also be managing pine plantations  for biodiversity. And then there's this huge everything in between. The other complication  
**[0:03:56-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:03:56):**  or other added level of interest is that sometimes what you're managing woodland for, part of  a woodland for and the outcomes will change over time. So say in a conifer forest, you  might have a restock site within that conifer forest that might be really good for night  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:12):**  jar and black grouse because the area is clear, it's got shelter and that's good for that  habitat. But then the crops close and it becomes less good for those species. And that's just  like in a, and that cycle starts in another part of the forest. That's just like a broadleaf  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:25):**  coppice woodland where a broadleaf coppice woodland is good, really good for woodland  flora and biodiversity and butterflies in that when you have that, it's just been felled  and it's open. And then that woodland changes over time. I think similarly a lot of the  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:37):**  1960s and 70s plantation forestry we had were planted with a particular outcome or aspect  of pulp and paper and obviously the sort of famously growing pit props for the coal industry.  They weren't thought about as, we weren't thinking about mass timber or bioplastics  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:04:53):**  or the wider bioeconomy. So I think that's that challenge of everything from native wild  woodland to intensively managed plantations. But those intensively managed plantations  could be a wide range of species. So that's what makes woodland and forestry just like  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:05):**  farming and agriculture. It covers such a wide range of habitat types and outcomes.  And just to clear something up before we get any further, because you've told me off in  the past when I've misrepresented Sitka spruce, for example, and you said, don't talk about  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:20):**  Sitka spruce when you're talking about carbon sequestration, because that's not what it's  called. Carbon sequestration, you know, it's through broadleaf woodland instead. Is that  right? Let's just be clear before we get any further.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:31):**  Sitka spruce sequesters carbon. That's the sequestering carbon is what turns CO2 in the  atmosphere into wood, into timber, into stuff. And generally if people are planting conifers,  then they're planting a crop and it's that crop to be harvested. So that crop is sequestered  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:05:48):**  carbon. It's stored carbon. But you're planting it for a different, for a range of different  purposes. So if people are planting spruce, it's because they want to grow a crop of spruce,  which might be used for a range of products from timber and construction to wooden pallets,  
**[0:06:01-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:01):**  to fencing, to some paper products and everything in between.  So of course, whichever trees you're planting, they are sequestering carbon from the atmosphere,  as you said then. But if we're looking at planting trees and growing woodland to locking  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:13):**  carbon in perpetuity, then that is a woodland that's unlikely to be cropped. And actually  it's a woodland that we would expect to be staying there.  Again, it depends on your objectives as if you just want to lock up carbon in situ, then  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:27):**  yes, it would probably be an unmanaged or lightly managed broadleaf woodland that's  going to sit there for a long time. Or you could be growing large sequoias and leaving  them there for 1000 years. But arguably what we need to be doing is reducing emissions.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:40):**  That's the big thing we need to do is reduce emissions. And a lot of emissions in the UK  come from the construction sector. And if we were growing more timber and getting more  timber into construction, then we're sequestering carbon in that timber. And then we get the  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:06:52):**  kind of double benefit of if we're using less concrete and steel and more timber in construction,  then there's less emissions from that concrete and steel. So just looking at in situ carbon  stored in the woodland is great. That's kind of only one aspect.  
**[0:07:05-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:05):**  That's been a fantastic sort of introduction to the world of forestry and timber. Martin,  let's just come over to you. What role does woodland play for you on your farm?  So currently not a massive amount. I'm in Caminshire, we haven't got a huge amount of  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:19):**  woodlands on our farm. We have got a bit of what's left of a medieval woodland. And there's  a little bit of coppice in area in there. So we have coppice, a little bit of hazel.  And in the past, some of that woodland was removed to gain an area based payment or to  
**[0:07:34-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:34):**  a grassland payment to meet the EU payment structure in cap. We have other trees dotted  along the landscape that provide us firewood and fuel for the winter. But that is changing  and where and how we put trees will change as well.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:07:50):**  Do you have a plan in place? Are you already starting to plant new trees and take up new  space and think about ways that they integrate within your system?  Very much so. I count a farm as an asset manager. I manage the landscape and I'm trying to get  
**[0:08:03-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:03):**  the best I can from it. We have some fairly productive soils and we can get some good  yields of traditional crops so that I can get a good return there. But I've also got  parts of the farm that lay wetter or not the best soils. So we're already now identifying  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:16):**  a number of areas to restock woodlands, plant new woodland, make some shelter bales as our  wind changes and I've got a lot of development that's going to come around us. How can I  use trees as an actual defence? But it's not just trees, it's hedges and other bits as  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:30):**  well and we can actually just think about as our climate changes, we're seeing more  wind. So can I put hedges and trees in places to slow the flow of air down, which warms  my ground up and makes my crops grow better. I just think it's an integrated process of  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:43):**  how we fit trees into our landscape will be so important in the future and we must be  more open minded in the way we're thinking about it. We've been so siloed in our previous  thinking of what is farming, what is food, what is timber, what is the other goods we  
**[0:08:56-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:08:56):**  produce.  It's interesting because you've already started talking there about the way in which it's  not just land that you've kind of set aside for conservation and nature and then other  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:06):**  land that you're using for farming, but there is this integration and I wonder, you know,  just from a, I mean, you mentioned there about air flows and temperatures and windbreaks,  but are there other ways that you're able to integrate new trees and hedges with food  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:20):**  production that will help to improve your productivity and profitability?  Huge opportunities and the more open minded we are, we can put them in the middle of fields.  We can make avenues in Agra forestry and Tulkata, with GPS, they won't be in the way of my modern  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:34):**  machinery and large scale machinery. Then we can add fruit and nuts in, have I got a  local market? What's timber resource I may need in the future? On our own farm, what  can I sell? If we put the right species in hedgerows and the flowering species, there's  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:09:47):**  increased pollinator and predatory insect benefit. I'm seeing on our own farm, we haven't  needed to use insecticides for nine years, because we deliver habitat and that part of  that is within my hedgerow. So I have a resource of predators and beneficials that can come  
**[0:10:01-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:01):**  and help my crop. But we just need to understand and I need to learn the benefits of all the  different species, habitat and things I can put on the farm and how I can make them all  coexist. And what I'm finding it reduces my overheads, it reduces my costs, and gives  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:17):**  me a more stable output that is particularly as our climate changes that makes my business  more resilient. And by taking those less productive areas out from growing crops, generating income  through habitat, through timber in the future, through other things, that makes my business  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:31):**  more robust and benefiting in the future.  So if I play that back a little bit, then there's a degree to which you found over the  last decades that you've been farming, if farmers simply strip away nature in order  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:43):**  to grow a crop, then they've stripped out everything that's going to help them. And  so you end up having to sort of spend money bringing stuff in using chemicals, using insecticides,  because you've taken away the nature that would work for you if it was still there.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:10:58):**  So by bringing back in trees, by bringing hedgerows back in, by working with nature  and rebalancing that, you're bringing in those natural predators, that natural balance, that  means that it ultimately it saves you quite a lot of money.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:11):**  Yeah. And part of what we're doing as a network, nature means business. Nature gives us free  asset and free availability of sunshine, water and soil. And if we can work with it, we are  not bringing in that artificial resource to compensate for nature. And much of that resource  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:26):**  is a fossil fuel based in fertilizers and sprays in energy and fuel. So why would I  want to be buying something when I can, if I balance it well and get the right output,  it's free, and then I'll get more output. And it is really a different way of thinking.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:40):**  And in the past has always been about focusing on increasing production of single crops,  on a culture that, and the future is this combined landscape use, understanding what  we get and how they all coexist to get better outputs through effort of all the things I  
**[0:11:57-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:11:57):**  can produce.  So Andy, I mean, that must sound like music to your ears in many ways, but you know, in  the last hundred years or so, New Woodland has largely been separated from agriculture.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:08):**  There's been a strategic, that sounds a little grand, a strategic plan, but it sort of ended  up being that trees have been grown specifically for timber products have been produced in  monocultures of one kind and some of them pretty horrendous. And there has been that  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:23):**  sort of sparing approach. And a new report from the Soil Association is calling for what  they call regenerative forestry, a move away from this more traditional sparing way of  doing things where farming, forestry and conservation are done in different places and towards a  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:40):**  sharing approach, which is the kind of thing that both you and Martin have been talking  about with woodlands providing multiple outcomes. So what does regenerative forestry mean to  you and how can we achieve it going forward?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:12:53):**  Yeah, no, I think it's really interesting and it's exciting to hear what Martin was  saying there. And I think it's easy to look back on kind of forestry and agricultural  practices of 40, 50, 60 years ago and think, why did we do that? And what were the questions,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:08):**  some of the government policies that were driving the kind of post-war intensification  of land use, whether that's Finland, arable agriculture or the planting of the flow countries,  I think it all came from the same place. It was really interesting to read that Soil Association  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:21):**  report and that talk about regenerative forestry and to hear Martin talking about regenerative  farming. And I think it is about taking this, as Martin was saying, it's about taking  a whole systems approach and it's understanding about what aspects of forest management have  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:35):**  the biggest positive impacts and what have the negative impacts, understanding the trade-offs  between the two and sort of working to that. And I think that the report, the one of the  things I really like about the report is the Soil Association have a long history of auditing  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:13:50):**  forest management in the UK, which perhaps not many people know about. We have a forest  management standard in the UK called AQUAS, UK Woodland Assurance Standard and Soil Association  are one of the main certifying bodies for that standard. So that report is based on  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:04):**  probably about 20 years of auditing experience and talking to a lot of forest managers across  the UK. And the AQUAS standard has been around for about 20 years. It's revised every five  years by a multi-stakeholder group, which includes representatives from RSVP, Woodland  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:19):**  Trust, forestry companies and community woodland groups. So that report on regenerative forestry  is really pulling together a lot of existing really good practice. And I think giving kind  of policy makers a shove in the right direction. And I think we're all facing in the right  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:32):**  direction, but a shove to move faster and quicker. And I think there is that line about  the future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed. There is some really good stuff.  There's lots of really good forest management practice and farm management practices going  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:45):**  on. And I think sometimes you just need, everyone needs to be shown. And I don't mean that in  a patronising way, but just go, well, you could do it like this. And this is the benefits  and these are the trade-offs. And I think that report is really good for just opening  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:14:59):**  everyone's eyes a little bit saying, look, this is what's already occurring. And this  is what we need to be doing a lot more of. And as Martin said, instead of trying to,  if you've got areas that aren't growing good crops, then pumping a lot of energy, energy  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:12):**  and input into that land probably isn't a hugely good decision from an environmental  point of view or from an economic point of view.  Jason Vale,  
**[0:15:07-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:07):**  You know, within that, you're talking about both nudging and frameworks and some of those  nudges and frameworks come from sort of peer to peer information sharing, which I guess  are within that scheme that you were talking about. So there's a huge amount of experience  
**[0:15:39-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:39):**  and knowledge there. Martin, you were wanting to come in.  Martin Poulton,  Yeah, I just want to pick up the point. You referenced seeing trees and some of the plants  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:15:46):**  as monoculture and not being great. We could also look at farming in the same. We see huge  areas of single crops growing on mass areas and mass areas of single species, grasses  and rice, only delivering for output. So I do think we need to rethink our thinking and  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:02):**  what is monoculture? Is it just trees or is it a whole farming system in the way we've  farmed before? And how do we look to go forward in a more systems regenerative way and don't  blame the past but also learn from it and in a more joined up approach as we move forward  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:19):**  and have a rethink on our landscape use and the outputs and how we have a more mixed output  in the future.  Jason Vale,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:26):**  I'm glad you came in and said that because I was thinking when Andy said, you know, we're  sort of looking back sort of 50, 60 years to some of the bad practice in the past, I  was kind of thinking you're being very generous there, Andy, certainly in terms of agriculture,  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:37):**  because as you say, Martin, there is still a lot of monoculture cropping when it comes  to agriculture particularly. And you know, what's exciting on this podcast is we talk  to so many people who are sort of doing different, who are starting and finding success within  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:16:52):**  that whole systems approach. Andy, let me come back and say something rude to you and  offer you a chance to kind of address a couple of these things. Now, something that I've  heard people say is that the UK is comparatively small, and we don't necessarily have space  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:07):**  for a lot more forestry. So the first question is, is that true? What's the rebuttal? And  is there a problem with importing timber from places with more land available for forestry  and smaller populations, therefore in need of food production on their doorstep?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:23):**  I hear that quite a lot. My standard rebuttal is to ask that question of people who have  horses or play golf or drink whiskey. I think I read somewhere recently that a medium sized  dog has an environmental footprint of about between half and three quarters of a hectare,  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:36):**  something like that. And there are 12 and a half million dogs in the UK. So if we're  worried about strategic land use, then dogs are perhaps a big issue as well. But no, I  hear that quite a lot. And what we're talking about is land use change. And the UK has always  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:17:51):**  imported huge amounts of timber and has done for centuries. There's a misquote, kind of  Samuel Johnson, when he was on his tour of Scotland said, to see a tree in Scotland is  like seeing a horse in Venice. I paraphrase, but it's a line like that. So it's not a new  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:07):**  thing that we've been, you know, the start of the 1900s First World War, I think we were  down to about 3% woodland cover.  Jason Vale What were we at the greatest, you know, because I think, is it something like 13% that  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:21):**  we're at now? And I can't remember exactly what the report said, but did it say that  we're importing 80% of the timber that we use?  Samuel Johnson We import about 80% of forest products in general, and we're importing last  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:32):**  year, we were importing it's gone up in terms of timber, and timber imports are now at about  a million cubic metres of sawn timber and board. So that's, it's not paper, it's not  biofuel, it's not anything else, it's just sawn nearly all softwood timber, and then  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:18:45):**  chipboard, fibreboard, MDF, OSB. So there's about a million cubic metres a month, every  month coming in. Where we're importing from is Scandinavia, Baltics and Germany. And if  we're looking back about, there's various predictions that global demand for forest  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:02):**  products is going to double by about 2050, which is, for I say, that's slightly less  respect. The rotation was a crop of sick, a spruce on better land somewhere. So,  Paul And why would that be? Is that primarily from, because it's replacing other products  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:15):**  within construction or why?  Samuel Timber and fibre and forest products are globally  traded commodities. And so yes, there's more timber going into construction. But then globally,  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:26):**  as countries develop, as economies emerge, they tend to use more timber and fibre and  paper products, whether that's tissue, we use huge amounts of tissue. And as countries  develop, they tend to use more tissue products and paper products and I have some Amazon  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:40):**  parcels delivered yesterday, and they're all packaged in forest products. In the UK, the  interest in kind of more timbering into construction is growing. And a lot of industries, a lot  of companies are looking at basically the carbon impacts in their supply chains, what  
**[0:19:55-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:19:55):**  people talk about scope three and scope four emissions in their supply chains, and looking  at embodied carbon in construction. So that's the what you build your building out of your  choices of material have a huge impact on the embodied carbon. And from a UK perspective,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:09):**  there's a huge drive for new house building and that focus on embodied carbon. And then  the skill shortage in this construction sector, all of that is driving people towards more  timber in construction. So we can grow that timber in the UK, or we can import it. And  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:22):**  I think it's the same way in agriculture, when we're looking at shortening of supply  chains and sort of they call sticky money, you add value on the farm or add value near  the forest, the same thing I think is happening in happening in construction and in timber  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:36):**  growing.  Kind of curious, you know, before we went back 400 years or so, when I've been around  the Scottish Highlands, I think they're trying to reforest the bottom third or so of the  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:20:45):**  landscape there, because until relatively recently, that was forested, but then an awful  lot of it was was cut down for shipbuilding and for other things. Do we have a sense of  what proportion of the UK was properly forested at one point rather than being kind of shrub  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:02):**  and segado type landscapes?  No, I haven't got a proper idea is the honest answer to that. And I think you can speak  to a lot of different people and you get a lot of different answers of this. I think  
**[0:21:13-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:13):**  we often think of forests as kind of what we call high forest of kind of German black  forest of these mature big trees. And I think probably we had some of that. I think we probably  had a lot of open landscape and probably a lot of dynamic landscape that moved from being  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:29):**  forest to scrub to went on fire and back again and interglacial periods when we had a whole  range of different tree species here. My favourite kind of little thing is you have Whitby jet,  you know, the black mineral you get off Whitby. That's that's monkey puzzle, aracaria. So  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:45):**  that's, yeah, that's my, yeah, you want native species? Well, there you go. There's evidence  that monkey puzzle is a native UK species. You pick your point in time. And I think the  challenge for us is looking forwards that we know we've got climate change coming. We've  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:21:58):**  know we've got 1.5, 2, 3, 4 degrees of warming. And it's how we, you know, how do we farm?  How do we forest? How do we live in a rapidly changing, rapidly warming climate? I remember  going to the, I went on an exchange trip to the US about 20 years ago. And someone asked  
**[0:22:15-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:15):**  I was in Pennsylvania and they kind of said, so what are your, and they had a whole suite  of pest and disease problems? And I was kind of going, oh, grey squirrels, a bit of a problem,  you know, and Dutch elm disease. And whereas, cholera, ash dieback, oat processional moth,  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:29):**  Phytophthora remorum in larch, we've got another Phytophthora that looks like it's impacting  Douglas fir. And these changes and then environmental stresses that are coming through. And if we  look at forestry in Central Europe, the issues around drought and the impact drought has  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:43):**  had on beach forests and spruce forests. And then that drought has then driven increased  levels of ips, Typhographis, which is spruce bark beetle that's come in behind the drought.  Trees are pretty resilient, but it's often, often they get hit by two or three different  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:22:58):**  things. We seem to be getting longer, hotter, drier summers, and then we're getting milder  winters so we don't get, often insect pests aren't getting killed off over the winter.  So they're staying at higher levels than they have been in the past.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:08):**  And are there solutions like Martin was talking about before, you know, if you build up nature  on your farm, then you bring in the predators that then eat some of the nuisance insects  that exist and would otherwise create problems for the crops. Is there a similar solution,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:23):**  do you think, for trees? Because, you know, when we think about ash dieback, I mean, it's  a devastating impact on the landscape, you know, quite apart from anything else. Are  there things that we can learn from other places around the world that mean that we  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:36):**  can bring in predators just naturally that will help to restore that natural balance?  Or is that something that we're still just really not sure about?  As the Australian example of cane toads, which is always the one about moving predators around  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:23:48):**  to solve problems and creating bigger problems. I suppose the...  I wasn't, just to be clear, I wasn't talking about bringing in predators, but changing  the natural environment so that natural predators are more present in a particular landscape.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:03):**  No, absolutely. And I think that is increasing and we're just battening down for another  storm that's kind of coming back to come rolling through in Scotland. And that understanding  of resilience and that, you know, climate change isn't something that's going to happen  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:17):**  in the future. It appears to be, it appears it is happening now and we're getting more  frequent storms. And I know a lot of foresters have spent a lot of time, decades, carefully  managing forests, continuous cover forest systems or plantation forestry, and it's all  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:31):**  come down in weeks. That realisation of that, this is the new normal, we're going to get  these storms on a more regular basis.  Martin, I want to go back to sort of thinking about trends and how things are changing.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:43):**  And you've been farming with nature throughout your career. You instinctively knew that trees  were an intrinsic part of maintaining a natural balance between farming and biodiversity.  And I'm sure that most of the farmers listening to this podcast will probably feel the same  
**[0:24:57-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:24:57):**  way to one extent or another, but many other producers, particularly in the last three  or four generations, and we've touched on this already, they've stripped out woodland  and hedges to make way for crops, livestock and vehicles. To what extent do you think  
**[0:25:11-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:11):**  that that extractive mindset is genuinely starting to change? Are more and more farmers  starting to see the value of integrating woodland within their systems?  I think things are changing, which is slow, certainly on our own farm. My father and grandfather  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:26):**  were incentivised to remove much of the woodland, to put it into grass, we removed almost all  the hedgerows, or they did fill the dishes in. Nature was seen to be an item that needed  to be moved out of the way to increase production. And the drive was just production. I suddenly  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:41):**  started to realise that much of what my father and grandfather talked about were no longer  here, the species, just different things are happening. It's about relearning. When I was  taught production at a college university, it was about output, not balance. So we started  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:25:56):**  putting some of the hedgerows back in through grants and different pieces. Much of that  was to stop hare courses and fly tippers coming onto the land, because if there's a hedge  in the way, and I could persuade my parents, that was a good thing. And my father was paid  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:10):**  to remove it. And within a few years, we're being paid to put hedgerows back. And it's  just this different thinking. As a farmer, I've got a whole lot to learn around what  I need to do, what I need to put in the right places. What can I get rewarded for? What  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:24):**  are the future markets for the stuff I can grow? And I think many farmers are also thinking  like that. We've seen, same as here, a tremendous amount of hedgerows and new trees planted,  some always not in the right place doing the right thing, because it just chased the payments  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:37):**  to do something, not always about the thinking. And I find many farmers, I probably put them  in three camps, you've got that leading group that have always done things and are leading  away. There's a big chunk of farmers and land managers in that middle that try to do the  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:26:52):**  right thing, but they're just then pulled and pushed about, but they really care for  what they do. They just got to find the right incentives. And there are and there still  is a group of farmers that we see, you know, the end of harvest, cut all the hedges back,  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:06):**  push everything out the way they want to go bigger they want to and it's not just in the  UK, we see that globally. And how do we tackle that group? And I think by showing examples  of how trees and hedges fit into a landscape and help production balance the outputs, look  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:20):**  at those future markets, we know steel and concrete will be moving, they will have to  the construction will have to move away from those products. And timber is the obvious  choice to put in. So how do I plant some timber on my land to have a market in the market  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:36):**  and opportunity in the future. And it's by showing that demonstration role, as we do  through the Nature Friendly Farming Network of what farmers are already doing, what have  been doing in the past and making it not too big a step for those that haven't done anything.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:27:50):**  If you only show the far end, there's always that resistance. And there is lots of negative  resistance within the industry, the language various organisations use, they're putting  things in pots and it's labelling in different systems and blaming a different label and  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:05):**  it's not fitting a system that's, you know, our organisation believes in or their organisations  believe in. But it's we've got to change, we've got to help farmers to change and land  managers change and see the new opportunities and what society is asking them to deliver  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:20):**  in that mix of more mixed approach. And also where is the future financial rewards? Where  are my future markets? How do I not only grow for this my generation, but the future generations  that will come onto this landscape, because trees were planted in the past in a similar  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:36):**  mindset, you don't plant them to harvest them now, they're harvested by the next generation  or the generation after that. And that's how we've got to start thinking again in that  future delivery.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:28:45):**  I'm interested in that last group that you talked about. And I'm curious whether that's  a generational thing, whether it's, it's largely older farmers who've been farming for 30 or  40 years that you'd put in that group, or whether there's a new generation of people  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:00):**  coming in that are still actually not particularly interested in what we're talking about here.  I think it's multi generational. And I think it's the younger generation have learned from  the older generation, they've encompassed themselves and been in in the same rooms and  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:14):**  meetings with the same language. And that's what they've learned. They've learned off  their parents. And I know talk to young farmers, and I have a lot of visitors on the farm,  there are still many of those people that it's a production only output, and more food,  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:29):**  more output nature, why do you need to worry about that I can bring in a can of product  or do other things. But I do see that breaking down. And I do think that smaller minority  group is now starting to change. But what we do know is when they do change, they will  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:44):**  leap forward because they're quite often market minded and very good business people. And  if they get the bit between their teeth, they will leap forward because they want to do  as much they can because they see a new opportunity.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:29:54):**  And I'm sure the nature friendly farming network has been really important in that. And I just  wonder if you could remind us how long the nature friendly farming network has been around  and also whether you have seen a change yourself, a growing level of traction for the kind of  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:09):**  multiple outcome land use that we're talking about.  Massive change happening and engagement network. So, November 17, we bought the first group  of farmers together. I've been working on it with a few others for about six months  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:23):**  looking at this idea. Many farmers who had been surveyed in the previous years across  the UK felt they didn't have a voice. We launched at the Oxford Real Farming Conference  in January 2018. And in that gap, we'd had a Brexit vote and land use was going to change.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:39):**  We're going to have UK policy. And actually, because we're a whole UK farming network with  a steering group in each country, we can reflect the differences across in the different countries.  But we can also come from it as farmers across the UK are managing the same bit of dirt for  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:30:55):**  the same sort of outputs. So, we need to do this cross border thing. And actually, the  growth of the network has been tremendous and opportunities farmers are getting now  to come into meetings to put a different perspective across and challenge some of the old mindset  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:09):**  and thinking and where the old policy was and where we can get it to. And I think that's  a great opportunity to have an alternative farming voice in many meetings.  Now, for much of this conversation, we've been worrying that there isn't enough of this  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:22):**  good stuff going on. There isn't enough woodland being integrated. But I want to come at this  from a slightly different perspective, because farmers are increasingly being paid for public  goods and services and tree planting is in one form or another is fairly easy to monetise,  
**[0:31:35-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:35):**  either through selling carbon sequestration and storage or simply through selling land  for forestry or for that matter development. So, how concerned are you that Britain's ability  to feed itself might be undermined by a drive for too many forests?  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:31:51):**  Not at all concerned. Actually, when we look at our landscape use and what farmers produce  from that land, much isn't food for people. If the concern is feeding the nation and delivering  healthy quality food, well, that should be a priority for our best landscape and best  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:06):**  soils. Currently, we produce, I think 60% of the grains we produce go to feed animals.  We produce up to one and a half million tonnes a week to go into bioethanol, several hundred  thousand hectares of quality, grade one to land going into maize, rhino-elk digestion.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:23):**  So, if it's about food production, we can actually really shift the dial and we can  put so much more nature, habitats, trees within our landscape and it doesn't have to be one  or the other. We can add lots more trees and add crops in between them. We could add livestock  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:38):**  in between them. So, we haven't got to be joined up and has it got to be a sheep or  a cow or something like that? Or can it be deer? What is the food output? Could it be  fruit and nuts? So, I just find the argument around this food security and food production  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:32:53):**  that just completely the wrong narrative we should be talking around and we should be  focused around what is the need from our landscape? What are the market drivers? What do I get  rewarded from? But also, how do we keep a working farmed landscape? The outputs may  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:07):**  change. We may have less livestock and more trees because that's where the reward is.  We may have more greenhouses and food production in warehouses and underground. We can change  that, but we need to help the farmers stay farming and even on a tentative sector. I  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:22):**  think some of the big problems we have with some of the grants for trees, if you're the  landlord and your tenant is coming up for a renegotiation of a tenancy, it is quite  lucrative for some to actually say, well, remove the tenant, we'll just plant the trees.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:38):**  And actually, we need to get the tenants to understand there is an opportunity for them  to have a role in those trees and earn some income managing those trees and being involved  in that different landscape use. It's not about one or the other. It's about a joined  
**[0:33:51-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:33:51):**  up approach. Again, coming back to multifunction land use  and phrases that sort of leap out for me while you were talking there, you know, that we  need land appropriate food, not food that's just grown on whatever land because a farmer  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:05):**  thinks that there's a market for it there. It's what food is appropriate for that and  increasingly moving to food for humans rather than feed for livestock. Thanks very much  for that, Martin. Andy, thinking not just of Britain, but around the world, I wonder  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:19):**  if you have examples where forestry and food production have been really well integrated.  I've got a new phrase now, which is timber appropriate land. And I think sometimes it's,  as Martin was saying, it's looking at, we tend to have quite a limited timber crop in  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:33):**  terms of focusing on a few species because of the land that we're growing it on. And  I think if we're looking at a more holistic approach and more wider landscapes, we'll  be growing more timber on a wider variety of land and we've grown a wider variety of  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:34:45):**  crops. If you look at, I was going to say, look at other parts of Europe that have higher  levels of tree and woodland cover. And you often see farms having timber and forests  integrated into that farm landscape. So France and Germany both have about 30% tree cover,  
**[0:35:01-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:01):**  woodland cover. And compared to the UK, it's about 12, as you were saying before, about  12, 13%. So I think it's kind of looking at outcomes versus symptoms, if you like.  If we did have more integrated landscape approaches to food and to forestry and to recreation  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:18):**  and access, then we would have a higher level of tree cover. So yeah, I've got friends who  farm, live just outside in Germany near Karlsruhe. And there's a small land holding, but they  have areas of intensive food production near the town. And then they have access into the  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:34):**  wider forest further out. I think it is about that blending of different land uses. And  I think, I was interested, USA is another interesting example where they talk about  family forest owners. I lived, I hope in my lifetime we can talk about family forest owners  
**[0:35:48-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:35:48):**  in the UK. And they talk about what they call plantation forestry, often they call it tree  farms. I've got a tree farm. And I just think that's kind of much more honest about this  is a tree farm. I am farming trees for a purpose. And I quite like that. And I think that one  
**[0:36:03-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:03):**  of the challenges then is patterns of land ownership in the UK. And I think in the UK  at the moment, we have a fairly narrow range of people. Well, historically, we've had a  narrow range of people growing timber. So there's kind of the state and the Forest Commission  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:15):**  and our W Scottish forestry. And then we have some large investment funds and a number of  larger states and they tend to have a fairly narrow range of management objectives. I think  if we had more farmers, more landowners owning forests and growing timber, then we'd find  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:29):**  new ways to do that integration. So agroforestry is great, silvopastral. But as Martin said,  the more people we have doing this, then we're saying, well, you could try this and people  going on, I'm trying this, I'm trying that. And I think we'd have new ways of integration  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:42):**  and at different scales. And I think that's, it's looking at our low woodland cover is  a symptom of other things. It is a problem, but it's a symptom of other problems. So if  we want to change that, then we need to think carefully about how we change that and what  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:36:56):**  are the drivers to make those changes? It strikes me that there's a potential sort  of infrastructure challenge there as well. And in the same way that we find, you know,  as, as more people, more farmers are taking on agroecology and regenerative farming practices  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:11):**  and integrating livestock within perhaps what was previously an arable rotation, there's  a need for a rethink of the whole way that we approach slaughter, for example, so that  there are more small slaughterhouses dotted around the country. And I wonder if there's  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:24):**  a sort of similar challenge when it comes to processing timber products that at the  moment, if you've got a big plantation, then you can have a processing unit next to that.  And that's quite straightforward. Do we need to sort of review the way that a woodland  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:37):**  infrastructure works as well?  Yes, that's the easy, easy answer. We've got some very big, very efficient, really, really  efficient sawmills and timber processes in the UK. And they're very good at turning a  
**[0:37:49-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:37:49):**  crooked irregular cone into square products, which is what sawmilling, a simplification  of sawmilling, but that's what it is. And you know, particularly in Scotland, a huge  amount of investment in getting the most out of our timber crop and getting the most of  
**[0:38:03-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:03):**  that timber into higher value timber products. But absolutely, we don't want to be hauling  round timber huge distances. And it's a lot of the weight is wet timbers, you know, what  we want is the volume of the timber, not the weight of the timber, and we're hauling a  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:17):**  lot of timber around. And I think again, that goes back to this land ownership and objectives  of woodland owning, we could be processing more timber on the farm on farms in in local  estates, we always used to you know, most most estates used to have their own sawmill,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:32):**  and they used to process timber on the estate for their own use. And that's slightly gone  out of fashion. But there's, there's lots of good examples already of people having  things like woodmiser sawmills and smaller sawbenches set up to process timber locally  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:45):**  add value to it and for it to be used locally. The big processes are great. And I've got  lots of friends who work at the big processes. And that investment is usually needed and  that that drives investment elsewhere. But yeah, I think that that looking at that timber  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:38:58):**  infrastructure and that's more smaller sawmills, but then also how do we get more timber onto  onto the rails? How do we have fewer timber trucks on the road often on narrow rural roads?  Can we get a shift more of that timber onto rail infrastructure and process more of it  
**[0:39:14-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:14):**  locally? So again, it's this this idea of shortening supply chains and sticky money  again that you process, you add value to the food or you add value to the timber locally.  So in many ways, the challenges that face forestry are actually the same challenges  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:28):**  that face agriculture. And so it really makes sense to integrate the conversations that  we're having around these and I love I love those phrases that you used earlier about  timber appropriate land and family forest owners. Those are those are fabulous. And  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:41):**  they ring very true with with thinking about farming. And we've previously discussed and  I think you know, we're coming naturally to this question, aren't we about the need for  a proper land use strategy in Britain. First of all, do you think that's important? I think  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:39:55):**  you do from conversations we've had. But who would you see as being the major stakeholders  in a strategic process? And what would you hope that a land use strategy would actually  change on the ground?  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:06):**  Ian I talk a lot about land use strategy. And  then I have a slightly nightmarish vision of a lot of meetings and workshops and then  a thick strategic document being produced, having everyone spent a lot of energy and  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:16):**  it just sits on a shelf and then has has kind of limited impact. So maybe again, it's kind  of symptoms and since what's the problem? What's the symptom of the problem? And maybe  the challenge isn't just a strategy, but kind of strategic, strategic thinking, I would  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:29):**  like to see if we're talking about a land use strategy, then some of those major stakeholders  might be the construction sector, it might be people who are researchers working on bio  plastics and bio economy, it's certainly got to include local communities and people who  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:43):**  are living and work working in these wider landscapes. So I think the idea of a land  use strategy, it's kind of why do we need a land use strategy? How do we make the best  decisions about land use? How do we make best decisions about land use change about the  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:40:57):**  there's a fundamental change going on in in UK agriculture at the moment with the change  away from the basic payment systems in its various forms in the various in the various  parts of the UK, but also that when we're thinking about having a post Brexit and about  
**[0:41:11-0:41:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:11):**  how where do we get our food from? How do we as Martin was saying, what crops do we  want to use for what purposes? And then, you know, if we're going to be growing a lot of  timber, a lot more trees, where do we do that? How do we do that? Who should do that? I think  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:23):**  without some form of strategy or some basic form of decision making framework, or at least  a vision? I thought, yeah, and I was talking about a vision later on, but yeah, no, just  a vision of your what we want our rural areas to look like, do we want them to be World  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:37):**  Heritage Sites and pick a point in time of some kind of perfect vision of kind of Edwardian  countryside or do you want something different? And I think that's, that's the challenge.  And I think so I'm always nervous about kind of expanding protected areas sometimes because  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:41:50):**  the protection areas often is looking at kind of a vision of the landscape and we kind of  say, that's what we want that landscape that point in time, and landscapes aren't like  that landscapes are dynamic and landscapes driven by people and natural events. So yeah,  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:03):**  so a strategy, but as I say, strategic thinking. And then I think, again, if you look within,  I'll pick on Defra, if you look at, you know, the people at a senior level in Defra, you  know, have we got the right people at that senior level? Should we have more construction  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:16):**  people sitting on the board of Defra? There's lots of eminent science scientists on the  US Advisory Council, but there's no forest scientists, no construction scientists. Again,  it's the strategy versus strategic thinking. And I think I think a vision is the key thing.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:31):**  Here, what's what's our vision for our rural areas? Do we want them to be full of Airbnbs  and second homes? Do we want dynamic thriving communities, the whole housing challenge in  rural areas is a huge problem. All these things are interconnected. And I think it's that  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:42:45):**  challenge of seeing, having this forest is a problem here. And Airbnbs are a problem  there. Access to health services is a problem there. And all these things are interconnected.  And I think there's just a real and it is a huge challenge for governments and government  
**[0:43:00-0:43:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:00):**  departments not to have a to have that vision to have that strategic thinking. I want a  land use strategy, but I don't want a thick document that sits on a shelf and doesn't  do anything.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:11):**  Martin, what do you think about, you know, a land use vision or strategy? Do you think  that's something that's needed or is the natural push and pull between private sector requirements  and government policy already delivering, you know, reasonable land use outcomes already?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:26):**  I think we need something if we leave it to the marketplace and the leaders, the government  will pull in policy and bits. We may not get the best outcomes in the right places and  some market might lead in the wrong direction when we look back in what we do. I've always  
**[0:43:40-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:40):**  thought we needed a strategy, but I'm more coming to the conclusion the governments,  national government don't want to do a top down, but we do need a land use framework.  We know climate is going to change some of our most productive soils and the fennel may  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:43:53):**  be underwater in 50 years time. Some other areas may see increased droughts. We need  to understand the bigger plan of what's going to happen to our countryside and our landscape  with the climate change is coming. So we need that framework of what are the challenges  
**[0:44:07-0:44:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:07):**  as from a national framework and from national governments, what are the opportunities, the  challenges, where do we need to put infrastructure, where do we need to put food production, timber  and other things. And then I think it really needs to go down to a local framework and  
**[0:44:21-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:21):**  strategy because it's local people and local communities and councils and land managers  that can actually tailor the outputs of what's needed. We know where the right trees may  go with some advice. We know which bits of land are most productive or may flood or we  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:37):**  may need to put some housing there or infrastructure. But I do think we need that framework from  the national governments and from defers and structurally joined up right across the UK.  Even though we've got devolved governments, we need that joined up because just because  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:44:52):**  there's a line in the map, it doesn't mean it stops one side or the other. And then we  need the local and regional bits to take ownership of some of this and set out some clear strategy  of what do we need, what is the best use, because then that follows on where do we put  
**[0:45:05-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:05):**  the timber manufacturing plants, where do we put the new abattoirs and the other infrastructure  things we will need from that strategy.  Jason Vale, Director of  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:13):**  And Martin, you talk to government quite a bit. Do you get a sense that there is an appetite  for this? Is it already happening in any form?  Martin  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:20):**  There's no appetite whatsoever. They are not keen at all in doing a land use strategy  and top down approach. In England, it will go down to the local councils to do local  nature recovery plans and local structures. It really concerns me we don't have a vision  
**[0:45:37-0:45:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:37):**  across the top and a framework of actually the bigger challenges we have for a smallish  island with lots of people and lots of demand on the landscape. Okay, so what are the priorities?  What is the vision of, we know government wants 30,000 hectares per year of trees planted.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:45:52):**  So okay, we could deliver that. Where do we put them? We don't want just one or two blocks,  they need to be across the landscape, but then we need to put the infrastructure in,  we need the timber processing places and the other opportunities and structure putting  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:04):**  in. Currently, we don't see that and I don't hear that coming from the government. And  that for me, that's really concerning as a land manager, will I be doing the right things  in the future that society wants? Or will I just take a marketplace approach and someone  
**[0:46:17-0:46:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:17):**  who offers me the most money and do something when particularly in trees and other things,  that's a 30, 40, 50 year window. If I grow a crop as an arable farmer, next year, I can  do a different crop. I have only changed land use for a 12 month period, but some of this  
**[0:46:32-0:46:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:32):**  bigger infrastructure stuff that's going to need to happen and will happen because of  climate change, we need that structure and plan in place. And I certainly push it as  often as I can. I was talking to parts of Dethwa this morning and I was certainly pushing  
**[0:46:46-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:46):**  that point that actually we need that vision and the plan to know how we stitch it all  together in the future. Fantastic. That's really interesting. Now,  Andy, just finally, I want to sort of take a long view. We've been talking throughout  
**[0:46:57-0:47:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:46:57):**  this about the importance of woodlands and forests. Clearly they play a critical role  for business, for mitigating and adapting to climate change and for nature restoration.  And gradually trees are being reintegrated into farm systems. So thinking forward 20  
**[0:47:12-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:12):**  years, if you were travelling around Britain a generation from now, how different do you  think that countryside, that landscape would look? The easy answer to that is I'd like  to see more trees and woodlands and more woodlands in better management, whether that's for biodiversity  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:25):**  or for recreation or for timber or ideally a combination of all three. A few years ago,  I was involved in a researcher called Vanessa Burton, who did some work on attitudes around  forest expansion in Scotland. And she produced some really great kind of stylised landscape  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:40):**  images of a landscape would look like within more trees and managed for different purposes.  And if you Google Vanessa Burton and Green Gold, you should find her blog and these images.  But I think that's going back to what Martin was saying before, is always that challenge  
**[0:47:52-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:47:52):**  of sort of, yeah, no, we want more trees or we want more timber or we want more woodland,  but kind of not here, kind of somewhere else. I think we do need that vision in that landscape.  So yeah, more trees and more woodlands managed, you know, not just plunk, not just done for  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:06):**  the ground, done for a purpose. And that purpose might be biodiversity, it might be growing  timber, it might be to have more access on the edge of towns where there's a huge demand  for countryside access, let's plant some more trees there and let's have multi-purpose woodlands  
**[0:48:21-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:21):**  on the edge of towns and more that connection between communities and people and woodlands.  So whether that's more woodland owned and managed by local councils or more woodlands  and trees on farms and managed and owned by local communities, that shorter supply chain,  
**[0:48:37-0:48:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:37):**  what we're talking about that kind of infrastructure of sawmilling and construction. I think it'd  be great to see more timber construction in rural areas intact. I mean, there's a lot  of CLT being built in central London, there's almost more CLT in central London than there  
**[0:48:52-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:48:52):**  is in the rural areas. You know, when we could be building this huge demand for rural housing,  we could be building that out of locally sourced, locally grown material and keeping that money,  keeping that investment in local communities. And I think if we had more timber construction,  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:09):**  and then that would be a radical game changer in people's attitudes towards growing timber.  And people can see that forest there is going to build these homes here. It's not just going  on a timber truck and disappearing. Some of it is staying locally, some of it will always  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:22):**  go to a big sawmill in the same way as some agriculture will be large scale. I think that  would be a real game changer is people seeing that connection between woodlands on their  doorstep and the products and materials that they use.  
**[0:49:34-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Forestry--land-use-e1g6bod#t=0:49:34):**  That's fantastic. Thanks so much, bro. That's all we've got time for.

### Farm Gate  (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:05:12)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to FarmGate, I'm Finlow Costain. This programme is part of a series in which  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:10):**  I talk to farmers who are delivering agro-ecological agriculture on their farms. The farmers in  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:15):**  this series are working with the Soil Association as Agroecology Ambassadors and as part of  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:19):**  their 10 Years for Agroecology project. The series has also been inspired by the Food  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:25):**  Farming and Countryside Commission's work on farming for change. As Agroecology Ambassadors,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:30):**  the farmers in these programmes are inviting people, virtually of course, onto their farms  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:34):**  to help develop a better understanding of what agro-ecological farming entails. Today  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:39):**  we're looking at mixed farming and I'm joined by two superb farmers, both tenant farmers,  
**[0:00:44-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:44):**  who are putting agro-ecological principles into action.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:47):**  Ben Andrews farms at Broadwood Hall in Herefordshire. He farms beef, cereals and veg, with his father  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:53):**  in around 600 acres of organic land. He can be found on Twitter and on Instagram under  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:00:58):**  the handle at BenTheoAndrews. Robert Wilson farms at Cowbog Farm in the Scottish Borders.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:04):**  They have around 250 head of beef cattle, but the stars of the show, they say, are their  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:09):**  Romany Hereford herd. You can find Robert on Twitter under the handle at FarmandKitchen,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:14):**  or on Instagram as at Wilson's Farm and Kitchen. Welcome both. To start us off, I wonder if  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:19):**  you could just briefly describe your farm and tell us what you produce and what agroecology  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:24):**  really means for you. And Ben, I wonder if I can come to you first.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:28):**  So our farm split over two sites. So there's 450 acres, which is down on what's called  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:35):**  the Hereford Lowlands. We've got the River Arrow right through the middle of it. That  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:39):**  floods the river meadows annually, which is where we graze the cattle. Then we have some  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:45):**  really top notch grade one and two agricultural land that we grow our cereals and vegetables  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:51):**  on. Being a mixed farm, of course, everything's interconnected. The cattle, when they're in  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:01:55):**  the sheds, they're housed on nice fresh straw. And then in the spring, summer, sheds are  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:01):**  mucked out and the manure goes to fertiliser ground.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:03):**  So just to clarify, I mean, I said 600 acres and you said 450. There's a bit of a discrepancy.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:09):**  And that's the 100thâ€¦ You've got the new farm as well, but we'll come to that. And  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:13):**  that's your extra 150 acres. I wonder if you could just sort of sum up, you know, what  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:17):**  agroecology means for you and, you know, why you think of yourself as an agroecological  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:21):**  farmer.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:22):**  Well, we've been organic now for 20 years this year. The initial change to organic farming,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:27):**  you think, well, organic is just conventional farming, but without the inputs. So without  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:32):**  the synthetic fertilisers and the synthetic pesticides. But you need to think about it  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:38):**  in an ecosystem point of view. So you need to be encouraging natural predators to control  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:44):**  the pests because you don't have synthetic pesticides to use. You need to look at ways  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:49):**  to build soil fertility without the help of synthetic fertilisers because you've got  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:55):**  no other way of doing it. And if you don't build fertility, then you have poor soil health  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:02:59):**  and you can't grow crops. So you have to really think about working with nature instead  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:04):**  of against it to really make the most of farming without any chemical inputs.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:09):**  And Robert, what is it that you farm?  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:11):**  We farm, well, the 250 head of herefits that you mentioned and also some arable ground,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:18):**  which is predominantly malting barley for the brewing and distilling industry.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:23):**  And what about agroecology for you? What do you think it is that you do differently from  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:27):**  a standard conventional farmer?  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:29):**  Well, although we're conventional, which is probably slightly different to some of the  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:33):**  other Soil Association ambassadors, we try and farm with nature in mind and with the  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:39):**  biodiversity in mind. We're an alolan farm similar to Ben that floods quite a lot in  
**[0:03:44-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:44):**  the bottom and we've got a lot of water margins and watercourses. So we've made a conscious  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:49):**  decision to fence off as many of those as possible so stock can't get in. Where there's  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:54):**  an arable field, we've got a six metre grass margin alongside these watercourses.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:03:59):**  Now you talked about having your 250 herefits and you have pedigree herefits as well. I  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:05):**  think that's a smaller number, isn't it? And how big is the pedigree herd?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:09):**  Of the 250, we've got 70 pedigree hereford cows and they are followers. So we've probably  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:15):**  got about 170 pedigree herefits in total and the rest are commercial cattle. It takes up  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:22):**  most of the time the pedigrees are feeding the stock. So certainly over the winter, you're  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:26):**  looking after them in the sheds very similar to what Ben's doing. Some of the commercial  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:30):**  cattle are still outside on root crops.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:33):**  Fantastic. Now, you're both tenant farmers and so I think it's worth sort of having just  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:37):**  a chat through that element a little bit. Ben, your family have been tenants on the  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:41):**  land since the 1930s. I think you're third generation. I just wonder how being the tenant  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:46):**  rather than the owner affects the decisions that you're able to make about the farm.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:50):**  There are definitely certain things that we can't do and we have to apply for permission  
**[0:04:55-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:04:55):**  to do such as use of buildings or where we could maybe add some value somewhere else.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:02):**  It's not quite as straightforward as just cracking on with renting out extra shed space  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:08):**  to someone else. There are other things like planting trees. I'm keen to look at planting  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:14):**  more trees on the farm, but again, this is something that needs to be discussed with  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:19):**  the landlord. But the other thing, of course, being tenants is that you have to make every  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:24):**  acre count. We don't own this farm. We've got no equity in it. So, when we leave, we  
**[0:05:30-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:30):**  just walk away from it and it's just despite being here for 90 years. So, you really do  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:37):**  have to think about what can I do to make this work? You have that rent check to pay  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:44):**  every month and you need to be making money from it, which a lot of people will say that  
**[0:05:50-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:50):**  being organic farmers or agroecological farmers is not as commercially viable as conventional  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:05:57):**  farming. But like I said, we've been doing it for 20 years, so we're still here.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:02):**  And Robert, you're also a tenant. You've got two farms under your control as well and you've  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:06):**  got different tenancy agreements. One's on a secure tenancy.  
**[0:06:09-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:09):**  The secure tenancy, which is on Cowrog farm, it was started in 1938 by my grandfather.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:16):**  He came into the farm. It's much more secure. Ben talked about the equity. Well, we can  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:21):**  get compensation for improvements that we've done to the land and we've done to the farm  
**[0:06:26-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:26):**  over those last 80 years. Recently, the Scottish government and the Tenant Farming Commission  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:33):**  have been shoring up those regulations about leaving and what you can be refunded for.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:40):**  It gives you a little bit more security.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:42):**  My understanding is that security is generational as well, that if you have successors that  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:49):**  want to take the farm on from within the family, then it's secure for them too.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:53):**  Yeah, we could pass our lease on to any blood relative who can fit the criteria to look  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:06:58):**  after the land and look after the farm properly. And that's gone further now. Any tenant farmer  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:03):**  who wants to retire can assign the lease to a new entrant or a progressive farmer on the  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:09):**  understanding that the landlord doesn't want to take the lease back in hand himself. So,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:14):**  if he does that, he has to compensate the tenant. So, there is a little bit more equity  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:18):**  involved in leases now.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:20):**  So, Ben, clearly Scottish law is different to English law.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:23):**  I'd say we are fairly secure. We're on a three-generation, it's called Agricultural Holdings Act tenancy,  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:30):**  which is a fantastic tenancy to be on. And my dad renegotiated, so he's the first tenant,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:36):**  I'll be the second. And then so if I have kids and they want to farm, then they'll have  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:41):**  the right to be the third. Improvements to the buildings are a little harder. So, we're  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:46):**  on a full repairing and ensuring tenancy. So, we're responsible for the buildings. If  
**[0:07:51-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:51):**  we put a building up, then we can get it down as tenants' improvements. But that's only  
**[0:07:58-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:07:58):**  if they agree to it. And after 25 years, it then automatically becomes their property.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:05):**  Whereas if we wanted to put a shed up and they didn't agree, it would be tenants' fixtures.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:10):**  And when we came to the end of the tenancy, we'd have to take it with us.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:14):**  So that's tenancy and that's your farms on tenancy. Well, Ben, you've just bought 150  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:19):**  acres up on hillier ground, which must be fantastic for a whole range of reasons. First  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:23):**  of all, it won't flood in quite the same way. But also it's your own. You can do whatever  
**[0:08:27-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:27):**  you want to do with it.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:28):**  I'm so excited about it because it is a really beautiful 150 acres of ring fenced land. The  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:35):**  main farm that we're tenants on is on the edge of the town. It's got a road running  
**[0:08:39-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:39):**  through the middle of it, another main road and a railway track on the edge of it. So,  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:45):**  it's not quite the bucolic idyll that a lot of people might think farming is. So, up in  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:50):**  the hills, it is absolutely stunning. We've got some incredible features like gullies  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:08:54):**  with these massive oak and ash trees shooting up out of them and gets a bit more snow up  
**[0:09:01-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:01):**  there. So quiet. And it's perfect for conversion to organic ground, which is what we've done  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:07):**  from 1st of January. It's in organic conversion and also enrolled into the mid-tier countryside  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:13):**  stewardship scheme as well. So, there's some things we're going to be doing up there to  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:17):**  encourage wild birds and just generally to boosting biodiversity.  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:22):**  It's ruminants on there.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:23):**  It's going to be keeping on with the mixed theme. So, there will be some fantastic grazing.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:28):**  There's some lovely patches of woodland for woodland grazing, spring fed ponds for watering  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:33):**  over the borehole up there as well. But yeah, there will be also some arable land into the  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:38):**  rotation where we will grow whole crop silage and some spring beans, just all keeping it  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:44):**  growing all our own feed for our cattle. We're not no-till. It's quite hard getting onto  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:50):**  the no-till bandwagon as organic. We do plough, but we also integrate long clover lays. So,  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:09:56):**  we've got five years of fertility building clover to help boost nitrogen, but also organic  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:03):**  matter as well.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:04):**  When we've spoken in the past, you've talked about the area being great for agroforestry.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:07):**  And I wonder if you have a sense of, you know, what does that mean for you? What do you hope  
**[0:10:11-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:11):**  to do? What, in a perfect world, what would you like to do? And would that planting be  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:15):**  integrated with the stock or separate from the stock?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:18):**  Well, to integrate more silvopasture into the system. So, that's woodland grazing, being  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:24):**  able to plant some trees that can be harvested for firewood or for, you know, general energy  
**[0:10:29-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:29):**  crops through pollarding. But also the trees, different trees are beneficial to cattle in  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:36):**  different ways, you know, as natural wormers. And they will, then browsing animals, cattle  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:41):**  aren't designed to just graze one variety of grass. In the wild, ruminants would have  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:47):**  taken a little bit from this plant, a little bit from that plant. And so, just trying to  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:51):**  reintroduce a bit more of a natural habitat for them.  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:54):**  Robert, just going back to your pedigree, Romany Hereford's, they're at the centre of  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:10:57):**  your business and you also produce beef and malting barley for the whisky industry. What  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:01):**  made you choose the products that you produce?  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:04):**  I think the farm did, basically. It suited, I don't want to sound like a traditional farmer  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:09):**  saying, oh, just what my grandfather did. It does suit the land we've got and suit the  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:14):**  land. The cattle are very easy doing. They suit our permanent grassland that we graze  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:20):**  them on. We've got very few grass lays. The only ones we've got are in the arable rotation  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:25):**  just to retain a bit of organic matter and give the soil a rest. So, they suit the land  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:30):**  that we're grazing them on. And the malting barley, we've got fairly light land and it  
**[0:11:35-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:35):**  doesn't suit big wheat crops. So, it suits to growing low nitrogen.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:40):**  So with the barley, you're moving that, you're rotating that around the farm as well?  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:45):**  Yes, we tend to grow it for a few years in the same field and then break it up with grass  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:50):**  or root crops for the cows. And we've also got a neighbour that grows some broccoli on  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:55):**  our land if we feel we need something just a little different.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:11:59):**  As an agroecological farmer, are you sort of taking steps to reduce the amount of fertilisers  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:03):**  and so on that you're using?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:05):**  Yeah, we're lucky being a mixed farm that we've got a lot of access to farmyard manure,  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:10):**  which can go back into the system and go back into the soil and provide nutrients that way.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:16):**  With the grass lays, certainly we've got fairly high percentage of red clover in those lays  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:22):**  and that again fixes a lot of nitrogen in the soil. A lot of the less productive land  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:27):**  we have put over to environmental crops, especially down by our riverside. It's very, very light  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:33):**  land there. It suits us better to put those into crops that last all year, providing a  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:39):**  negative source and a food source for birds over the winter, a nesting habitat for ground  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:45):**  nesting birds in the spring. And even if we don't make any money on that, we were losing  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:50):**  money when we were trying to grow crops on it. So it fits our system.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:54):**  So do you find yourself using chemical sprays in addition to those measures that you've  
**[0:12:58-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:58):**  talked about?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:12:59):**  We do. We use as little as possible, but we do need to... A lot of the crops being a bit  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:05):**  further north, the weather can be a bit inclement and we need to watch the likes of fungicides.  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:12):**  We don't use pesticides on the arable crops, but we do use herbicides and fungicides.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:18):**  What level of control would you say that you have over your routes to market? I mean, I  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:22):**  imagine with the pedigree herd, you're much more in the position of being price makers  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:27):**  rather than price takers, but are you sort of fixed into contracts and have limited control  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:33):**  over the other things? Or do you feel that you have some measure of control?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:36):**  We've got some measure of control in that you can look at the future markets and see  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:41):**  what price you can get at harvest time next year. So last week on a bit of land that we  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:46):**  contract farm for our landlord, we sold the wheat for next November at a price that I  
**[0:13:51-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:51):**  thought was economic for us to do so. And again, with the crops we've got in the ground  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:13:57):**  or we will put in the ground in March and April, we can take a price now for selling  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:01):**  them at harvest. So it is the market price, but we can choose when to take it or we can  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:07):**  have a gamble and just see what it's like at harvest. With the beef side of the business,  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:11):**  like you say, the pedigree stock, we can be price makers on that and we can also make  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:16):**  a better price by producing or demand a better price by producing better cattle. The beef  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:21):**  side of it, the cattle aren't good enough for selling as pedigree cattle. Some of those  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:26):**  were probably our price takers, but we're trying to increase the price we can get by  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:31):**  selling a bit more beef directly to consumers.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:34):**  Ben, you produce vegetables, cereals and beef. You contract it to M&S, I think, for your  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:39):**  beef. What happens to the cereals and the veggies?  
**[0:14:42-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:42):**  The cereals, most of them actually end up going for stock feed, but if we can get the  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:49):**  right spec on the oats, then we have managed to get them to organic porridge oats, which  
**[0:14:54-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:14:54):**  is fantastic. The vegetables all go to Able and Cole. It's a big box scheme that operates  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:02):**  across the whole of England now, mostly in the UK as well, I think. They are a fantastic  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:07):**  company to deal with. We are at that sort of stage where we are probably growing too  
**[0:15:13-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:13):**  much to just serve locally, but not quite big enough to go into supermarkets. So there  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:18):**  aren't many spaces within that. So finding someone like Able and Cole that are fair to  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:24):**  deal with, who you can have a constructive conversation about prices and that don't screw  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:30):**  you over when you're unable to fulfil an order, it's really refreshing, especially considering  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:35):**  I speak to friends who have supermarket contracts and when it goes right, it goes really bright.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:41):**  But then if they don't want something, they will find any excuse to reject it. So it's  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:47):**  nice to be working with people who are so fair, really. With the beef, like you said,  
**[0:15:53-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:15:53):**  the M&S contract is great, but I'd like to supply more locally. Over the past few years,  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:01):**  there's been quite an issue with the number of abattoirs really decreasing and there's  
**[0:16:05-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:05):**  been just the growth of three or four major players, like ADP or Foil. It just means that  
**[0:16:13-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:13):**  there are much fewer organic certified slaughterhouses to send your cattle to. So where we are, the  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:20):**  closest is Ellesmere, which is a good over an hour's drive away. And with a push by the  
**[0:16:25-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:25):**  government to reduce the amount of time that animals can spend in transit to an abattoir,  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:31):**  it's really something needs to happen to maybe bring a few smaller ones back because the  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:36):**  small ones around us are just too small. One thing I would just point out is that from  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:40):**  the COVID outbreak, if they had an outbreak in these meat processing factories, it would  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:46):**  shut them down. And that meant that if they're shut down, that's doing a lot more damage  
**[0:16:50-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:50):**  than say one or two localised food processing centres getting shut down would be. So we  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:16:57):**  actually had some cattle having to travel to Glasgow because that was the nearest place  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:02):**  to send them. That doesn't sit right with me.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:04):**  Mason. Absolutely. And I guess with all things, what we're talking about with agriculture, land use, the types  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:10):**  of products that are being produced, the type of slaughterhouse, it's diversity. It's trying  
**[0:17:15-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:15):**  to make sure that there is something that serves all different stages, different scales  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:20):**  of production, and that that's available to people when they need it. You've got 11 hectares  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:26):**  of vegetables. And I just wonder about your growing season, what you actually produce,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:30):**  how that works.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:31):**  Well, like Robert, we've come to know what we can grow on our farm. So we've tried pretty  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:37):**  much every vegetable going in the past and you just learn what grows well and what doesn't.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:42):**  So things like carrots don't tend to do as well because our soil can get quite heavy.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:47):**  And if it's a little bit wet, then you end up with some really muddy carrots and nobody  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:51):**  loves muddy carrots. So we've settled on salad crops. So lettuce is probably our biggest  
**[0:17:56-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:17:56):**  and brassica is sort of what, it's about 50-50. So kale, cabbage, cauliflower. We seem to  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:03):**  grow those incredibly well. And I've got a friend who is a brassica agronomist down in  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:09):**  Cornwall and he came up and visited about a year ago now and looked around the farm  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:14):**  and he said, to be fair, these are growing as well as most of the conventional crops  
**[0:18:19-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:19):**  I see.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:20):**  There's a lot of talk, isn't there, about, you know, growing lettuce and things like  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:23):**  that in big stacked systems in old industrial sites or down on the London Underground. Have  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:29):**  you got subways tunnelled out on your farm or is it outside?  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:32):**  Well, I think the infrastructure costs of building that would take some paying back  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:38):**  when we've got such fantastic, rich, fertile soil that we can just grow it in so effortlessly.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:44):**  In the city centres, then I think these could maybe be answers to food shortages, but I'm  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:50):**  not that keen on growing all our food in sanitised boxes. I quite like the idea of getting a  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:18:56):**  little bit of dirt on my cabbage and eating that.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:00):**  Absolutely. So, Robert, over the last 20 years or so, you talked about the fact that you've  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:04):**  made lots of ecological changes, ecological improvements. And I wonder, when we've talked  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:09):**  in the past, you said that, you know, there's a price tag attached to these things. So,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:13):**  I wonder what sort of things you've done and where you managed to find the funding to do  
**[0:19:17-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:17):**  what you've done.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:18):**  Well, we started about 20 years ago trying to improve the biodiversity in the farm, taking  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:22):**  these unproductive areas of land out of mainly cereal production. So, at that time there  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:28):**  was funding available and quite a lot of funding. So, there were capital payments that we could  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:33):**  fence off these areas, we could put new hedges in. Then in these areas we planted a mixture  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:39):**  of crops. So, imagine a bowl of muesli and just putting that on the ground and you've  
**[0:19:43-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:43):**  got oats and barley and maybe not cranberries, but you had fodder radish and sunflowers and  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:50):**  a really purple crop called phacelia. Phacelia is really good because it's great for bees  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:19:54):**  and it's great for birds as well. So, we put these in and we were paid for doing so and  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:00):**  that provided, you know, provided a great boost for nature on what had been a farm that,  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:06):**  as Ben mentioned, you tried to work hard to make a return from every acre. So, it wasn't  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:11):**  a crop or it wasn't grass. So, the funding was there to do that and it has been there  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:15):**  to do that over the last 20 years, but on a diminishing amount. I guess I've got a slight  
**[0:20:20-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:20):**  concern at the moment that these funds are, there might be a bit of a gap for two or three  
**[0:20:24-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:24):**  years until our new agricultural system in Scotland is worked out as to what's happening  
**[0:20:31-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:31):**  in 2024. My concern on the agri-cology point of view is whether there will be consistent  
**[0:20:38-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:38):**  funding.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:39):**  Do you feel that if the funding does reduce as a result of Brexit, that you'll be less  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:46):**  able because you're in this position as a tenant farmer of needing to make every acre  
**[0:20:50-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:50):**  count as you both talked about, do you feel that there is a danger that you won't be able  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:55):**  to do as much in terms of the ecology on your farm? Or do you think you're in a position  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:20:59):**  now where, you know, you've been doing it for 20 years and you can kind of just get  
**[0:21:02-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:02):**  on with it even if there is a dip?  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:04):**  Yeah, I think we will and certainly the areas that are fenced off, there's absolutely no  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:08):**  reason because they were fenced off for a reason and that was because they were unproductive.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:12):**  The only way I could see them coming out of the management options that we are using them  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:18):**  for is if they were going back to grass and I can't see us taking out a fence to put them  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:22):**  back to grass for a short term period. The fact they're fenced off means there would  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:27):**  be the option to plant trees on them with a little bit more investment in fencing.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:31):**  Ben, your main farm's down on the flood plain and I think you were saying something like  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:35):**  a third of it gets flooded for a couple of months and even one year recently it was six  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:40):**  months. That's pretty serious, that's a lot of your land that's had a production for a  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:44):**  long time. How does it affect your management?  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:46):**  Well, one of the reasons that we have put it all to permanent pasture is in the past  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:51):**  that we had tried growing things on there and we'd lost that game far too many times.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:21:58):**  So putting grass there is about one of the best things you can do because you've got  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:03):**  permanent grass, deep roots, it helps with the infiltration so it can hold a lot more  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:10):**  water. If you're ploughing it, there are a lot of farms along the river, gets ploughed  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:15):**  and then heavy rainfall, you get a lot of topsoil runoff into the water, into the rivers,  
**[0:22:20-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:20):**  which is an absolute disaster for wildlife. So we've saved some recovery from flooding,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:28):**  so 2019, from the 1st of October 2019 until sometime in March in 2020 our flood land was  
**[0:22:36-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:36):**  pretty much constantly under water. We had two of the worst floods we'd ever had and  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:42):**  so if you think, I think at parts it was about five foot under water. So if you can imagine  
**[0:22:47-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:47):**  five foot of water for six months pressing down on grass, there's not going to be an  
**[0:22:53-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:22:53):**  awful lot alive in that soil by the end of it. So when it dried up, we go through it  
**[0:23:00-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:00):**  with a subsoiler, just help alleviate some compaction and it's amazing how some of these  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:07):**  old river meadows just recover, they just bounce back. We found we don't have to do  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:11):**  a lot of reseeding or anything like that. There were patches where the extensive water  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:16):**  had just completely ruined it but you can throw a little bit of grass seed on top of  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:21):**  it and it bounces back. But the good old grass species that are there, you know, they've  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:27):**  developed to be there because they can take a bit of a beating from some water.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:31):**  Jason Vale Just again, because you know, not everybody  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:33):**  who's listening is a farmer. What does subsoiling mean?  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:36):**  Daniel Disney So subsoiling basically alleviates compaction.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:38):**  So if you think in your garden, you might go with a with a fork, put your foot in the  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:42):**  fork, put it in the ground, give it a bit of a wiggle, gets a bit of air into the ground  
**[0:23:46-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:46):**  and kickstart it back to life. Jason Vale So it's the same kind of process  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:50):**  but with a tractor and a thing on the back. You know, I wonder because we talk about the  
**[0:23:54-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:23:54):**  soil carbon sponge and the amount of water that can be held and the healthier the soil,  
**[0:24:00-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:00):**  the deeper the root systems, the more water can be held there. And because you know, the  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:05):**  way that you've been managing it, I wonder if obviously it's easier if you're a bird  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:09):**  and you can look down on these things. But whether you get a sense in the summertime,  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:13):**  whether your land is in a better condition, you've got less bare ground in the sward than  
**[0:24:18-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:18):**  some of your neighbours that are managing in different ways.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:20):**  Daniel Disney Well, I actually bought a drone last year  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:23):**  to just to do that very thing. The biggest problem with last year, like I was saying,  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:29):**  massive floods, and then it stopped raining in March and then it didn't start raining  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:33):**  again, I think until about June. So actually, the subsoiling was one of the worst things  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:38):**  we could have done because it then just dried the ground out too much. One thing I'm doing  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:43):**  is this year, my top of my priority list is better grazing management. So looking at rotational  
**[0:24:50-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:50):**  or mob grazing to more intensively graze areas for short times and then move them onto fresh  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:24:59):**  patch to allow that grass then a good month to regrow, you know, to regrow not only on  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:05):**  the surface, but also the roots as well. Up at the new farm, the field sizes haven't changed.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:10):**  I've got a map I think from 1885, the field sizes are all exactly the same. It's a fairly  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:16):**  small, pretty square fields and it just lends itself perfectly to that rotational grazing.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:22):**  Just looking at it slightly differently, one of the other issues from having mild wet winters  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:28):**  that we have is the pests that we have on the vegetables. So normally you need a good  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:32):**  frost to kill off the aphids, the white flies that we have on the brassicas and the lettuce.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:38):**  So bringing more mild winters as we've seen with the recent emergency authorization on  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:44):**  the neonicotinoids on sugar beet, you know, their argument was that not having decent  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:50):**  frost to kill off the aphids. So we need to look at ways, we already do things to encourage  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:25:56):**  beneficial insects on the farm such as planting buckwheat, which attracts hoverflies and lacewings  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:02):**  that feed on aphids. So we need to do more things to encourage those beneficial insects  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:07):**  to keep on top of those pests because otherwise we will have more and more cases of pests  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:12):**  and diseases that are usually killed off by the cold snap that we tend to have in the  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:17):**  winter.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:18):**  Jason Vale â€“ So it's about managing nature better, allowing nature to manage itself better,  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:22):**  having again more diversity within the insect life and the bird life that exists, restoring  
**[0:26:28-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:28):**  that natural balance I suppose that we've been so good at kind of eliminating over the  
**[0:26:32-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:32):**  course of the last 70 years in one way or another. Robert, just, you know, clearly Scotland  
**[0:26:37-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:37):**  gets a bit of rain as well. Are you thinking of looking at mob grazing and that sort of  
**[0:26:41-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:41):**  thing on your farm?  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:42):**  Robert Poulson â€“ Yes, we are. We tend to do it, but not very scientifically I would  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:46):**  suggest. We have big enough herds that we, or big enough mobs that we move around, but  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:50):**  there's not the, there's not the planning to it and we don't maybe take into account  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:26:56):**  residuals enough moving the stock on. So I think it is something we need to look at.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:00):**  Jason Vale â€“ You've both talked about wildlife quite a lot. You're clearly both  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:05):**  very proud of the wildlife that you have on your farm, particularly the bird life. And  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:09):**  Robert, during the COVID lockdowns, you were telling me that you've taken time to sit  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:14):**  down and actually count the birds that you've got at Cowbog. What did you find?  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:18):**  Robert Poulson â€“ Well, like I say, we sat down and I thought I'd seen quite a lot  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:22):**  this year and I think possibly just being at home that little bit more, not attending  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:27):**  agricultural shows for two or three weeks in the summer meant that you saw a full season.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:32):**  On our two farms at 420 acres, we found 85 species of bird on it, not including seagulls,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:40):**  because they confused me a little bit. I can pick one or two out, but not all of them.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:44):**  And that was, it was reassuring that what we were doing was providing enough food sources  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:49):**  and nesting sites for both ground nesting birds and, you know, hedge nesting and tree  
**[0:27:54-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:54):**  nesting birds. Jason Vale â€“ 85 species is a really good,  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:27:58):**  healthy number. And for those, were you tending to see sort of ones and twos or were you seeing,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:03):**  you know, sort of decent sized flocks? Robert Poulson â€“ Well, I guess a lot of  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:06):**  our barn owls that need a bit more of a territory, we weren't seeing those so much. And certainly  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:11):**  last year, whether it was with the dry weather, they didn't have fantastic broods last year  
**[0:28:16-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:16):**  because somebody comes in to ring them on their legs to take account. But our partridge  
**[0:28:23-0:28:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:23):**  that we've seen last year did surprisingly well. Probably the best grey partridge broods  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:27):**  we've seen over winter, whether it's because it's a little bit harder, we've seen tremendous  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:32):**  flocks of linnets and red wings and bramblings. And just a couple of mornings ago, saw about  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:38):**  150 skylarks when I was out moving a fence for some cows in the field. So I think there  
**[0:28:42-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:42):**  are enough numbers of priority species. Jason Vale â€“ Excellent. I think you might  
**[0:28:46-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:46):**  have Ben coming for a visit because Ben, you told me that you've become something of  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:50):**  a twitcher recently and that this is a newfound passion for you. Do you think there've always  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:55):**  been loads of birds on your farm and you've just been unaware or has there been an increase  
**[0:28:59-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:28:59):**  recently? Ben L â€“ I definitely think there's been  
**[0:29:01-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:01):**  an increase. Like you said, it's a relatively recent interest in that I'll be out picking  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:08):**  vegetables all day and you'll just hear some bird like just twittering away and then  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:14):**  you'll get your phone out and you'll start sort of going through the RSPB website, just  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:20):**  looking at, you know, trying to listen to various calls to try and figure out what it  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:24):**  is. We have got a fantastic range of birds and the wild bird mix that we have as part  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:31):**  of the countryside stewardship scheme where we've got sunflowers, millet, quinoa, things  
**[0:29:37-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:37):**  like that, all these seeds. We've got charms of finches, absolutely insane amounts, it's  
**[0:29:44-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:44):**  murmurations that I've never seen. You know, I've always ever seen a couple on a hedge  
**[0:29:48-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:48):**  or something, but to see them in these numbers is absolutely mind-boggling. So that's when  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:29:55):**  you start thinking, oh, so what's that? And then a couple of different types of bird,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:00):**  stonechats and reed buntings, which I'd never heard of before. And yeah, they might have  
**[0:30:06-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:06):**  been there, but maybe it's just that I wasn't looking for them. So again, skylarks, wagtails,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:11):**  yellow and grey wagtails, which are, you know, these, a lot of these birds are the skylarks,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:17):**  the wagtails, meadow pipettes, they feed on invertebrates. So they're also helping us  
**[0:30:22-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:22):**  with our pest problems. They'll be taking slugs, they'll be any little bugs, flea beetle,  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:30):**  they'll be pecking away trying to get hold of those. So it's, yeah, it's fantastic to  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:34):**  see them. And you know that if you've got healthy bird populations, then they're only  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:39):**  there because they've got the feed source there for them. If you've just got farms without  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:45):**  any space for nature, then you can't expect them to thrive.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:48):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:30:53-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:30:53):**  So, you talked about things that you've done on your farm specifically to help different  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:09):**  species.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:10):**  Yeah, we've got plots for ground nesting birds. So the hectare of just bare earth, which is  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:17):**  to encourage lapwings. And lapwings are a bird that we, when I was growing up, we always  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:22):**  used to get, my parents used to take me in the car and we used to go down and they're  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:25):**  fantastic birds and they're cool. And they're slightly curvy wing shape. And we had so many  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:32):**  of them. And then I don't know why, but we just suddenly stopped seeing quite so many.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:37):**  We weren't really intensifying our farming practices, you know, quite the opposite. Like  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:42):**  I said, 20 years ago, we went organic, but we have started to see them come back and  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:47):**  you'll get one come back and then it'll go away and then you might get a couple. And  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:51):**  now we're starting to see groups of them sort of colonising this wild bird nesting area.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:31:58):**  And that's fantastic to see. And as again, I said, the wild bird mix that we plant specifically  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:03):**  for them, but in the veg crops, we do have a lot of fat hen, which is one of the, one  
**[0:32:09-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:09):**  of our biggest weeds we have on the farm, but the seeds from the fat hen, birds absolutely  
**[0:32:14-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:14):**  love it. So if they, if there's space within the crop to encourage birds as well, rather  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:19):**  than just having lots separately to encourage them, then I'm all for that.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:24):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:24):**  It's interesting, isn't it? One of the things that I've heard about the, you know, the decline  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:27):**  in wildlife and bird life on farms is that it's partly just because, you know, machinery  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:31):**  and farmers themselves are becoming more efficient. So the less waste just lying around on the  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:36):**  farm, less grain that gets spilled. And obviously farmers don't want to spill grain unless they  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:41):**  really need to. But what you're doing there is creating those habitats, it's creating  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:46):**  the wildflowers. So that seed is, you know, is having the chance to produce itself. And,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:51):**  you know, it's really good to hear. Robert, we're nearing the end of the programme and  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:32:54):**  I just wanted to come back and touch on something else before we finish. And when we talked  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:00):**  before the programme, you'd said that you wanted to develop your farm, bring the public  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:05):**  onto the farm and make it a sort of distant cousin of River Cottage. You know, what does  
**[0:33:10-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:10):**  that mean? What do you want to do?  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:12):**  We're really keen, I think, like a lot of farmers, and we're really keen on trying  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:16):**  to help share our story and tell people how, or show people how their food is produced  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:22):**  and try and dispel some of the myths. There's an awful lot of noise about at the moment  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:26):**  from well from from everywhere about you shouldn't eat this and you shouldn't eat that. But we'd  
**[0:33:31-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:31):**  rather take people around the farm on tours that we run and show them what we're doing  
**[0:33:37-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:37):**  from an agroecology point of view, but also see how it relates to their to their food.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:41):**  And so you're actively bringing people there, you're inviting groups to come and have experience  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:46):**  days and that sort of thing. What would an experience day entail? What would it feel  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:51):**  like if I came to your farm with my family?  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:54):**  When people arrive, we also welcome them and we give people a little bit of the history  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:33:59):**  of the farm and why we're here and how long we've been here and a little bit about the  
**[0:34:03-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:03):**  area and what we're doing on the farm in terms of the Hereford cattle and the malting  
**[0:34:08-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:08):**  barley production. Then we generally we jump on tracks and trailers and we tour around  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:14):**  and show people the crops, you know, explain the difference between an oak crop and a barley  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:19):**  crop and why we're growing it. And then on to our cattle, which are, you know, they're  
**[0:34:24-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:24):**  very friendly cows, our cows, and they'll wander over to a trailer and they'll like  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:28):**  a head scratch. So explaining to people how they're grazing the grass rather than having  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:33):**  to rely on soil, which they, you know, there's a lot of ruminants get blamed for soil production  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:38):**  and how it relates to a more sustainable product in the UK. And then once we've done that,  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:44):**  we invite people back in for a meal of our products and neighbours products. And as much  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:49):**  as we can, we're doing that from an on-farm basis. So we're just about to put up a small  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:34:54):**  polytunnel to, you know, if we need chilies, we'd rather have them from our own farm  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:00):**  than nipping off to the grocers and getting some from who knows where in the country.  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:04):**  Fantastic. And your wife is helping, I think, with the catering. And so you're doing  
**[0:35:07-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:07):**  catering on the farm as well, and that's becoming part of your business.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:10):**  Oh yeah, I'm absolutely atrocious in the kitchen. I'm much better on the farm. So  
**[0:35:15-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:15):**  Lucy, my wife, she's more or less on the back of COVID and having to stop farm tours  
**[0:35:21-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:21):**  and guests, she's started her own catering company and that ties into our tours and she  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:28):**  knows how to make best use of the seasonal products that we've got here.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:32):**  Fantastic. That's been a really interesting sort of whistle-stop tour through mixed production.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:37):**  We've been talking about cereals, vegetables and beef all mixed in there, as well as the  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:43):**  issues around, you know, diversification. So bringing people onto the farm, having experience  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:47):**  days, the joy for farmers of seeing the wildlife and the bird life doing their thing on the  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mixed-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eq4cs8#t=0:35:53):**  farm. So that's fantastic. That's all we've got time for. I'd like to thank my guests,

### Farm Gate  (Thu, 06 Oct 2022 15:26:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. This episode is the recording of a recent webinar, Regen Dairy's  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:11):**  Round the World Tour. Hello, thanks for joining us. I'm Finnlow  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:15):**  Costain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell, and welcome to our Round the World Tour of  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:20):**  regenerative dairy. I'm thrilled to be hosting this opportunity to circumnavigate the globe  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:25):**  with four very different regenerative dairy farmers, all of whom are quite exceptional  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:29):**  in their own way. We'll be taking a whistle-stop tour of regenerative  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:33):**  dairy in the UK, Germany, the USA and New Zealand, and following the conversation, which  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:38):**  will probably take around 40 minutes, there'll be a Q&A, so please do put questions in the  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:43):**  chat box, and feel free to introduce yourselves and make comments as we go, as I can see you  
**[0:00:48-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:48):**  already are. So this Round the World Tour is part of the  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:51):**  Regen Dairy project, which was set up by FAI Farms and Farmwell in collaboration with Arla  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:00:57):**  Foods, Barry Callebaut, Ben & Jerry's, Unilever and Woolworths South Africa. Through this  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:02):**  project, we aim to define what regenerative dairy looks like from the bottom up and throughout  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:07):**  dairy supply chains, and to engage dairy farmers and food businesses around a practical vision  
**[0:01:12-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:12):**  for a productive and profitable global dairy sector that also restores its relationship  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:17):**  with nature. So, to our guests, Blake Alexander is a fourth-generation  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:23):**  dairy farmer from Alexander Family Farm near Crescent City, California, USA. Richard Park  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:29):**  is from Sizer Farm near Kendall in the UK, which has probably been farmed since the Vikings  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:34):**  colonised Britain, probably 1100 years ago, I think is how far back the records go. Mark  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:40):**  Anderson is a fifth-generation farmer from South Otago, New Zealand, and Annabel Girard  
**[0:01:45-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:45):**  is a first-generation dairy farmer from Lower Saxony in Germany. So, welcome everybody.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:51):**  Thanks for being here. Could we start perhaps with just a one-minute introduction to your  
**[0:01:55-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:01:55):**  farms please, farm size, herd numbers, breed, yield, climate, and what products you sell.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:01):**  And Blake, could you perhaps start us off? Yeah, coming from extreme Northern California,  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:06):**  kind of the most Western point in the continental United States, and very cool season climate  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:13):**  here where we've been grazing cattle for, well, four generations in my family. We actually  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:20):**  manage about 9,000 acres and about 9,000 head of cattle. So, half of those are mature, organic  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:27):**  dairy cows, and we milk on five different farms. We own all the farms. It's my wife,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:33):**  Stephanie and I, and our five grown children are mostly part of the business. Our oldest  
**[0:02:38-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:38):**  three are married and all work full-time for us. And we launched our own brand about five  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:43):**  years ago and sell fluid milk around the United States. And we've also make some yogurt and  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:49):**  as well as kefir coming. We've been regenerative for about two years and organic for more than  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:55):**  20. Fantastic. Richard, could you tell us about your farm?  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:02:59):**  My farm is in the Northwest of England. We've been here for just over 40 years. My parents  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:05):**  came here 40 years ago. The farm is leased or rented from the National Trust, which is  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:11):**  a UK charity that own a lot of historic buildings and land. We milk 170 crossbred cows. We are  
**[0:03:19-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:19):**  on about 380 acres, 155 hectares, about 45 meters, 144 feet above sea level. We get about  
**[0:03:30-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:30):**  55 inches of rain, about 1400 millimeters. So, we're in an extremely good area for growing  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:39):**  grass and we utilize that with the cows. We've been on and off organic for the last 15 years.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:46):**  And I guess the regenerative journey probably the last four years.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:49):**  Lovely. And just to put that wetness in context, Cumbria is probably one of the wettest parts  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:54):**  of the UK. Would that be fair? That would be correct, yes.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:03:58):**  Thank you. Annabelle, could you tell us a bit about your farm?  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:00):**  Yes. Hello everybody. So, our farm is located in the North of Germany. It's called Huftangseel.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:07):**  And we farm about 300 acres. 200 of them are grassland and 100 acres are arable land. And  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:15):**  I'm not alone. We are a group of six people. We are farming together. And 10 years ago,  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:20):**  we leased this farm from a nonprofit organization. So, our goal was to produce regional and sustainable  
**[0:04:28-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:28):**  organic food. So, we developed the farm with dairy, with our own creamery, with big beef  
**[0:04:35-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:35):**  and pork production, with eggs and a lot of varieties of vegetables. So, within this context,  
**[0:04:43-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:43):**  we have a herd of 30 milking cows that contains of 25 milking cows and five nurses. We keep  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:50):**  all the cows at the farm and all together we have around 100 heads of cattle. So, we  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:04:57):**  raise and finish them by grass. Because from the beginning, we were searching for genetics  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:02):**  that fit to our circumstances. Our herd is really mixed. So, we have Holstein Frisian  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:09):**  and old German Frisian. We have brown Swiss and old brown cattle. And we have mixtures  
**[0:05:16-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:16):**  out of this. Our yield is around 5000 liters milk per year per cow. And the climate is  
**[0:05:23-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:23):**  yes, it's continental. So, we have hot summers, cold winters, and we can have periods of drought  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:33):**  and less rainfall in the spring, in the summer, in the autumn and in the winter. So, we have  
**[0:05:39-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:39):**  650 millimeters of rainfall, but it's really unsecure when it will come or if it will come.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:46):**  Yes, and the average temperature is around eight degrees.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:49):**  And Mark, just last but not least, could you tell us about your farm in New Zealand?  
**[0:05:53-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:05:53):**  Thanks,  
**[0:06:09-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:09):**  Mark.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:10):**  So, we've been holding to what it is now a larger monoculture milking 620 cows today.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:16):**  For the last five years, we've bred away from the traditional New Zealand Frisian towards  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:22):**  Normandy and Fleckley. And the focus there has been on the dual purpose animals with  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:28):**  superior foraging capabilities. And that will be a low input animal with a good fit for  
**[0:06:34-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:34):**  our mob grazing and our once a day milking system. With dry land, so we receive around  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:41):**  700 to 800 mils of rain annually, and we're very greedy. So, we like to capture all that  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:48):**  rain in our soil and not give it away. Yeah, focusing on soil health is a big one for us.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:06:54):**  Our pasture yields are somewhere around that 11 tonnes annually. And we supply milk to  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:00):**  our local co-op with independent beekeepers on farm. Yeah, we're just looking to diversify  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:06):**  more and scale up on silver pasture and agroforestry, we see huge potential.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:13):**  Fantastic. That's really helpful. Thanks so much, everybody. That's a really good starting  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:17):**  point. Now, Richard, you've been, as you said, you know, you've been organic or thereabouts  
**[0:07:22-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:22):**  for 20 odd years. And you told me that as an organic farmer, originally, you looked  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:26):**  at regenerative farming in a bit of a snobby way. And I wonder, what do you mean by that?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:32):**  What was a snobby way? And what changed for you?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:35):**  Yeah, I think it's because organic, you know, there's a procedure to follow, there's a conversion  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:39):**  period, there's a set of standards that you have to meet, you're inspected quite rigorously  
**[0:07:45-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:45):**  every year. So, you know, this regenerative term came along with quite a lot of actually  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:50):**  crossover with organic. You sort of thought, well, you know, is this going to undercut  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:07:56):**  organic? I'm quite an inquiry mind. I, you know, I'm always up for doing research. And  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:01):**  once I got to looking into it, I realised that it actually complemented what we were  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:06):**  doing very well and actually allowed me to take the sort of next step, if you like, from  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:12):**  where I was with my organic farming. So, it perhaps started off as a fear of competition,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:17):**  that there were sort of these young upstarts who were coming in with their new way of doing  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:21):**  things. And organic was perfectly good. And there was perhaps a fear that it was going  
**[0:08:26-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:26):**  to undercut the market to an extent?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:27):**  Possibly, and that's the thing with organic, it allows me to access a higher value market  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:33):**  and those people that are buying those products, you know, they're guaranteed the standards  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:38):**  and the production system. Regenerative though, I feel, allows people to come in at all sorts  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:44):**  of different entry levels. And then as they get more confident, they can then sort of  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:48):**  move up through, whether they become, we convert to organic, it all depends on, you know, the  
**[0:08:53-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:53):**  market that they might be aiming for.  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:55):**  And then, so it was quite a gradual change for you. It wasn't like you sort of woke up  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:08:58):**  one morning having had a revelation in a dream and thought, no, I'm going to be regenerative  
**[0:09:03-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:03):**  now. It was something more gradual.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:05):**  It was definitely more gradual. It was really, there was a bit of a light bulb moment. I  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:09):**  did the holistic management course. That was really the start of the journey.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:14):**  Well, that's a good segue really, because Annabelle, you've also done the holistic management  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:19):**  course, but I wonder from your perspective, what was it that made you want to become regenerative  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:24):**  in the first place? And why was it so important for you to make the transition?  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:29):**  Yes. The reason is I was in a crisis. My opinion was that the status quo was no option anymore  
**[0:09:37-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:37):**  for us. So the story begins in 2013, when we leased the farm. From the beginning, we  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:44):**  were struggling with the agricultural circumstances. So we really have poor growing conditions.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:52):**  And especially the water cycle is really difficult to improve. And we have sandy soils, it's  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:09:59):**  with low organic matter. If seven days, no rain and sun, the grass will stop to grow.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:05):**  So yes, it's no wonder that all the farmers around us, they started already 50 years ago  
**[0:10:12-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:12):**  to build irrigation systems. And we also built an irrigation system, and we tried to really  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:20):**  to improve circular farming. But we had a low stocking rate, and we still have a low  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:25):**  stocking rate. And the fertilizer, the manure is always the limiting factor for us. And  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:31):**  we started to make a strong marketing, we started the community supported agriculture  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:38):**  that enables a high stability, we created the own processing, the own creamery. And  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:45):**  so we have a high diversity of products. And yes, we did, our basic assumption was when  
**[0:10:52-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:10:52):**  we work hard, we will fix it, we will win, just work hard and everything will go in the  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:00):**  right direction. And we thought organic is king, it's the solution. And so we used all  
**[0:11:06-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:06):**  our tools that we knew to improve the growing situation. And then in 2018, we were in a  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:14):**  real drought that was really dramatic for us. So for the vegetables, we had irrigation  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:20):**  for the arable crops, we had to take decisions what to maintain and what to give up. And  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:26):**  for the grasslands, there was no technical solution. We feel like we were victims of  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:31):**  the drought. And it was psychological, really dramatic for us. That was the time where I  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:38):**  had a different perspective, because I was out of the daily work. I had born our second  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:44):**  child and with a baby I was walking around, I saw everything and I asked myself, what  
**[0:11:50-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:50):**  are we doing here? I don't see any perspective for the next 30 years here in this area with  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:11:57):**  this farm. So this was a kick in my ass. And I became open minded and I took an account  
**[0:12:05-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:05):**  that I could be wrong.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:07):**  Fantastic. That's a really, really, really good description. We'll go into some of that  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:11):**  in a bit more detail. And a little bit later, and I just wanted to pick up on that community  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:16):**  supported agriculture thing, because it's probably a term that other people weren't  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:20):**  necessarily understand. So what it essentially means, and correct me if I'm wrong, is that  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:25):**  you have a fixed group of customers that you're supplying for and there are fixed prices.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:29):**  And I think you said to me before that basically everything you grow has already effectively  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:34):**  been sold because of that relatively new piece of legislation in Germany.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:38):**  Yes, that's true. Yes.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:40):**  Thank you. That's really interesting. And Blake, you were the first dairy farmer to  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:44):**  actually be certified regenerative in the United States. I wonder how important that  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:49):**  certification has been for you in terms of selling your product and making your case,  
**[0:12:54-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:54):**  demonstrating your regenerative nature to customers.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:12:57):**  Yeah, I think I should back up to, you know, really 30 years ago when when Stephanie and  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:03):**  I bought our main ranch, which was an expansion away from our families, we really got into  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:10):**  building organic matter and soil and paying attention. And we've always been grazers for  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:15):**  generations and so, so we were building organic matter and then along came a market for organic  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:20):**  milk and so 25 years ago, we decided to, you know, venture into that because we wanted  
**[0:13:26-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:26):**  to create a future for our kids that was probably more profitable and kind of in a sense we  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:32):**  were chasing that that market. And then, much like Richard was saying, and then along came  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:38):**  this new word regenerative here a few years ago, and we asked our daughter to participate  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:43):**  as a pilot program with a couple of the groups that were certifying regenerative farms nationwide  
**[0:13:49-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:49):**  and so at that point we then two years ago we're launching a couple of fluid items nationally  
**[0:13:56-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:13:56):**  and Whole Foods, the large retailer here, Natural Products asked us for a certification  
**[0:14:03-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:03):**  they said hey you say you're regenerative but you know, do you have anything to prove  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:06):**  it and so we went to the Savory Group Land to Market and asked for their verification  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:12):**  program and they gave us, you know, a document and at the same time we were working with  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:16):**  the Regenerative Organic Alliance and they also gave us a document so we became the very,  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:21):**  the very first certified and verified farm in the United States by both of those groups,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:27):**  and it really wasn't, you know, a goal that we had set out to do it just kind of happened  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:32):**  and the timing worked in our favor, and I believe that it has opened up a lot of doors  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:36):**  for us, doors literally to this panel today and we've done a lot of interviews, a lot  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:43):**  of podcasts.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:44):**  Certainly retailers and consumers are really resonating with the word regenerative and  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:51):**  you know I would like to just give you my take on what I believe the word means and  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:56):**  how it kind of resonates in our world.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:14:59):**  You know first we're Christians and you know so we kind of have always paid attention to  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:05):**  some biblical principles, and I believe that this term regenerative is just absolutely  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:09):**  farming in harmony with God and our nature and you know our creator if you will, and  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:16):**  paying attention to the system that we've been, it's been designed for us and so as  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:21):**  a farmer now I just simply pay attention to that and I'm fully aware of the biology and  
**[0:15:27-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:27):**  the soil and my job is to do no harm and to feed them and help them do better so that,  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:35):**  you know, our plants and our animals eventually do better and our yields go up and so that's  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:40):**  what it means to me right now and also you know we're sequestering carbon at a pretty  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:45):**  fast rate, it's part of the solution to global warming and climate change and all the concerns  
**[0:15:51-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:51):**  that a lot of people have and so it's been a really nice word or concept to help summarize  
**[0:15:59-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:15:59):**  that entire story.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:00):**  I love the idea that effectively over the course of the 30 years you were already regenerative  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:05):**  and that partly through that kind of biblical spirituality you were already starting to  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:09):**  pay attention to the biology perhaps in a way that some other people around you weren't  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:14):**  but the name regenerative in society has sort of caught up with you as you've gone along.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:19):**  Mark, like many your transition to regenerative dairy and like Annabelle grew out of crisis  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:26):**  and yours was a financial crisis and I wonder if you could talk to us about why it was that  
**[0:16:30-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:30):**  you began to make the transition.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:32):**  Thanks, I guess I was financial but also there were many other tension events that came together.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:40):**  We seem to have this mindset drilled into us at young ages that we must get bigger or  
**[0:16:46-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:46):**  get out and that kind of mechanistic mentality values kind of positions and stuff more than  
**[0:16:54-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:16:54):**  experience and kind of wisdom or knowledge and it's almost an inbuilt story that we have  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:02):**  told ourselves.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:03):**  We got caught up in that story.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:06):**  We picked about 950 milking cows twice a day but we were faced with low milk payouts, consecutive  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:13):**  dry seasons, we had a couple of quite bad droughts and I also had a health scare and  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:19):**  autoimmune disease and at that time we were employing contracting milkers and the focus  
**[0:17:25-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:25):**  really with that system in New Zealand is production at all costs and chasing this production  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:33):**  was putting a large strain on the land and the people and the animals.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:39):**  Yeah the farm had become more of a machine than a living system I think.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:43):**  Yeah we just started to ask more questions, we read more, we met new people, we researched  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:49):**  principles of permaculture and regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:17:53):**  When I was ill I realised that the farm was like a mirror image of the farmer itself.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:00):**  You know the farm was losing soil, we were losing nitrate, animal health was poor and  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:06):**  chemical use had increased so I really took a look in the mirror and asked the hard questions.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:14):**  Once we gained that knowledge and we wrapped some support people around us that kind of  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:19):**  gave us the confidence to move forward in a new system and I guess that's when we started  
**[0:18:24-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:24):**  to rapidly remove winter cropping and tillage and move to just bale grazing and tall pasture  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:32):**  for wintering.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:33):**  We moved very fast to take synthetic nitrogen out of the system and today we make compost  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:40):**  and then we implemented mop grazing into the once a day milking system so we made many  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:45):**  changes.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:46):**  Now we also removed in-shed grain feeding and we really redefined what success looks  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:53):**  like with a kind of 100 to 200 year vision.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:18:57):**  Annabelle I wonder if I could come back to you.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:01):**  When you decided to transition I remember that you struggled to convince your partner  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:07):**  that this was a good idea and I wonder if you could tell us what he said and what happened  
**[0:19:13-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:13):**  next.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:14):**  Anika Leinbach So yes, we needed really a shift in the mindset  
**[0:19:20-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:20):**  and this shift for me was like a revolution in my head and my revolution took part one  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:27):**  or two years before his revolution in his head.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:31):**  So I began with these thoughts but then I did the basic course, holistic management  
**[0:19:41-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:41):**  and holistic plant grazing and in spring 2020 I told my husband that I want to do holistic  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:50):**  plant grazing with two of our herds and he did not see a sense in it and he was really  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:57):**  critical.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:19:58):**  His critical points were who was going to do the work so there will be a lot of fencing,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:03):**  we don't have the water infrastructure and how can I mow or mulch, how can I control  
**[0:20:10-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:10):**  the weeds and everything.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:13):**  So we will have much more work and for what.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:16):**  So he said you can do that but you will do it alone and then I did it alone and it took  
**[0:20:23-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:23):**  about four months and then we were both convinced because we saw the effects maybe not for an  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:32):**  outstanding person but for us.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:34):**  We know the land for years and we know our struggle and our problems with the grassland  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:43):**  and so we both saw the effect and then yes, we started to continue our way together and  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:50):**  now it's a strong part of our relationship and it's a shift from struggling and fighting  
**[0:20:56-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:20:56):**  against a lot of things to use the power and the processes of nature to create stability  
**[0:21:04-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:04):**  and resilience.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:05):**  For example, at first we thought the milk yield has to be 6500 litres per cow so that  
**[0:21:14-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:14):**  was our goal and now it's just the question how can we best integrate our cows, our cattle  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:25):**  in the ecosystem processes, how can we best integrate them and then yes, we will harvest  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:31):**  milk and we have to see how much milk is it.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:35):**  Blake, I'd like to think about scale for a moment and the scale of your business is  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:39):**  significantly larger than many of the other regenerative dairy businesses that we found.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:44):**  What do you think it is that's enabled you to succeed at scale?  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:47):**  I think the question of whether we've succeeded at scale is still yet to be answered so we're  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:52):**  still working on that.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:53):**  It's a struggle.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:21:55):**  I think it's important that I just point out I grew up on a 150 acre farm with 150  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:01):**  cows here in Ferndale and Hovoldt County and I've just been very, very aggressive and  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:08):**  I've kind of dragged my wife along that path and eventually our kids have helped a lot.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:14):**  We just grew and grew because we were the very first organic dairy farm in our region  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:20):**  and there was a lot of need for that 20 years ago and so we just had a milk market that  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:27):**  was asking for more supply.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:29):**  Then things went on a down cycle and neighbours started to go out and so their land became  
**[0:22:33-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:33):**  available and that's when we stepped in because we could always use more grass and that's  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:41):**  kind of how we grew.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:43):**  To be at the scale that we're at, it really comes naturally.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:48):**  We also get a lot of rain here, 45 inches here in Hovoldt County but about 80 to 90  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:54):**  or even 100 inches of rainfall in Delmar County where the majority of our cows are.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:22:59):**  And so it's extremely wet, much like I think the climates and environments that New Zealand  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:07):**  and maybe Richard's in.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:08):**  And so it's been a lot of fun because as we get better and better at being regenerative,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:15):**  yields go up and that's the message that I tend to give to my conventional neighbours  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:20):**  or conventional farmers across the United States is that I believe that everybody should  
**[0:23:24-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:24):**  look at the principles involved here and pay attention to the soil biology and the roots  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:30):**  and the plants and the benefit that happens when you keep basically your land covered  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:37):**  with plants and certainly green plants are better than brown plants.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:41):**  Everything is better than bare soil and so that's the message.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:45):**  Mark, thinking about the bigger picture, why is a regenerative transformation so important  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:51):**  do you think for the global dairy sector and also how do you measure regeneration on your  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:57):**  farm?  
**[0:23:58-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:23:58):**  That first one's a pretty big question.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:01):**  I think it's very important in many ways.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:05):**  One would be decoupling of the externalised costs or damage caused by the current model.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:12):**  Here we're trying to internalise those costs now and as a large industry I think we need  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:17):**  to reduce our dependence on energy along with most fertiliser inputs, some of which are  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:24):**  already past peak supply.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:26):**  These inputs are non-renewable.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:29):**  That means our current trajectory is not sustainable and sustainability is a byproduct of regeneration  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:38):**  so it's in our best interest to move in this direction I feel.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:44):**  I think we'll need more people on the land, for example we now need more people in our  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:49):**  system with scaling our own fertility programmes, so with our compost.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:24:54):**  So it's a lot of talk about less production and less people needed but actually it's the  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:01):**  opposite once you start layering more pre-reality into your system, whether that's fruit and  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:07):**  nuts, vertical grazing, silver pasture etc.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:12):**  So yeah, the systems have gone so far mono I think it'll be like a large restoration  
**[0:25:19-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:19):**  phase leading into regeneration and yeah that'll be not so much land use change but layering  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:27):**  diversity back into our system to make it more resilient.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:32):**  I believe it's also really important for local food security, you know if food security is  
**[0:25:38-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:38):**  linked to soil security so we need to nurture our soil, look after our soil and that's the  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:45):**  base from there we build from there.  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:48):**  And I think once you are starting to move in the most regenerative practitioners are  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:53):**  thinking this way, they're thinking how can we layer complexity back into the landscape,  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:25:58):**  how can we increase biodiversity and make our system more resilient.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:04):**  So you're seeing the regenerative change and I think also you've got university students  
**[0:26:08-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:08):**  coming onto the farm, you know monitoring various different things.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:11):**  I think you were having some super high worm counts when we spoke to you for one of the  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:15):**  podcasts and people can listen to a bit more about your system in the podcasts on the Farmgate  
**[0:26:21-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:21):**  channel.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:22):**  Richard how has your approach to farming changed since you decided to adopt those regenerative  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:28):**  principles?  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:29):**  Yeah as I said I did the holistic management course and then there's the three principles  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:34):**  there, there's the decision making process, there's the social, the environmental and  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:39):**  the economic are the three things that you need to consider with every decision.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:43):**  But on the land I was, I guess I got in a bit of a rut, you know how can I implement  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:48):**  those things that I'd learned, you know the holistic plant grazing, all those really good  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:54):**  things.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:26:55):**  I was able to read the land, I was able to see that I had problems, I had bare soil,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:00):**  I had you know water not getting away quickly enough, I had weeds coming, we had the docking  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:06):**  you know is a big weed for us.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:10):**  It was how I could move on and really the regenerative principles that I've adopted  
**[0:27:15-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:15):**  in a relatively short space of time, you know literally a couple of years, we're moving  
**[0:27:20-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:20):**  forward so we're moving more towards the taller grass grazing which is a challenge for me  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:27):**  anyway I think for dairy farmers because you just worry about you're going to lose that  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:32):**  quality that you need.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:33):**  I have much more diversity in the pastures than I had before and that's either coming  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:39):**  back or I'm introducing that when I'm doing any reseeding.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:43):**  I'm also introducing that into the silage as well, we house the cows during the winter  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:47):**  so we're feeding silage and with more diversity so that's benefiting things.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:27:54):**  The slurry is one that all the composting and stuff, I mean at the moment we've a lot  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:00):**  of work to do there but there's different people doing different things and I think  
**[0:28:05-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:05):**  that's all part of this great journey that there are some people that are further ahead  
**[0:28:10-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:10):**  than you are and I'm perhaps further ahead than others and we're all learning our feature.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:15):**  That knowledge sharing element of regenerative seems to be really exciting and I think it's  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:20):**  partly when organic was first developed we didn't have the social media and these sorts  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:24):**  of opportunities that we do now whereas regenerative kind of has a head start in that way.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:30):**  Blake, you've been doing this for a long time and I wonder when you're talking about why  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:35):**  you do what you do to conventional farmers, what do you say to convince them that regenerative  
**[0:28:40-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:40):**  dairy is also good business dairy?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:43):**  I believe it totally increases yields and we certainly have diminishing returns on fertilisers  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:50):**  and so folks that are growing basically corn and soybeans across the United States, those  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:28:56):**  are the two primary cash crops, every year they've got to use more fertiliser to grow  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:01):**  the same yield and that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to get the same yield  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:04):**  that they got last year.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:06):**  To me that's a perfect example of how some of those commercial fertilisers are harming  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:12):**  the biology and so it might be two steps forward, one step back, they need to pay attention  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:18):**  to that and so again I tell the farmers to pay attention to some of the principles, they  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:23):**  don't have to switch churches and religions all at the same time, I'm not asking them  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:27):**  to go certified organic or anything like that, they can certainly pay attention to these  
**[0:29:32-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:32):**  regenerative principles and kind of honour that soil system if you will and I believe  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:39):**  make their farm more profitable and it's a long term effect.  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:44):**  There was a question here on the side that what have we noticed in our soils and I guess  
**[0:29:49-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:49):**  I'd like to say that 30 years ago we started paying attention to building organic matter  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:29:54):**  and so on our primary farm at home we've gone from 2 or 3% organic matter in the soil to  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:00):**  8 to 15 now and it's crazy, that's just a tremendous growth and so I think of it as  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:06):**  in our farmers literally getting one inch taller every decade or something and we are  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:12):**  doing everything we can to haul in fish waste from the coast, we bring in a lot of wood  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:18):**  chips from the lumber mills and then of course our manures and we are composting as much  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:23):**  as we can and trying to spread that out on about 25% of our farm every year and just  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:29):**  rotate that around, nothing scientific, we just drive by and if it looks like it made  
**[0:30:35-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:35):**  the low end of the list we run with that, it's really a simple program.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:41):**  The other thing I just wanted to mention was that you know, I guess for Annabella, our  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:47):**  favorite breed of cows, we use all crossbreed cows but we're using the barbarian Fleck V  
**[0:30:53-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:30:53):**  which is a German breed and dual purpose, I heard Mark mention that and we absolutely  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:00):**  are in love with those cows and so the majority of our animals are all Fleck V cross and we  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:06):**  also focus on the A2 protein and so everything we sell is A2 milk.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:11):**  Jason Vale, PhD Blake, even without knowing that you've just  
**[0:31:13-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:13):**  performed the perfect segue because you're talking about your breed and I wanted to ask  
**[0:31:17-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:17):**  Richard next about genetics because it's something that you've worked hard on Richard over the  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:21):**  last 20 years and I wonder how important this has been in terms of your success across that  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:25):**  time and particularly for your regenerative approach now.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:28):**  Richard Clark, PhD Yeah, I would start crossbreeding probably  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:31):**  20 odd years ago. My philosophy then and it still is now is that the cow changes to suit  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:38):**  the farm and not the other way around. I was on a treadmill before of changing the farming  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:43):**  system to suit the cow and now it's definitely the other way around and it's brought a lot  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:48):**  of benefits. We block calve in the autumn, well we're three quarters of the way through  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:52):**  calving now and it's just you know, they calve easily, they're healthy, we have very, very  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:31:57):**  little mastitis, we haven't used any antibiotics for two years, we have very good fertility.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:02):**  The buildings that we have are certainly aren't very modern but the cows for the housepear  
**[0:32:08-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:08):**  are happy in those and perform well and my feeding system is very simple and I just select  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:16):**  the best, the cows that are performing the best are the ones that I breed from. For each  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:20):**  generation I'm seeing an improvement. I've sort of pretty much stuck with the Scandinavian  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:26):**  Red, the Holstein and the Montbelliard and I put a little bit of Jersey in there now  
**[0:32:31-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:31):**  and again but those are the breeds that suit me and I have tried you know some of those  
**[0:32:35-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:35):**  other breeds but I've just found that those breeds suit this farm the best.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:39):**  Jason Vale We've just got another couple of questions  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:41):**  before we go into that Q&A and Annabelle, while regenerative agriculture is becoming  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:46):**  quite well known really for farmers in Britain, it's you know it's in the media quite a lot  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:51):**  now as well as in the USA and in New Zealand. It's a much newer concept in Germany and I  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:32:56):**  wonder why that is and how difficult it's been for you to find information to support  
**[0:33:01-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:01):**  your own transition. Annabelle Bremen Yes, it's really an interesting  
**[0:33:05-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:05):**  question and concerning regenerative agriculture we're a kind of developing country so and  
**[0:33:14-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:14):**  especially for region dairy, there are no farmers at all, as I know. So, what is the  
**[0:33:22-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:22):**  reason, what are the reasons, I don't know really. One could be the language, because  
**[0:33:28-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:28):**  a lot of farmers, they don't speak that good English. For me the regenerative agriculture  
**[0:33:36-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:36):**  seems really practical driven or a bottom up process. So, the farmers have to think  
**[0:33:43-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:43):**  how to change their practice and so they have, they need access to the information or to,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:51):**  yeah, they have to get inspiration about different ways of farming. So maybe the language is  
**[0:33:57-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:33:57):**  one problem, and maybe our agricultural system, because we are a country of wealth, yes, we  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:05):**  face the planetary boundaries, but we are addicted by fossil fuels, we have, yes, high  
**[0:34:11-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:11):**  technical standards, high energy input, and our climate usually is quite moderate. Actually,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:19):**  it's changing. And the European policies, they try to protect farmers, and maybe they  
**[0:34:25-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:25):**  don't, they protect the system that is not regenerative. And I think as more crisis,  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:33):**  we will have is more regenerative agriculture will start, will grow. But at the moment,  
**[0:34:40-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:40):**  there's no authority that recommends regenerative agriculture. And yes, it's also it's a long  
**[0:34:46-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:46):**  term perspective. And at the moment, we are farming short term farming.  
**[0:34:51-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:51):**  Mark, just finally, before we go to the audience, I want to talk about the big issue. Again,  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:34:57):**  you're getting lots of big issues of greenwash, the idea of companies making grander claims  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:02):**  than they're able to deliver. And I wonder how significant you think the threat of greenwash  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:08):**  is for individual farmers and for the dairy sector more broadly?  
**[0:35:12-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:12):**  Yeah, good question. I think there's the gates are open, really. I think that with the  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:19):**  nothing there's potential for the greenwash or to mislead or present false information  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:25):**  to our potential eaters. Yeah, I guess at the farm level, we are in control. So we're  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:31):**  in control of that story until it leaves the gate. If you want to sell direct to the eater,  
**[0:35:37-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:37):**  you better be true to your word and transparent because eventually you'll be found out or  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:43):**  exposed, I guess. And that goes for middle industry too. So the threat of greenwash is  
**[0:35:49-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:35:49):**  large and real. And the backlash from a more conscious eater is very large, I would presume.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:01):**  And we're in this agriculture, we're in this for many generations, and we're in it for  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:07):**  the long game. So we don't want to do something in our nest that we wouldn't go and sit in.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:12):**  I guess on our farm, we can now map the five or six years of third party data via what  
**[0:36:19-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:19):**  was originally integrity soils and now Michael Cashmore. And we can showcase that, we can  
**[0:36:26-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:26):**  showcase our regenerativity and how that's progressing over time, how our counts have  
**[0:36:33-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:33):**  been increasing, how our soil organic matter, our rooting depth, our water infiltration.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:39):**  So we can we can map that and present that. I mean, I do I value the outcomes based monitoring.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:46):**  I think for a sector, we need animals back on pasture, we need them back on land, mimicking  
**[0:36:51-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:51):**  nature. I love the idea of living barns, which are trees, more trees in the landscape, less  
**[0:36:58-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:36:58):**  concrete, improving our soil to the point where we can hold our animals on the soil  
**[0:37:04-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:04):**  for more of the year. Yeah, I guess it's a real challenge, especially for higher import  
**[0:37:10-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:10):**  of dairy. And I see the greenwash sitting in pretty fast. I guess regeneration is built  
**[0:37:17-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:17):**  on indigenous wisdom and, you know, these methods of farming that are traditional. So  
**[0:37:24-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:24):**  it's, we need to take that with the latest science and move forward from there, I guess.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:29):**  Thanks so much, Mark. We're going to leave it there in terms of my questions and turn  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:33):**  to the audience just for a moment. So thanks so much, everyone. I think it's been a fascinating  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:38):**  conversation so far. And I just want to mention before we go into the questions about our  
**[0:37:43-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:43):**  Regen Dairy Farmers Survey. And I'd like to ask you if you have any contact with dairy  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:49):**  farmers at all, if you're a dairy farmer yourself, to please share it with your contacts and  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:54):**  fill it in. It's a really important part of our research in the Regen Dairy Project. We  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:37:57):**  need responses from as many dairy farmers as possible, including from conventional farmers  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:02):**  who are perhaps more sceptical about regenerative dairy and regen agriculture more broadly,  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:07):**  getting an understanding of all farmer perspectives we think is really important. And so this  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:12):**  is a fantastic opportunity really through the survey to inform both the project and  
**[0:38:16-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:16):**  also the future direction of Regen Dairy, certainly in the minds of the companies that  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:22):**  we're working with on this. If you go to the regendairy.org website, then you'll find  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:26):**  it, the survey at the top right there. So to the questions, this is sort of building  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:31):**  on a question that came in earlier, Blake, around where you were talking about an inch  
**[0:38:35-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:35):**  of soil organic matter a decade. You were talking about the amount of sequestration  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:40):**  that you're getting in your soil. And I wonder how long do you think that sequestration will  
**[0:38:44-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:44):**  carry on for? Do you think it'll carry on indefinitely or is it sort of over a finite  
**[0:38:49-0:38:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:49):**  period?  
**[0:38:50-0:38:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:50):**  As far as I understand at this point, it will carry on. And organic matter converts down  
**[0:38:56-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:38:56):**  to humus and humates and it becomes part of the soil stability. And so I don't know if  
**[0:39:04-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:04):**  there's a limiting factor. I don't believe there is at all. We just keep adding on and  
**[0:39:07-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:07):**  on and it gets taller and bigger and better. And so I see it as a long, long term solution.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:15):**  I think you've already answered this question as well, Blake. It's another one for you.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:19):**  Is regenerative agriculture a protected legal term in the US is the question. And then there's  
**[0:39:24-0:39:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:24):**  a sort of supplementary there about how many certification schemes for regenerative agriculture  
**[0:39:29-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:29):**  exist and are any of them dairy specific?  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:32):**  Yeah, nothing dairy specific for Regen at this point. And, you know, there's the two  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:37):**  that we participate in. They were the first two here. There's a couple new ones now. You  
**[0:39:42-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:42):**  know, I think that greenwashing is absolutely real. I don't know exactly whether that really  
**[0:39:47-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:47):**  hated or to just feel bad about it, because at least it gets people talking about it and  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:52):**  the concepts eventually work out. But, you know, I think it's important for us farmers  
**[0:39:57-0:40:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:39:57):**  to always remind everybody this does need to start at the ground up. And I've talked  
**[0:40:01-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:01):**  to large retailers and you know, world well, Danone, let's put it that way and told them  
**[0:40:07-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:07):**  that, you know, I don't want to speak to their farmers unless it's coming from farmer to  
**[0:40:12-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:12):**  farmer, I don't want to educate Danone to go out and preach from the top down. This  
**[0:40:16-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:16):**  is absolutely a bottom up and ground up movement and it needs to maintain that so that we have  
**[0:40:22-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:22):**  integrity. You know, again, I think that this is the solution to our global crisis that  
**[0:40:29-0:40:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:29):**  we tend to all have in developing countries and emerging countries. And so, you know,  
**[0:40:36-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:36):**  I think it's here to stay. And yeah, we can just keep sequestering more and more carbon.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:41):**  There's a more specific question here and, you know, open to everybody, anybody that  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:47):**  wants to take it on. And it's, I guess, looking at the conflict between how we make environmental  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:53):**  progress at the same time as how do we protect farm animal health and welfare. And so this  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:40:57):**  is from Ryan. It says, I'm curious of everyone's worming policies. Do you all vaccinate for  
**[0:41:02-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:02):**  lungworm, for example, to minimise the use of ivermectins, which are the most harmful  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:07):**  to soil biology? Is this something that any of you have particularly thought about and  
**[0:41:12-0:41:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:12):**  would like to have a quick comment on? I'm looking perhaps at Richard in the first instance  
**[0:41:16-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:16):**  to have a go at that one. Yeah, I can answer that. Yeah. So, we don't  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:21):**  use any ivermectins. They're not allowed in organic systems anyway. We don't use any  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:27):**  wormers during the grazing season. And we do regular faecal egg counts to monitor those.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:33):**  We do vaccinate for lungworm, and then we'll monitor fluke as well. But we found that with  
**[0:41:38-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:38):**  the rotational grazing, particularly the slightly longer rotations that we've now adopted with  
**[0:41:45-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:45):**  the taller grass grazing, you know, that sort of 30 plus days, that's certainly breaking  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:49):**  that cycle, especially with the, you know, the younger cattle. Just weighed in the other  
**[0:41:54-0:42:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:41:54):**  day, actually. So, it's very timely, you know, we were targeting 320 kilos at 12 months,  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:00):**  and we were average 355. So, you know, really pleased with that result.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:04):**  Fantastic. This is a question from Lottie, and it says, and maybe, Annabelle, this is  
**[0:42:09-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:09):**  a good one for you, because when we've spoken, you said, you know, you've come from the conventional  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:12):**  world into the world that you are now. And that perhaps gives you a bit of an insight  
**[0:42:17-0:42:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:17):**  into how, you know, how conventional farmers continue to think. And so, the question is,  
**[0:42:22-0:42:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:22):**  what would you say is the biggest barrier for a conventional farmer looking to move  
**[0:42:27-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:27):**  towards regenerative practices?  
**[0:42:29-0:42:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:29):**  I didn't come from the conventional farming. I came from organic farming. But maybe it's  
**[0:42:35-0:42:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:35):**  the same, somehow. I think a lot of farmers think never change a running system. So, if  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:45):**  you have something that works, then you will continue. So, really, for me, it was necessary  
**[0:42:52-0:43:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:42:52):**  to be in a crisis, to be, to accept that I, maybe that I'm wrong. Yeah, it's a process  
**[0:43:00-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:00):**  that you have to do by yourself. Nobody can just force you to do that. It's something  
**[0:43:06-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:06):**  you have to do by your own.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:08):**  Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And a question perhaps that, Mark, you could have a go at, because  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:14):**  I think you've touched on some of these elements. And the question is, to what extent do the  
**[0:43:19-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:19):**  panelists see regenerative agriculture practices going beyond the benefits of carbon sequestration  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:25):**  by adding mitigation potential of nature-based solutions in the water cycle? So, I guess  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:29):**  the question is around, you know, that sort of climate change adaptation and mitigation,  
**[0:43:34-0:43:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:34):**  but that biodiversity increase and the managing of the soil carbon sponge as well.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:38):**  Good question. I guess here, we're now seeing that there's a lot of talk about carbon  
**[0:43:44-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:44):**  tunnel vision and people focusing in just on carbon. So, we think increasing carbon  
**[0:43:52-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:43:52):**  at all trophic levels, like I'm talking soil, pasture, trees, animals, that birds, these  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:00):**  are all carbon-based elements. So, just focusing in on one is not good enough, I don't think.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:07):**  It's a system within systems. And that's how we can really tap into increasing biodiversity  
**[0:44:16-0:44:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:16):**  and really pulling back on some of these inputs or crutches that we've held onto for a long  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:22):**  time. Increased biodiversity will increase our resilience and help us get off some of  
**[0:44:29-0:44:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:29):**  these external inputs that are having some kind of pretty negative effects, to be honest.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:35):**  There's a question for all of you and maybe just, you know, jump in if you want to have  
**[0:44:39-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:39):**  a go. The question is, for Mal, could companies who farmers sell their milk to not be instrumental  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:46):**  to help share and spread regenerative agriculture knowledge? And I wonder how you think they  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:51):**  might do that? I can start on that. I mentioned Whole Foods.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:44:57):**  They're a large retailer here with over 500 stores in the United States, and they're certainly  
**[0:45:01-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:01):**  the leading retailer of natural foods. And they have absolutely embraced what we do as  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:08):**  regenerative farmers. And they're kind of putting their money where their mouth is in  
**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:13):**  that regard. And I think that other companies will follow along that line. I'd also like  
**[0:45:19-0:45:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:19):**  to maybe just touch back. I was sitting here thinking to one of the other questions about,  
**[0:45:24-0:45:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:24):**  you know, this regenerative and how long can we, you know, keep it up. I just want to remind  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:28):**  everybody that all of our ancestors going back for thousands of years have been regenerative  
**[0:45:33-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:33):**  farmers. And we get all wrapped up in this weird conventional versus organic versus now  
**[0:45:39-0:45:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:39):**  regenerative. And while I'm just saying regenerative is back to full circle, what our great, great  
**[0:45:44-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:44):**  grandfathers were doing in another era, and before synthetic fertilizers and other things,  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:52):**  you know, we just have a whole lot more awareness of the biology and the understanding and the  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:45:57):**  relationship and the symbiotic relationship between roots and and critters in the soil.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:02):**  So that's the answer to how long term this is and how sustainable it is.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:07):**  That's all we have time for. So our round the world tour has come to an end. And I'd  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:11):**  like to thank our panelists who I think have just been fantastic. It's a shame on Zoom,  
**[0:46:16-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:16):**  you don't get to give a round of applause. But you know, I think they deserve an enormous  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:20):**  round of applause for the work they've done this evening. So I'd like to thank them, Annabel  
**[0:46:24-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:24):**  Girard from Germany, Mark Anderson from New Zealand, Richard Park from the UK, and Blake  
**[0:46:30-0:46:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:30):**  Alexander from the USA. And thank you too for joining us for your comments and questions.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:36):**  And can I please remind you again about the Regen Dairy survey, which is for all dairy  
**[0:46:41-0:46:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:41):**  farmers, not just Regen Dairy farmers on our website, regendairy.org. Thanks so much. I've  
**[0:46:47-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Dairy-round-the-world-tour-edited-e1osord#t=0:46:47):**  been Phil O'Kastain. Bye for now.

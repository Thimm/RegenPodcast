### Farm Gate  (Sun, 23 Feb 2020 16:55:53)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:08):**  The European Chicken Commitment aims to lift standards of broiler welfare.  
**[0:00:13-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:13):**  Signatories to the commitment must make the shift from standard intensive indoor production  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:17):**  systems for rearing meat chickens to more humane, extensive indoor systems.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:23):**  And they have to do this by the first of January 2026.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:27):**  That may sound like it's a long way in the future, but delivering on the commitment will  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:31):**  require fundamental changes in signatories production systems and business models.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:36):**  As you might imagine, the commitment has attracted widespread attention from broiler producers,  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:41):**  and excitingly, several major brands have already signed up, including Nestle, Unilever,  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:46):**  M&S, Waitrose and KFC, who I'm going to speak to in a moment.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:51):**  The European Chicken Commitment was developed by animal welfare organisations from across  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:55):**  the continent, including Deutsche Tierschutzbund, Wirpfotten, otherwise known as Four Paws,  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:01):**  Eurogroup for Animals, RSPCA and Compassion in World Farming.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:06):**  The commitment focuses on six principal asks.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:09):**  Two of these centre on legal and commitment compliance, the others address stocking density,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:14):**  breed change, environmental enrichment and slaughter.  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:18):**  In this programme I'll be looking at how these changes will improve the lives and deaths  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:22):**  of chickens reared for meat, and considering some of the practical implications of delivering  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:27):**  the required standards within the established timeframe.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:30):**  That's coming later.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:33):**  First of all, I wanted to get a sense of the challenge the commitment represents for food  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:37):**  businesses.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:38):**  Jenny Packwood is the Director of Responsibility and Reputation for KFC UK and Ireland.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:44):**  I started by asking her whether chicken welfare was really in the minds of KFC's customers.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:49):**  It is, and I think increasingly it is.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:54):**  Actually all of our customers, and we see this across multiple touch points, we see  
**[0:01:59-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:59):**  it across social media, we see it going into our customer care, but the question of welfare  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:06):**  is something that matters to, I think particularly to the UK consumer.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:11):**  But I think increasingly the world is changing as well, in that people care more than ever  
**[0:02:17-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:17):**  about their food and the ethics of how it's been raised.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:20):**  I think maybe there's a bit less trust.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:22):**  There is a lot of anxiety around food and where it comes from and how it's raised.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:28):**  And I think quite often the public are ready to believe the worst.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:33):**  And there are obviously lots of campaigns and things that you can see online which would  
**[0:02:37-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:37):**  make you think the worst.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:39):**  So as a business that, you know, our core product is chicken, for us it was sort of,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:45):**  well, we have to invest in this.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:47):**  We're actually really proud of the standards we've got today, which are probably higher  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:52):**  than a lot of people realise.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:53):**  I'm interested in the scope of this commitment because obviously KFC is a global brand.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:00):**  This is a commitment that you're making in terms of the UK and Ireland supply chain.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:05):**  Could you talk about why the decision has been taken to implement it here, whether that  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:11):**  is possibly the sort of a testbed where the commitment may go global in the future.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:18):**  And when we're talking about the UK supply chain, is that just from chickens that have  
**[0:03:24-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:24):**  been reared in the UK?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:25):**  No.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:26):**  So just to give you some context, actually, the markets within KFC that have signed up  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:33):**  to the commitment are the UK and Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:39):**  Just to clarify, the way KFC operates is we're a very decentralised business.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:45):**  So the UK and Ireland have complete autonomy.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:49):**  We have autonomy to run our business in the way that we see fit.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:54):**  We are not directed by the global business as to the kind of choices that we make and  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:00):**  commitments we make.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:01):**  We are very autonomous.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:02):**  And I suspect the reason why we made that choice ahead of some other markets is that  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:10):**  we're just further ahead on that journey.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:13):**  In the UK, we've had a welfare programme since 2004.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:17):**  We're one of the very few number of restaurants, I believe, that actually have always done  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:24):**  or since 2004, welfare specific audits across its entire supply chain.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:30):**  And those standards have changed on an annual basis pretty much, haven't they?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:33):**  I think you're in the 20th incarnation at the moment of those auditable items.  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:40):**  So what we did, I think, you know, the last two, two and a half years, this is something  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:44):**  that we've really, really focused and put more energy on.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:49):**  And that involved us really kind of getting on top of, you know, getting our ducks in  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:54):**  a row.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:55):**  We established a welfare policy.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:57):**  So we'd had a programme, but we actually hadn't had an unarticulated policy, something in  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:03):**  black and white that said, this is what this is what, you know, what we're expecting of  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:07):**  our suppliers.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:08):**  So we created that with input from Compassion in World Farming and World Animal Protection,  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:14):**  who were really helpful in kind of challenging us and helping us to kind of define what that  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:19):**  should look like.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:20):**  And then I think another big step forward was we invested in, I suppose, a software  
**[0:05:28-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:28):**  tool, which enables us to collate and track data from all of our suppliers.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:34):**  So 30 suppliers across three continents and basically track and measure welfare metrics.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:42):**  These specifically are measuring outcomes, aren't they, rather than just input.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:46):**  So it's not about providing the opportunity for good welfare.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:49):**  It's about actually measuring that that welfare has occurred.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:52):**  Exactly.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:53):**  And yeah, so I think that just also gave us a bit more confidence that actually now we've  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:57):**  got a tool that we can actually track and measure improvement.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:02):**  What it covers is all the chicken that we buy in to the UK business.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:08):**  So a good chunk of that obviously does come from the UK and Ireland.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:12):**  So all of the chicken which goes into our bucket, so all of our classic chicken on the  
**[0:06:17-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:17):**  bone original recipe is UK sauce, chicken, Red Tractor standard.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:23):**  And then we buy to the same welfare standard from other parts of the world.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:29):**  So some comes from Europe, some comes from Thailand, some small amounts come from Brazil.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:35):**  Signing the European Chicken Commitment is a big deal for KFC UK and Ireland.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:40):**  It's a leap of faith and the company has been frank in saying that there isn't a clear roadmap  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:45):**  for how to deliver.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:46):**  Part of the challenge is that KFC is part of an integrated supply chain.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:51):**  Though big, they only represent 4% of the UK chicken market and they don't have dedicated  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:56):**  producers or chicken houses.  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:58):**  Look at it this way.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:59):**  If KFC only buys 10% of a farmer's birds from a given house, then that farmer is less likely  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:05):**  to want to take their direction.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:07):**  A farmer ideally needs their customers to have the same system requirements so that  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:11):**  as producers they're not stuck between two mutually incompatible systems.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:15):**  KFC has taken an important leadership position and now the company is working with other  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:20):**  major buyers, particularly the retailers that make up the lion's share of the UK chicken  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:25):**  market to help ensure that these really big supermarkets can also step up and sign the  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:31):**  commitment.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:32):**  However, regardless of the nuts and bolts, KFC is confident that they can deliver on  
**[0:07:37-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:37):**  the commitment.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:38):**  This is partly because they're already measuring welfare outcomes and have 20 years experience  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:43):**  of monitoring the success of management changes and interventions to improve welfare across  
**[0:07:48-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:48):**  their supply chain.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:50):**  But the question remains, why has KFC signed up to the commitment now?  
**[0:07:54-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:54):**  So I think why now is people care more than ever about their food, the ethics of how it  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:02):**  was raised, what they're putting inside their body.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:05):**  You know, I think there is something very visceral about, you know, how we feel about  
**[0:08:10-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:10):**  our food because ultimately we're putting it inside ourselves.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:13):**  So we want to feel safe and secure about that.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:16):**  And we also, I think people are increasingly aware of the impact that food production,  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:22):**  food systems, global agriculture, all of this, the impact it has on the world and the environment.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:29):**  Jenny Packwood from KFC.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:32):**  That's given us some idea of the motivations companies might have for signing the European  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:36):**  Chicken Commitment.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:37):**  So now let's delve into more of the detail.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:40):**  The commitment is science-led.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:42):**  The six requirements are chosen because they'll all make a demonstrable difference to the lives  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:46):**  of meat chickens, meaning improvements to both broiler welfare and to bird health.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:52):**  However, it's welfare that's at the heart of the commitment and the ability to demonstrate  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:56):**  natural behaviours is the keystone of welfare science.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:00):**  The first element of the commitment that I want to look at is environmental enrichment,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:04):**  which includes the use of natural light, perching and pecking substrates.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:08):**  FAI Farms works with major food brands and advises them on the delivery of food sustainability,  
**[0:09:14-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:14):**  including farm animal welfare.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:16):**  Annie Rayner is their research coordinator.  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:19):**  She's also working on a PhD in broiler welfare.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:21):**  I started by asking Annie about the role natural behaviour plays in measuring good chicken  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:28):**  welfare.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:29):**  So obviously there's a range of behaviours, some of which are good for welfare and some  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:34):**  perhaps would be considered not so good for welfare.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:37):**  So anti-predatory responses, so running away from a predator perhaps wouldn't be so good  
**[0:09:42-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:42):**  for the welfare of an animal.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:44):**  But behaviours that are positively reinforcing or what we kind of define as positive behaviours,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:50):**  so ones that they're really motivated to do, bring enjoyment or are beneficial for their  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:55):**  health.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:56):**  So for broilers, if you look towards things like dust bathing, it's really important to  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:01):**  provide friable litter.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:03):**  They're really motivated to dust bathe.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:05):**  We know that in laying hens in a cage system, they'll still look to dust bathe, even though  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:09):**  there's no substrate there available to them.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:13):**  And what's the point of dust bathing?  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:15):**  So with dust bathing, essentially they're realigning all of their feathers.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:18):**  In the wild, it would have been a way of controlling parasites.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:22):**  So introducing dust into their feathers and then shaking them out again, hopefully taking  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:28):**  the parasites with them.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:30):**  Feathers are also barbed and it just realigns them, just smooths them out again, increasing  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:35):**  their kind of water resistance and general kind of health of their feathers.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:39):**  So broilers, even though we're obviously keeping them in an indoor environment with not so  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:43):**  many parasites or no parasites, they're still really motivated to do this dust bathing  
**[0:10:48-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:48):**  behaviour.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:49):**  Ani Rayner.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:51):**  Kelly Watson is a programme manager for FAI Farms and has particular expertise in delivering  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:56):**  improvements in broiler systems.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:59):**  I asked her to try and explain environmental enrichment from a chicken's perspective in  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:04):**  terms of what do the birds actually want?  
**[0:11:08-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:08):**  What the birds want is stimulation and some things do that better than others.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:11):**  But one thing I think people miss in terms of enrichment for broilers is providing a  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:15):**  really great friable litter or bedding helps them exhibit those natural behaviours that  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:21):**  we see, which would be scratching and dust bathing, as well as the kind of need to peck.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:26):**  You know, that would be a thing that they did when they were in the jungle, their ancestors,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:30):**  you know, looking for food.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:31):**  So quite often in broiler houses, you'll see CDs or cable ties or some people may even  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:37):**  be, you know, using brassicas or anything hung up just for the birds to peck.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:42):**  And ideally you want them to have a reward for doing it.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:45):**  Kelly Watson.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:46):**  Let's go back to Ani Rayner to consider the role of natural light.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:50):**  For chickens, vision is their dominant sense.  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:53):**  They really rely on a natural or a light environment.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:57):**  They've got a different spectral sensitivity to humans.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:00):**  So they can see into the UV spectrum, which is provided by natural light, although can  
**[0:12:06-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:06):**  be filtered through a lot of windows and such.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:08):**  But either way, they need a light environment.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:11):**  And actually what we've tended to do historically is darken down the environment so that they  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:17):**  stay quieter so that they aren't as active and so that all of that energy is put into  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:22):**  building up meat, obviously, for consumption.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:26):**  So providing a natural environment in the UK, we tend to do it down the sides of the  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:31):**  sheds, which does provide quite a nice variation across the shed.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:35):**  So you see that the birds use the different light environments quite differently.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:40):**  So in the middle, perhaps where it's a bit darker, you tend to see quite a lot of resting  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:44):**  birds, whereas along the sides where we've got the windows, you tend to see much more  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:50):**  active behaviours, so things like sparring or playing or running around, you see them  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:56):**  scratching at the litter and foraging or searching for food.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:01):**  Stocking density is one of the most economically challenging elements of the European chicken  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:06):**  commitment, which requires a shift from 38 kilograms per metre squared to 30 kilograms  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:11):**  per metre squared.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:13):**  I asked Annie to set out why stocking density is so important to broiler welfare.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:18):**  And then I asked Kelly to explain how stocking density is measured.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:22):**  The higher stocking density is obviously if you have more birds in a shed, you're more  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:26):**  likely as a chicken, if you're walking from one place to another, you're more likely to  
**[0:13:31-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:31):**  hit another bird if there are more birds there essentially.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:34):**  So by reducing stocking density, you're reducing crowding, you're increasing the available  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:39):**  space to perform quite a lot of these behaviours or the more active behaviours.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:44):**  Having a higher stocking density as well, it puts quite a lot of pressure on the environment.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:48):**  It makes it maybe slightly harder to manage in terms of the litter.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:53):**  So if you've got more birds on the litter, essentially you've got more for faeces, it's  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:56):**  harder to perhaps keep that dry or to ensure that that is of a good quality.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:02):**  So litter obviously has a big impact on the behaviours they perform, but also impacts  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:08):**  upon hop burn and pododermatitis, which are painful conditions really for chickens.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:14):**  So the 38 kilos is measured at a single point.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:18):**  So when we're talking about stocking density, we're talking about the maximum stocking density  
**[0:14:22-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:22):**  allowed.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:23):**  That will be the birds when they're small will grow and fill a space and then at some  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:27):**  point they will hit 38 kilos a metre squared, at which case the house needs to be cleared  
**[0:14:33-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:33):**  or thinned to either allow birds to grow on or for the cycle to finish.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:38):**  Kelly just mentioned thinning.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:40):**  Now the commitment says that thinning, if it's practised, should be limited to one thin  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:44):**  per flock.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:46):**  But what is thinning?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:48):**  We thin birds in commercial systems, really driven by the economics.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:52):**  So what we're doing is we're growing birds to the maximum stocking density permitted.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:56):**  So let's say that's 38 kilos.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:58):**  So we grow the birds in the house, we get them to 38 kilos and then we take a proportion  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:03):**  out, which is called a thin, that might be 25 to 30% of the house gets removed.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:09):**  Those birds will be say at 1.85 kilos live weight.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:14):**  They get taken to the factory and then they will get used as any other chicken would.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:19):**  So they will get used to produce chicken portions or whole chickens or wherever they need to  
**[0:15:24-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:24):**  go.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:25):**  And then the remainder of the chickens are left in the house to grow on again.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:28):**  So basically what the thin does is maximise the return in terms of kilos of meat that  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:32):**  can be produced from the house.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:35):**  Now when we see a reduction in stocking density from say 38 to 30, what we're seeing is the  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:40):**  number of birds that you can put in the house to start with is less.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:45):**  So for a farmer, this means potentially he's got less kilos of meat he can produce because  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:51):**  he's got less birds to produce them from.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:53):**  It also means that the inputs required to run that house, such as the heating and the  
**[0:15:59-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:59):**  lighting and all the things that go around that, those inputs go up per bird, price per  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:05):**  bird, because you've got less birds to spread the cost over.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:09):**  So this is the impact that stocking density has in terms of the economics for the farmer  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:14):**  and for the processor.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:15):**  That cost of production goes up because you're having less birds for every metre squared  
**[0:16:22-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:22):**  that you have available to grow them.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:24):**  The other big economic challenge is the requirement to move from a fast growing breed to a more  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:29):**  slow growing bird that meets the criteria of the RSPCA, Broiler Breed Welfare Assessment  
**[0:16:35-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:35):**  Protocol.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:36):**  I asked Annie Rayner why breed is so important.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:39):**  So with the slower growing birds, we know they have fewer health issues.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:44):**  They're putting less energy perhaps into growth and perhaps just taking a little bit  
**[0:16:49-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:49):**  more time for that immune system and immune function to develop and support them.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:55):**  So we have benefits in terms of general kind of pathologies and there's suggested benefits  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:01):**  in terms of reduced antibiotic use, probably from that reduction in pathologies.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:07):**  In terms of walking ability as well, we tend to see fewer birds that need to be culled  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:12):**  because of having bad legs.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:15):**  We can see that they can walk much better.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:17):**  They have a much more fluid motion of walking and generally less lameness.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:23):**  And then I guess because of that, you get that knock on effect of a more mobile bird  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:28):**  that's able to perform more of these positive behaviours that we've been talking about.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:33):**  So they're more able to get up onto perches, they're more able to run around and perhaps  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:38):**  act more like a chicken.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:40):**  So breed makes an enormous difference in terms of broiler welfare.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:44):**  But what about the practicalities of making the change?  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:48):**  Let's go back to Kelly Watson.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:49):**  So the big one really in terms of breed is availability of that breeding stock.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:55):**  So availability of the broiler breeders that are required to lay the eggs for the broiler  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:01):**  birds.  
**[0:18:02-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:02):**  So that goes right back to the hatcheries and the parent stock and grandparent stock.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:08):**  So if you imagine the chicken supply chain as a pipeline, so it's constantly, it never  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:14):**  stops and to make sure that we always have chicken meat coming through.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:18):**  So bringing those breeds in requires a lot of planning and it requires changes and that  
**[0:18:25-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:25):**  availability issue is a big one.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:27):**  Because if we're suddenly asking a breed company, for example, Hubbard, to suddenly shift up  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:34):**  a gear into the amount of breeding birds it has to produce more parent stock to lay the  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:40):**  broilers, that requires them to do so.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:43):**  And that change is not overnight.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:45):**  It takes time to get those birds on the ground to lay the eggs and go through the system.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:49):**  So it is a big ask, this breed one.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:51):**  And of course, everyone is very wary because that investment is big as well.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:56):**  So when you start making changes to your system and you're talking about big changes, that  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:00):**  investment requires people to be confident that it's not a flash in the pan.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:06):**  So it's about if you want, for example, someone is asking their chicken supplier to change  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:13):**  their breed, that chicken supplier will want reassurance that they're going to fulfil this  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:18):**  requirement because it's a big change and it's a big investment to make that shift.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:23):**  So the broiler ask is for these changes to be in place by 1st of January 2026.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:30):**  In terms of breed change, at what point before 2026 does that decision finally need to have  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:38):**  been made in order that that parent stock will have worked its way through the system?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:44):**  So this is a bit of a difficult one because there's so many moving parts involved.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:48):**  But it will depend on how many chickens are required.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:51):**  And it will depend, you know, it will depend on whether people already have stock down.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:56):**  But let's just let's just say, for example, you speak to your chicken supplier and you  
**[0:20:00-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:00):**  ask, you say we want to change a breed.  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:02):**  So I think probably you'd be looking in a good scenario of at least 18 months to two  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:08):**  years to get the first two years.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:10):**  That's remarkable.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:11):**  The first chickens through the system.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:13):**  So it's important to realise that it won't just be a case of going from the 1st of January  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:18):**  2026, we're all suddenly going to change from a standard breed on the 31st of December into  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:23):**  a slow growing breed on the 1st of January because it doesn't work like that.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:28):**  There's a system and the numbers have to work through the system.  
**[0:20:32-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:32):**  So you know, you're placing if you like in sequence.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:35):**  So as for example, one standard breed of flock goes out producing standard birds that would  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:40):**  be replaced with a slow growing breed of flock.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:44):**  But that means that actually your transition may take two years for you to start.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:49):**  But then depending on how many birds you need a week, you know, there'll be a period of  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:53):**  time when that can be fulfilled just because of the way the supply chain works.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:57):**  So I mean, you are talking and that's in, you know, providing the breeding stock is  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:01):**  available and everything else.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:02):**  So you know, minimum two years really for 18 months to two years just to get to start  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:07):**  the slower growing breed coming through the system.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:10):**  So really, when we think about the broiler ask that there were there were two kind of  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:15):**  big fundamental asks here.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:17):**  One is that a company, you know, makes that first commitment and economic commitment to  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:22):**  change their business model so that so that it works and it fits with this transition  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:27):**  to slower growing breeds in particular to to lower stocking densities.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:32):**  But then there's there's just simply the practical challenge of implementing that change and  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:37):**  and frankly, to get it delivered by 2026 companies that have signed up to this are about to sign  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:42):**  up to it, they kind of need to get on with it.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:44):**  Yeah, they do.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:45):**  And it needs to be planned.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:47):**  So there's no there's no way around this, it needs to be planned and then and there  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:50):**  needs to be a proper, you know, timeline or roadmap put in place if people are going to  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:56):**  hit that hit that deadline and 2026 is not is not far away.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:00):**  The last big element of the European Chicken Commitment aims to improve welfare at slaughter.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:06):**  This requires a shift to controlled atmospheric stunning or to effective electrical stunning  
**[0:22:11-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:11):**  without live shackling and inversion.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:14):**  With the controlled atmospheric stunning or CAS stunning, and there's fewer kind of components  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:19):**  can perhaps go wrong and fewer components that also negatively impact on the welfare  
**[0:22:23-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:23):**  of the birds.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:24):**  So with the CAS stunning, you're not taking those birds or handling those birds between  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:30):**  the crates that they arrive on the lorry at the slaughter plant and then them going through  
**[0:22:35-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:35):**  to processing so they remain in the crates.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:37):**  So there's a removal of a handling stage and then also in electric stunning when when they  
**[0:22:41-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:41):**  are being handled, they're being inverted.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:44):**  So they're fully live, fully conscious, and they are being turned upside down in this  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:49):**  strange environment, obviously quite loud, quite aversive really to the birds.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:53):**  We also know that birds struggle to breathe when they're upside down because of this lack  
**[0:22:58-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:58):**  of diaphragm.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:59):**  There's a lot of pressures on their lungs, which is stressful.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:02):**  We know that that inversion is a stressful phase and it is a required phase within the  
**[0:23:08-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:08):**  kind of current electric systems.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:11):**  You remove the possibility of pre-stun shocks.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:14):**  So essentially, if you have birds that are going through or just about to reach into  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:19):**  the water bath, there's a possibility of water kind of flicking up and then getting slight  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:25):**  electric shocks, but not enough to fully make them unconscious.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:31):**  You also know that we get quite a variation in bird size, which can then impact upon the  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:37):**  current that's going through the birds, which then means you can get some inadequate stunning.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:42):**  Whereas in the CAS system, they're all put in together.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:45):**  They're monitored to make sure that the stunning is effective.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:49):**  But there's less of these kind of less moving parts, I guess.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:53):**  You've got less kind of impacts upon welfare through kind of handling the birds through  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:59):**  these pre-stun shocks.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:01):**  And obviously that can then have impacts not on the welfare, but also on the carcass quality.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:06):**  So fewer breaks and bruises perhaps you see with the CAS system, which are obviously painful  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:11):**  as well for the birds if they happen before they're stunned.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:13):**  And what about the gas mix?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:14):**  Yeah, so we know that carbon dioxide isn't the, it's an aversive gas.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:20):**  It causes irritation to the eyes and the throat.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:24):**  We know that there are better, more inert gases.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:26):**  So argon or nitrogen, I think is better for the welfare of the birds, but it's more expensive.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:34):**  It's not a byproduct that the carbon dioxide is currently of the fertiliser industry.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:38):**  So it's quite relatively readily available, though last year we had some struggles with  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:43):**  accessing it.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:44):**  Many reiner.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:45):**  One of the criticisms of the European Chicken Commitment is that it's focused on a single  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:49):**  issue, welfare.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:51):**  In the round, sustainability requires a holistic or whole farm approach.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:56):**  And there's a danger that when you promote one aspect of sustainability, you can have  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:00):**  a negative impact on others.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:02):**  Put simply here, if birds live longer, then they require more feed and other inputs, potentially  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:07):**  increasing the environmental impacts of that farm system.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:11):**  I asked Kelly Watson to consider the overall impacts of the commitment.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:15):**  This is an interesting one because obviously the European Chicken Commitment is kind of  
**[0:25:20-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:20):**  a single issue.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:21):**  So it's looking at welfare, but it's not looking at potentially at sustainability in the whole.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:26):**  So we know, as you've just pointed out, that those birds are alive longer.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:30):**  And we know that, for example, roughly 20% of a chicken's diet will be soya and around  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:36):**  60% will be wheat.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:37):**  So we know that there's a certain amount of grain that goes into those into those birds  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:41):**  and we know that they'll eat more because they're alive longer.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:44):**  So this, I guess for me, there's a piece practically about are we assuming, is the industry assuming  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:51):**  that everything carries on as normal and we still have the 10 day turnaround and we still  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:56):**  use the same feed ingredients?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:58):**  Or is there now a time to think about, well, if I'm investing in new housing, should I  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:03):**  be looking at houses that perhaps I can shorten the time they're empty between crops so that  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:08):**  I can get more birds through potentially without damaging my biosecurity or my cleaning system,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:13):**  cleaning those houses and making sure they're suitable?  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:16):**  And can I look at alternative feed ingredients?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:19):**  So there's lots of talk about insect protein.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:23):**  There's talk about could you use more, say, grass in broiler diets.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:27):**  There's lots of thoughts about can we try and offset some of the impact of this by looking  
**[0:26:34-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:34):**  at things differently and investing perhaps in new technology, new innovation and looking  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:39):**  at, for example, different feed ingredients.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:42):**  So good welfare and good environmental outcomes can be coupled in this instance?  
**[0:26:46-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:46):**  They can.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:47):**  I don't I think it's it's difficult if everything stays the same.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:52):**  So what needs to change?  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:53):**  So then I mean, there's obviously there's a need to look at, you know, how do we how  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:58):**  do we manage these birds?  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:59):**  How do we how do we look at the system and think about how we can minimise the impact?  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:05):**  But the you know, the biggest one, I guess, is about do we need to produce the same number  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:09):**  of birds or do we try and get margin and look to produce less?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:13):**  So it's a very controversial issue.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:15):**  And the chicken producers in the country will not be happy with me saying that.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:18):**  Neither will the chicken processors.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:20):**  But, you know, that's one of the things we've got to think about.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:22):**  You've indicated, you know, should we be eating as much or should we should we be looking  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:27):**  for everybody to make the profit in the business that they need to, but potentially produce  
**[0:27:31-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:31):**  in less?  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:32):**  That's a really controversial one, but it's one that we've got to think about.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:35):**  Kelly Watson there explaining how the European chicken commitment could lead to better sustainability  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:41):**  overall, providing food businesses look at the commitment as an opportunity to further  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:45):**  develop their overall business models.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:48):**  I went back to Jenny Packwood to ask how KFC plans to address these issues.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:53):**  One of the difficult things with the commitment is that no one quite knows how it's going  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:59):**  to play out.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:00):**  There are cost implications of moving to a slower growing breed.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:03):**  That is the change of breed is the single biggest challenge.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:08):**  Do you think that you'll be able to bring your customers with you, even if your menus  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:12):**  and your prices change in order to meet the commitment?  
**[0:28:16-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:16):**  That's a really good question.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:17):**  And I think ultimately, yes, that's part of our job is that and our challenge is that  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:23):**  we will have to take the customer on the journey with us.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:26):**  And I suspect that's going to take some time.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:29):**  I think we're certainly we're not going to do anything drastic overnight.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:33):**  It has to be a journey.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:36):**  But there is a reality that if chicken becomes meat in general becomes more expensive, all  
**[0:28:42-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:42):**  businesses are going to have to revisit their models and how they price things and so on  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:49):**  with the consumer.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:50):**  But who knows how many years that will take.  
**[0:28:54-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:54):**  But I think I do think it is critical that we keep communicating and keep engaging the  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:00):**  customer as much as we can about why welfare is important in order to take them on that  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:06):**  journey.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:07):**  Because you can't just suddenly turn around to someone and say, oh, well, now your chicken  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:11):**  might be more expensive.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:12):**  You know, there is only so much you can pass on.  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:15):**  I think there is so much excitement and pride in our business that we have signed up and  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:21):**  that we were the first in our sector to sign up to this.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:25):**  It's been really galvanizing for us across the entire business to say this is what we're  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:31):**  lining up behind.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:32):**  You know, as I said, we've got chicken in our name.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:35):**  It's the right thing for us to be on the front foot and pushing for improvements in welfare  
**[0:29:41-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:41):**  for all chickens.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:42):**  And yeah, that's something we feel really passionate about.

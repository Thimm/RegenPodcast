**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  The European Chicken Commitment aims to lift standards of broiler welfare.  Signatories to the commitment must make the shift from standard intensive indoor production  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:17):**  systems for rearing meat chickens to more humane, extensive indoor systems.  And they have to do this by the first of January 2026.  That may sound like it's a long way in the future, but delivering on the commitment will  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:31):**  require fundamental changes in signatories production systems and business models.  As you might imagine, the commitment has attracted widespread attention from broiler producers,  and excitingly, several major brands have already signed up, including Nestle, Unilever,  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:00:46):**  M&S, Waitrose and KFC, who I'm going to speak to in a moment.  The European Chicken Commitment was developed by animal welfare organisations from across  the continent, including Deutsche Tierschutzbund, Wirpfotten, otherwise known as Four Paws,  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:01):**  Eurogroup for Animals, RSPCA and Compassion in World Farming.  The commitment focuses on six principal asks.  Two of these centre on legal and commitment compliance, the others address stocking density,  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:14):**  breed change, environmental enrichment and slaughter.  In this programme I'll be looking at how these changes will improve the lives and deaths  of chickens reared for meat, and considering some of the practical implications of delivering  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:27):**  the required standards within the established timeframe.  That's coming later.  First of all, I wanted to get a sense of the challenge the commitment represents for food  
**[0:01:37-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:37):**  businesses.  Jenny Packwood is the Director of Responsibility and Reputation for KFC UK and Ireland.  I started by asking her whether chicken welfare was really in the minds of KFC's customers.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:01:49):**  It is, and I think increasingly it is.  Actually all of our customers, and we see this across multiple touch points, we see  it across social media, we see it going into our customer care, but the question of welfare  
**[0:02:06-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:06):**  is something that matters to, I think particularly to the UK consumer.  But I think increasingly the world is changing as well, in that people care more than ever  about their food and the ethics of how it's been raised.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:20):**  I think maybe there's a bit less trust.  There is a lot of anxiety around food and where it comes from and how it's raised.  And I think quite often the public are ready to believe the worst.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:33):**  And there are obviously lots of campaigns and things that you can see online which would  make you think the worst.  So as a business that, you know, our core product is chicken, for us it was sort of,  
**[0:02:45-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:45):**  well, we have to invest in this.  We're actually really proud of the standards we've got today, which are probably higher  than a lot of people realise.  
**[0:02:53-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:02:53):**  I'm interested in the scope of this commitment because obviously KFC is a global brand.  This is a commitment that you're making in terms of the UK and Ireland supply chain.  Could you talk about why the decision has been taken to implement it here, whether that  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:11):**  is possibly the sort of a testbed where the commitment may go global in the future.  And when we're talking about the UK supply chain, is that just from chickens that have  been reared in the UK?  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:25):**  No.  So just to give you some context, actually, the markets within KFC that have signed up  to the commitment are the UK and Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:39):**  Just to clarify, the way KFC operates is we're a very decentralised business.  So the UK and Ireland have complete autonomy.  We have autonomy to run our business in the way that we see fit.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:03:54):**  We are not directed by the global business as to the kind of choices that we make and  commitments we make.  We are very autonomous.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:02):**  And I suspect the reason why we made that choice ahead of some other markets is that  we're just further ahead on that journey.  In the UK, we've had a welfare programme since 2004.  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:17):**  We're one of the very few number of restaurants, I believe, that actually have always done  or since 2004, welfare specific audits across its entire supply chain.  And those standards have changed on an annual basis pretty much, haven't they?  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:33):**  I think you're in the 20th incarnation at the moment of those auditable items.  Yeah.  So what we did, I think, you know, the last two, two and a half years, this is something  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:44):**  that we've really, really focused and put more energy on.  And that involved us really kind of getting on top of, you know, getting our ducks in  a row.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:04:55):**  We established a welfare policy.  So we'd had a programme, but we actually hadn't had an unarticulated policy, something in  black and white that said, this is what this is what, you know, what we're expecting of  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:07):**  our suppliers.  So we created that with input from Compassion in World Farming and World Animal Protection,  who were really helpful in kind of challenging us and helping us to kind of define what that  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:19):**  should look like.  And then I think another big step forward was we invested in, I suppose, a software  tool, which enables us to collate and track data from all of our suppliers.  
**[0:05:34-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:34):**  So 30 suppliers across three continents and basically track and measure welfare metrics.  These specifically are measuring outcomes, aren't they, rather than just input.  So it's not about providing the opportunity for good welfare.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:49):**  It's about actually measuring that that welfare has occurred.  Exactly.  And yeah, so I think that just also gave us a bit more confidence that actually now we've  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:05:57):**  got a tool that we can actually track and measure improvement.  What it covers is all the chicken that we buy in to the UK business.  So a good chunk of that obviously does come from the UK and Ireland.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:12):**  So all of the chicken which goes into our bucket, so all of our classic chicken on the  bone original recipe is UK sauce, chicken, Red Tractor standard.  And then we buy to the same welfare standard from other parts of the world.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:29):**  So some comes from Europe, some comes from Thailand, some small amounts come from Brazil.  Signing the European Chicken Commitment is a big deal for KFC UK and Ireland.  It's a leap of faith and the company has been frank in saying that there isn't a clear roadmap  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:45):**  for how to deliver.  Part of the challenge is that KFC is part of an integrated supply chain.  Though big, they only represent 4% of the UK chicken market and they don't have dedicated  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:06:56):**  producers or chicken houses.  Look at it this way.  If KFC only buys 10% of a farmer's birds from a given house, then that farmer is less likely  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:05):**  to want to take their direction.  A farmer ideally needs their customers to have the same system requirements so that  as producers they're not stuck between two mutually incompatible systems.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:15):**  KFC has taken an important leadership position and now the company is working with other  major buyers, particularly the retailers that make up the lion's share of the UK chicken  market to help ensure that these really big supermarkets can also step up and sign the  
**[0:07:31-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:31):**  commitment.  However, regardless of the nuts and bolts, KFC is confident that they can deliver on  the commitment.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:38):**  This is partly because they're already measuring welfare outcomes and have 20 years experience  of monitoring the success of management changes and interventions to improve welfare across  their supply chain.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:07:50):**  But the question remains, why has KFC signed up to the commitment now?  So I think why now is people care more than ever about their food, the ethics of how it  was raised, what they're putting inside their body.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:05):**  You know, I think there is something very visceral about, you know, how we feel about  our food because ultimately we're putting it inside ourselves.  So we want to feel safe and secure about that.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:16):**  And we also, I think people are increasingly aware of the impact that food production,  food systems, global agriculture, all of this, the impact it has on the world and the environment.  Jenny Packwood from KFC.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:32):**  That's given us some idea of the motivations companies might have for signing the European  Chicken Commitment.  So now let's delve into more of the detail.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:40):**  The commitment is science-led.  The six requirements are chosen because they'll all make a demonstrable difference to the lives  of meat chickens, meaning improvements to both broiler welfare and to bird health.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:08:52):**  However, it's welfare that's at the heart of the commitment and the ability to demonstrate  natural behaviours is the keystone of welfare science.  The first element of the commitment that I want to look at is environmental enrichment,  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:04):**  which includes the use of natural light, perching and pecking substrates.  FAI Farms works with major food brands and advises them on the delivery of food sustainability,  including farm animal welfare.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:16):**  Annie Rayner is their research coordinator.  She's also working on a PhD in broiler welfare.  I started by asking Annie about the role natural behaviour plays in measuring good chicken  
**[0:09:28-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:28):**  welfare.  So obviously there's a range of behaviours, some of which are good for welfare and some  perhaps would be considered not so good for welfare.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:37):**  So anti-predatory responses, so running away from a predator perhaps wouldn't be so good  for the welfare of an animal.  But behaviours that are positively reinforcing or what we kind of define as positive behaviours,  
**[0:09:50-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:09:50):**  so ones that they're really motivated to do, bring enjoyment or are beneficial for their  health.  So for broilers, if you look towards things like dust bathing, it's really important to  
**[0:10:01-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:01):**  provide friable litter.  They're really motivated to dust bathe.  We know that in laying hens in a cage system, they'll still look to dust bathe, even though  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:09):**  there's no substrate there available to them.  And what's the point of dust bathing?  So with dust bathing, essentially they're realigning all of their feathers.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:18):**  In the wild, it would have been a way of controlling parasites.  So introducing dust into their feathers and then shaking them out again, hopefully taking  the parasites with them.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:30):**  Feathers are also barbed and it just realigns them, just smooths them out again, increasing  their kind of water resistance and general kind of health of their feathers.  So broilers, even though we're obviously keeping them in an indoor environment with not so  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:43):**  many parasites or no parasites, they're still really motivated to do this dust bathing  behaviour.  Ani Rayner.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:10:51):**  Kelly Watson is a programme manager for FAI Farms and has particular expertise in delivering  improvements in broiler systems.  I asked her to try and explain environmental enrichment from a chicken's perspective in  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:04):**  terms of what do the birds actually want?  What the birds want is stimulation and some things do that better than others.  But one thing I think people miss in terms of enrichment for broilers is providing a  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:15):**  really great friable litter or bedding helps them exhibit those natural behaviours that  we see, which would be scratching and dust bathing, as well as the kind of need to peck.  You know, that would be a thing that they did when they were in the jungle, their ancestors,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:30):**  you know, looking for food.  So quite often in broiler houses, you'll see CDs or cable ties or some people may even  be, you know, using brassicas or anything hung up just for the birds to peck.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:42):**  And ideally you want them to have a reward for doing it.  Kelly Watson.  Let's go back to Ani Rayner to consider the role of natural light.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:11:50):**  For chickens, vision is their dominant sense.  They really rely on a natural or a light environment.  They've got a different spectral sensitivity to humans.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:00):**  So they can see into the UV spectrum, which is provided by natural light, although can  be filtered through a lot of windows and such.  But either way, they need a light environment.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:11):**  And actually what we've tended to do historically is darken down the environment so that they  stay quieter so that they aren't as active and so that all of that energy is put into  building up meat, obviously, for consumption.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:26):**  So providing a natural environment in the UK, we tend to do it down the sides of the  sheds, which does provide quite a nice variation across the shed.  So you see that the birds use the different light environments quite differently.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:40):**  So in the middle, perhaps where it's a bit darker, you tend to see quite a lot of resting  birds, whereas along the sides where we've got the windows, you tend to see much more  active behaviours, so things like sparring or playing or running around, you see them  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:12:56):**  scratching at the litter and foraging or searching for food.  Stocking density is one of the most economically challenging elements of the European chicken  commitment, which requires a shift from 38 kilograms per metre squared to 30 kilograms  
**[0:13:11-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:11):**  per metre squared.  I asked Annie to set out why stocking density is so important to broiler welfare.  And then I asked Kelly to explain how stocking density is measured.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:22):**  The higher stocking density is obviously if you have more birds in a shed, you're more  likely as a chicken, if you're walking from one place to another, you're more likely to  hit another bird if there are more birds there essentially.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:34):**  So by reducing stocking density, you're reducing crowding, you're increasing the available  space to perform quite a lot of these behaviours or the more active behaviours.  Having a higher stocking density as well, it puts quite a lot of pressure on the environment.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:13:48):**  It makes it maybe slightly harder to manage in terms of the litter.  So if you've got more birds on the litter, essentially you've got more for faeces, it's  harder to perhaps keep that dry or to ensure that that is of a good quality.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:02):**  So litter obviously has a big impact on the behaviours they perform, but also impacts  upon hop burn and pododermatitis, which are painful conditions really for chickens.  So the 38 kilos is measured at a single point.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:18):**  So when we're talking about stocking density, we're talking about the maximum stocking density  allowed.  That will be the birds when they're small will grow and fill a space and then at some  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:27):**  point they will hit 38 kilos a metre squared, at which case the house needs to be cleared  or thinned to either allow birds to grow on or for the cycle to finish.  Kelly just mentioned thinning.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:40):**  Now the commitment says that thinning, if it's practised, should be limited to one thin  per flock.  But what is thinning?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:48):**  We thin birds in commercial systems, really driven by the economics.  So what we're doing is we're growing birds to the maximum stocking density permitted.  So let's say that's 38 kilos.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:14:58):**  So we grow the birds in the house, we get them to 38 kilos and then we take a proportion  out, which is called a thin, that might be 25 to 30% of the house gets removed.  Those birds will be say at 1.85 kilos live weight.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:14):**  They get taken to the factory and then they will get used as any other chicken would.  So they will get used to produce chicken portions or whole chickens or wherever they need to  go.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:25):**  And then the remainder of the chickens are left in the house to grow on again.  So basically what the thin does is maximise the return in terms of kilos of meat that  can be produced from the house.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:35):**  Now when we see a reduction in stocking density from say 38 to 30, what we're seeing is the  number of birds that you can put in the house to start with is less.  So for a farmer, this means potentially he's got less kilos of meat he can produce because  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:15:51):**  he's got less birds to produce them from.  It also means that the inputs required to run that house, such as the heating and the  lighting and all the things that go around that, those inputs go up per bird, price per  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:05):**  bird, because you've got less birds to spread the cost over.  So this is the impact that stocking density has in terms of the economics for the farmer  and for the processor.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:15):**  That cost of production goes up because you're having less birds for every metre squared  that you have available to grow them.  The other big economic challenge is the requirement to move from a fast growing breed to a more  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:29):**  slow growing bird that meets the criteria of the RSPCA, Broiler Breed Welfare Assessment  Protocol.  I asked Annie Rayner why breed is so important.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:39):**  So with the slower growing birds, we know they have fewer health issues.  They're putting less energy perhaps into growth and perhaps just taking a little bit  more time for that immune system and immune function to develop and support them.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:16:55):**  So we have benefits in terms of general kind of pathologies and there's suggested benefits  in terms of reduced antibiotic use, probably from that reduction in pathologies.  In terms of walking ability as well, we tend to see fewer birds that need to be culled  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:12):**  because of having bad legs.  We can see that they can walk much better.  They have a much more fluid motion of walking and generally less lameness.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:23):**  And then I guess because of that, you get that knock on effect of a more mobile bird  that's able to perform more of these positive behaviours that we've been talking about.  So they're more able to get up onto perches, they're more able to run around and perhaps  
**[0:17:38-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:38):**  act more like a chicken.  So breed makes an enormous difference in terms of broiler welfare.  But what about the practicalities of making the change?  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:17:48):**  Let's go back to Kelly Watson.  So the big one really in terms of breed is availability of that breeding stock.  So availability of the broiler breeders that are required to lay the eggs for the broiler  
**[0:18:01-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:01):**  birds.  So that goes right back to the hatcheries and the parent stock and grandparent stock.  So if you imagine the chicken supply chain as a pipeline, so it's constantly, it never  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:14):**  stops and to make sure that we always have chicken meat coming through.  So bringing those breeds in requires a lot of planning and it requires changes and that  availability issue is a big one.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:27):**  Because if we're suddenly asking a breed company, for example, Hubbard, to suddenly shift up  a gear into the amount of breeding birds it has to produce more parent stock to lay the  broilers, that requires them to do so.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:43):**  And that change is not overnight.  It takes time to get those birds on the ground to lay the eggs and go through the system.  So it is a big ask, this breed one.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:18:51):**  And of course, everyone is very wary because that investment is big as well.  So when you start making changes to your system and you're talking about big changes, that  investment requires people to be confident that it's not a flash in the pan.  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:06):**  So it's about if you want, for example, someone is asking their chicken supplier to change  their breed, that chicken supplier will want reassurance that they're going to fulfil this  requirement because it's a big change and it's a big investment to make that shift.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:23):**  So the broiler ask is for these changes to be in place by 1st of January 2026.  In terms of breed change, at what point before 2026 does that decision finally need to have  been made in order that that parent stock will have worked its way through the system?  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:44):**  So this is a bit of a difficult one because there's so many moving parts involved.  But it will depend on how many chickens are required.  And it will depend, you know, it will depend on whether people already have stock down.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:19:56):**  But let's just let's just say, for example, you speak to your chicken supplier and you  ask, you say we want to change a breed.  So I think probably you'd be looking in a good scenario of at least 18 months to two  
**[0:20:08-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:08):**  years to get the first two years.  That's remarkable.  The first chickens through the system.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:13):**  So it's important to realise that it won't just be a case of going from the 1st of January  2026, we're all suddenly going to change from a standard breed on the 31st of December into  a slow growing breed on the 1st of January because it doesn't work like that.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:28):**  There's a system and the numbers have to work through the system.  So you know, you're placing if you like in sequence.  So as for example, one standard breed of flock goes out producing standard birds that would  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:40):**  be replaced with a slow growing breed of flock.  But that means that actually your transition may take two years for you to start.  But then depending on how many birds you need a week, you know, there'll be a period of  
**[0:20:53-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:20:53):**  time when that can be fulfilled just because of the way the supply chain works.  So I mean, you are talking and that's in, you know, providing the breeding stock is  available and everything else.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:02):**  So you know, minimum two years really for 18 months to two years just to get to start  the slower growing breed coming through the system.  So really, when we think about the broiler ask that there were there were two kind of  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:15):**  big fundamental asks here.  One is that a company, you know, makes that first commitment and economic commitment to  change their business model so that so that it works and it fits with this transition  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:27):**  to slower growing breeds in particular to to lower stocking densities.  But then there's there's just simply the practical challenge of implementing that change and  and frankly, to get it delivered by 2026 companies that have signed up to this are about to sign  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:42):**  up to it, they kind of need to get on with it.  Yeah, they do.  And it needs to be planned.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:21:47):**  So there's no there's no way around this, it needs to be planned and then and there  needs to be a proper, you know, timeline or roadmap put in place if people are going to  hit that hit that deadline and 2026 is not is not far away.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:00):**  The last big element of the European Chicken Commitment aims to improve welfare at slaughter.  This requires a shift to controlled atmospheric stunning or to effective electrical stunning  without live shackling and inversion.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:14):**  With the controlled atmospheric stunning or CAS stunning, and there's fewer kind of components  can perhaps go wrong and fewer components that also negatively impact on the welfare  of the birds.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:24):**  So with the CAS stunning, you're not taking those birds or handling those birds between  the crates that they arrive on the lorry at the slaughter plant and then them going through  to processing so they remain in the crates.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:37):**  So there's a removal of a handling stage and then also in electric stunning when when they  are being handled, they're being inverted.  So they're fully live, fully conscious, and they are being turned upside down in this  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:49):**  strange environment, obviously quite loud, quite aversive really to the birds.  We also know that birds struggle to breathe when they're upside down because of this lack  of diaphragm.  
**[0:22:59-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:22:59):**  There's a lot of pressures on their lungs, which is stressful.  We know that that inversion is a stressful phase and it is a required phase within the  kind of current electric systems.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:11):**  You remove the possibility of pre-stun shocks.  So essentially, if you have birds that are going through or just about to reach into  the water bath, there's a possibility of water kind of flicking up and then getting slight  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:25):**  electric shocks, but not enough to fully make them unconscious.  You also know that we get quite a variation in bird size, which can then impact upon the  current that's going through the birds, which then means you can get some inadequate stunning.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:42):**  Whereas in the CAS system, they're all put in together.  They're monitored to make sure that the stunning is effective.  But there's less of these kind of less moving parts, I guess.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:23:53):**  You've got less kind of impacts upon welfare through kind of handling the birds through  these pre-stun shocks.  And obviously that can then have impacts not on the welfare, but also on the carcass quality.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:06):**  So fewer breaks and bruises perhaps you see with the CAS system, which are obviously painful  as well for the birds if they happen before they're stunned.  And what about the gas mix?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:14):**  Yeah, so we know that carbon dioxide isn't the, it's an aversive gas.  It causes irritation to the eyes and the throat.  We know that there are better, more inert gases.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:26):**  So argon or nitrogen, I think is better for the welfare of the birds, but it's more expensive.  It's not a byproduct that the carbon dioxide is currently of the fertiliser industry.  So it's quite relatively readily available, though last year we had some struggles with  
**[0:24:43-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:43):**  accessing it.  Many reiner.  One of the criticisms of the European Chicken Commitment is that it's focused on a single  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:24:49):**  issue, welfare.  In the round, sustainability requires a holistic or whole farm approach.  And there's a danger that when you promote one aspect of sustainability, you can have  
**[0:25:00-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:00):**  a negative impact on others.  Put simply here, if birds live longer, then they require more feed and other inputs, potentially  increasing the environmental impacts of that farm system.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:11):**  I asked Kelly Watson to consider the overall impacts of the commitment.  This is an interesting one because obviously the European Chicken Commitment is kind of  a single issue.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:21):**  So it's looking at welfare, but it's not looking at potentially at sustainability in the whole.  So we know, as you've just pointed out, that those birds are alive longer.  And we know that, for example, roughly 20% of a chicken's diet will be soya and around  
**[0:25:36-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:36):**  60% will be wheat.  So we know that there's a certain amount of grain that goes into those into those birds  and we know that they'll eat more because they're alive longer.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:44):**  So this, I guess for me, there's a piece practically about are we assuming, is the industry assuming  that everything carries on as normal and we still have the 10 day turnaround and we still  use the same feed ingredients?  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:25:58):**  Or is there now a time to think about, well, if I'm investing in new housing, should I  be looking at houses that perhaps I can shorten the time they're empty between crops so that  I can get more birds through potentially without damaging my biosecurity or my cleaning system,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:13):**  cleaning those houses and making sure they're suitable?  And can I look at alternative feed ingredients?  So there's lots of talk about insect protein.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:23):**  There's talk about could you use more, say, grass in broiler diets.  There's lots of thoughts about can we try and offset some of the impact of this by looking  at things differently and investing perhaps in new technology, new innovation and looking  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:39):**  at, for example, different feed ingredients.  So good welfare and good environmental outcomes can be coupled in this instance?  They can.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:47):**  I don't I think it's it's difficult if everything stays the same.  So what needs to change?  So then I mean, there's obviously there's a need to look at, you know, how do we how  
**[0:26:58-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:26:58):**  do we manage these birds?  How do we how do we look at the system and think about how we can minimise the impact?  But the you know, the biggest one, I guess, is about do we need to produce the same number  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:09):**  of birds or do we try and get margin and look to produce less?  So it's a very controversial issue.  And the chicken producers in the country will not be happy with me saying that.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:18):**  Neither will the chicken processors.  But, you know, that's one of the things we've got to think about.  You've indicated, you know, should we be eating as much or should we should we be looking  
**[0:27:27-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:27):**  for everybody to make the profit in the business that they need to, but potentially produce  in less?  That's a really controversial one, but it's one that we've got to think about.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:35):**  Kelly Watson there explaining how the European chicken commitment could lead to better sustainability  overall, providing food businesses look at the commitment as an opportunity to further  develop their overall business models.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:27:48):**  I went back to Jenny Packwood to ask how KFC plans to address these issues.  One of the difficult things with the commitment is that no one quite knows how it's going  to play out.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:00):**  There are cost implications of moving to a slower growing breed.  That is the change of breed is the single biggest challenge.  Do you think that you'll be able to bring your customers with you, even if your menus  
**[0:28:12-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:12):**  and your prices change in order to meet the commitment?  That's a really good question.  And I think ultimately, yes, that's part of our job is that and our challenge is that  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:23):**  we will have to take the customer on the journey with us.  And I suspect that's going to take some time.  I think we're certainly we're not going to do anything drastic overnight.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:33):**  It has to be a journey.  But there is a reality that if chicken becomes meat in general becomes more expensive, all  businesses are going to have to revisit their models and how they price things and so on  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:28:49):**  with the consumer.  But who knows how many years that will take.  But I think I do think it is critical that we keep communicating and keep engaging the  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:00):**  customer as much as we can about why welfare is important in order to take them on that  journey.  Because you can't just suddenly turn around to someone and say, oh, well, now your chicken  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:11):**  might be more expensive.  You know, there is only so much you can pass on.  I think there is so much excitement and pride in our business that we have signed up and  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:21):**  that we were the first in our sector to sign up to this.  It's been really galvanizing for us across the entire business to say this is what we're  lining up behind.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:32):**  You know, as I said, we've got chicken in our name.  It's the right thing for us to be on the front foot and pushing for improvements in welfare  for all chickens.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-European-Chicken-Commitment--KFC-eb1216#t=0:29:42):**  And yeah, that's something we feel really passionate about.

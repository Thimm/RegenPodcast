### Farm Gate  (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:27:33)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Land Unlocked, a collaboration from the Food, Farming and Countryside Commission  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:10):**  and the Farmgate podcast. I'm Finnlow Costayne, the chief executive of Farmwell, and in this  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:15):**  series, I'm talking about land use, with influential figures from the UK and around  
**[0:00:19-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:19):**  the world in the run-up to COP26 in Glasgow this November. In this programme, we're  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:25):**  discussing corporate sustainability and greenwash. Is it possible for large companies to become  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:31):**  genuinely sustainable, or will greed always triumph over green?  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:36):**  Bennett Northcote is a senior advisor at Seahorse Environmental and the deputy chair of the  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:40):**  Conservative Environment Network. Prior to that, he was the director of corporate responsibility  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:45):**  for the John Lewis Partnership, and before that, he worked as deputy private secretary  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:50):**  to the Prince of Wales and as chief policy advisor at Greenpeace UK.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:54):**  Ed Gillespie is a facilitator for the Forward Institute and a co-founder of the sustainability  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:00:59):**  agency Futera. Ed has travelled the world to deliver talks and inspiration to hundreds  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:04):**  of companies and other organisations, and is the co-presenter of the podcasts John Richardson  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:09):**  and the Futrenauts and The Great Humbling. Ed is also a director of Greenpeace UK. Welcome  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:15):**  both.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:16):**  Thank you very much for asking us.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:17):**  Bennett, I want to come to you first. There is a fallacy that companies have a duty to  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:21):**  maximise profit, when actually, and quite explicitly in UK law, there is instead a duty  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:27):**  to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. In  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:32):**  the face of climate breakdown, and with biodiversity also in crisis, what does a successful company  
**[0:01:38-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:38):**  look like?  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:39):**  It's really interesting, this debate about the profit versus the purpose. I'm firmly  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:43):**  of the view that you can't separate them out and put them in opposition to each other.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:49):**  The members of a company are also the shareholders and the investors and the people who have  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:52):**  lent it money. There's no question that a company has to continue to be profitable in  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:01:57):**  what it does if it's to survive, and basic economics tells you that. The question really  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:01):**  is, where are those profits coming from, and what are they doing to the people involved  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:07):**  in generating those profits and to the natural resources that are used in making and generating  
**[0:02:12-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:12):**  those profits? And that's the question that needs to happen for a company to be successful.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:17):**  I think there's two things I'd say. The first is just building on that point that obviously,  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:22):**  a good company, a successful company, one that is leaving in its wake, a horrendous  
**[0:02:27-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:27):**  destruction of people's likelihoods, the destruction of nature and biodiversity on a grand scale,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:33):**  can't pass any test of value or sense of long-term value creation in a self-sustaining way because  
**[0:02:40-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:40):**  companies have to exist within the ecosystems in which they operate. So if they're destroying  
**[0:02:45-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:45):**  that ecosystem, they're not going to have any real long-term survivability. They might  
**[0:02:49-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:49):**  make a lot of money on the way, of course, and that's one of the tensions because a company  
**[0:02:52-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:52):**  can continue to make a lot of money while doing bad things. One thinks about tobacco  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:02:56):**  companies. I remember somebody from a tobacco company talking years and years ago, and they  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:01):**  said, yeah, we recognize this business model is bad and people die from it and all these  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:05):**  sort of things, but it's a melting iceberg, right? That's a lot of money to be made while  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:08):**  the iceberg melts. So the final point really is understanding what sort of actually companies  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:13):**  are going to need to succeed. And I'm really sort of quite an optimistic phase actually,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:17):**  which I think we're at the start of a really great transition on sustainability and the  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:21):**  economy is transitioning to become more sustainable and more sustainable. And so for companies  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:27):**  to be successful, they're going to have to become sustainable to operate within that  
**[0:03:31-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:31):**  economy. Otherwise, they're just going to simply be left behind. It's a bit like the  
**[0:03:34-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:34):**  dot-com boom and the technology boom we saw where the internet was a fringe activity and  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:38):**  sitting on the side of everything. And now you can't even publish a parish magazine without  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:43):**  using the internet in some form. And I think sustainability is on that same journey. So  
**[0:03:47-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:47):**  ultimately, this is a set of profitability and sustainability will just be the same thing.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:51):**  That get rich quick sort of model that you've talked about with tobacco companies or even  
**[0:03:55-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:55):**  oil companies as it would be at the moment, you know, just keep on making as much money  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:03:59):**  as we possibly can until we can't do that anymore. Is there a sense to which that simply  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:04):**  isn't serving the shareholder? I think that's really the nub of what you're saying that  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:08):**  shareholders may get rich quick, but in terms of the company itself, it's just sort of setting  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:12):**  itself up for a failure in the future. Yeah, without doubt. I mean, and I think if  
**[0:04:16-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:16):**  you look at the returns from the international oil measures, they're not necessarily being  
**[0:04:21-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:21):**  consistently great. I don't think Exxon has done fantastically well with its share price  
**[0:04:24-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:24):**  over the years. So actually, you could argue for some of these companies, they've misjudged  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:28):**  it already in terms of the change. But yeah, that's absolutely got to be true. But you  
**[0:04:32-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:32):**  know, if you're going to do disaster capitalism, you've got to be very fleet of foot with your  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:35):**  time, how you're going to do your investments, right? So it's more about the basis of the  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:40):**  way that the economy fundamentally operates, I think is the only way through this.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:44):**  So we talked there about economics sort of more generally in companies in the round,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:47):**  but you were director of corporate responsibility at the John Lewis Partnership. So in layman's  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:51):**  terms, what does that mean? What did you actually do?  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:54):**  John Lewis Partnership, of course, a large retailer, two of the major UK brands, John  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:04:59):**  Lewis shops and Waitrose supermarket. So I was in this group function in the middle.  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:04):**  And we also had quite an old fashioned job title. I was sort of director of corporate  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:06):**  responsibility was quite old fashioned. And a lot of my colleagues were chief sustainability  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:11):**  officers or purpose visionaries, all these kind of things. I rather like the job title  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:16):**  actually, because I think it comes down to actually, you know, this point about, you  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:18):**  know, actually how you in any society, you have rights and you have obligations, right,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:22):**  and you have to discharge your obligations to access your rights. So you know, really  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:26):**  what the job was, was responsible for three big areas. The first obviously, sustainability  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:31):**  across both the John Lewis retail supply chain and the Waitrose supply chain. So that's 350  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:36):**  to 50,000 products across both brands. So there wasn't really anything we sold that  
**[0:05:42-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:42):**  didn't have some sort of footprint to it. And so you're always thinking about the management  
**[0:05:45-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:45):**  and how you would be in that school. Secondly, the very important, you know, D&I agenda,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:52):**  and the whole question of how do you ensure the business is both inclusive for society  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:05:57):**  as a whole, and inclusive for people working, partners working in the business. And then  
**[0:06:03-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:03):**  finally, operational health and safety.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:04):**  Jason Vale, The Guardian, I'm interested in the way that you frame the job titles there.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:08):**  And I wonder, Ed, if you've got any thoughts, you know, because you've spoken to a lot of  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:11):**  companies over the course of your career, whether there is a degree to which having  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:15):**  a corporate responsibility director is just sort of inherently putting those things in  
**[0:06:20-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:20):**  a silo and separating them out actually, from the rest of the business.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:23):**  Well, I think it really depends on the business. I mean, the example I always use is the financial  
**[0:06:38-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:38):**  function, which had no influence at all over what the bank was doing, and, you know, made  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:53):**  good noises and was very credible. But the trouble was, it wasn't influencing the engine  
**[0:06:54-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:54):**  at the heart of the organisation and hence the crisis. I think that's changed now. And  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:55):**  I would sort of agree with Bennett in one sense, it's like once you get board accountability  
**[0:06:59-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:06:59):**  and responsibility for these type of functions, then it can act as an aggregator. The problem,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:05):**  again, has always been when it's been in one or two tiers below the C-suite, where it doesn't  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:10):**  necessarily have the voice. And I think now, I'm not necessarily an optimist, I would term  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:15):**  a dark optimist, because I think it's going to get messy. I think it's going to get painful,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:20):**  because the time for a comfortable transition has kind of passed, you know, we are at a  
**[0:07:26-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:26):**  pace and scale and urgency of change, which is going to mean that the ground shifts underneath  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:32):**  organisations far more quickly than they're comfortable with. I'm playing to Bennett's  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:36):**  sort of melting iceberg point. I think that's the problem, particularly executives in organisations  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:41):**  can see that business models continue to make money. And they're reluctant to wean themselves  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:47):**  off those practices, even though they can see where the future is perhaps going, but  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:52):**  we're still sort of hobbled by a degree of short termism. And I think, you know, the  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:07:56):**  oil and gas sector is not a bad example of this, because, you know, they've seen, they've  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:01):**  seen what's coming for decades. And they've actively obfuscated, resisted, dug their heels  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:06):**  in, tried to slow the pace of change, even if it's not active denial, it's sort of denial  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:12):**  of the swiftness required. And now they're in a really, really painful position, because  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:17):**  the world, and this is where I agree with Bennett, I think there is a big seismic movement  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:22):**  going on now where suddenly, it's going to be really horrible for them. They've had the  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:26):**  opportunity, they've had the escape routes, they've had the avenues of diversification,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:30):**  innovation available to them, and they haven't taken them. And that's because they've made  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:35):**  very good money out of the status quo. And, you know, particularly when you can see so  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:40):**  called alternative energy in the form of renewables now making up 37% of the grid mix, you know,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:46):**  you're starting to get to these tipping points where demand will peak. And the problem from  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:51):**  their sort of executive perspective, and you know, you're seeing these shareholder evolts  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:08:54):**  now in excellent places where shareholders are going, hang on, why have you not seen  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:00):**  the way that this agenda is unfolding? And actually, that's irresponsible. And that's  
**[0:09:04-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:04):**  not serving either the shareholders or the wider society. I mean, big oil and gas wrote  
**[0:09:09-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:09):**  down $100 billion worth of assets during the pandemic, because of negative oil prices.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:15):**  You know, the issue has been, it's not that you can't make money out of renewables, it's  
**[0:09:19-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:19):**  that you couldn't make quite as much money as you could out of conventional oil and gas  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:23):**  at the time. I think there's lots of stuff going on. And what's really required now is,  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:28):**  you know, some genuine courage in our leadership, where we're not necessarily going to be able  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:33):**  to see every step of the journey that has to be undertaken. And particularly, we might  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:37):**  not always have the data to justify it.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:39):**  So, Ed, I'm interested in where that change comes from. Because, you know, some companies  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:43):**  like John Lewis, they are blazing that sustainability trail, but others, as we've already identified,  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:48):**  not so much. So, do you think the corporate world is going to change in the same way that  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:53):**  somebody who's had an unhealthy diet of pizzas and chips for most of their lives and has  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:09:58):**  suddenly started getting heart problems, suddenly then decides they need to start eating lettuce?  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:03):**  Do you think the corporate world is going to change by itself enough in time and of  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:07):**  its own accord? Or do we need to change the law? Do we need tougher laws and greater public  
**[0:10:12-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:12):**  pressure?  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:13):**  Well, I've sort of said, you know, voluntarily, no. There are some enlightened pioneers who  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:18):**  say have read the rooms, can see where the world is going. And also, I do think there's  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:22):**  a distinction here between sort of legal and moral responsibility, because there's often  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:26):**  an argument within large corporates, so we're not breaking any laws here. I said, yeah,  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:30):**  but it's not just about that legal bottom line. It's actually, what's your moral responsibility  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:35):**  and how is that legal framework likely to shift around you? You know, the landmark ruling  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:40):**  in the Netherlands requiring Shell to cut its carbon emissions in scope three by 45%  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:46):**  by 2030 is potentially game changing. And it's going to involve probably years of litigation  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:51):**  and counter appeal. But this responsibility is now being forced onto companies. And you  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:10:56):**  know, if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu. So I do think there will be a  
**[0:11:01-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:01):**  drumbeat now of increasingly hardcore regulation, legislation and litigation. You know, that  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:09):**  Netherlands case was bought by 17,000 Dutch citizens in conjunction with a bunch of environmental  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:13):**  groups. So that is going to increase. We're going to see that happening in the run up  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:17):**  to COP26 and probably after because it's the only way that that pressure will come on.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:22):**  Public pressure plays a role, undoubtedly, but I don't believe it's just customers. I  
**[0:11:27-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:27):**  mean, my old buddy John Grant used to say, you know, there's a dark, mysterious and insidious  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:33):**  force, you know, that has enormous influence in the world. And when it moves on mass, it's  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:38):**  irresistible. And it's called public opinion. But harnessing that and focusing that is a  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:44):**  dark art, you know, and that's what organisations like Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion, Friends  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:49):**  of the Earth, everyone else has been involved and Client Earth have been very good at is  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:11:54):**  actually using the law, exposing the Achilles heels, you know, making it transparent where  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:00):**  businesses are behaving irresponsibly, even if it is just about legal. And I think there  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:06):**  is some public outrage that comes from that. I mean, that's the whole notion of boycotts  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:10):**  and trying to bring these things into the public imagination. But, you know, it's got  
**[0:12:14-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:14):**  to be both. It's got to be about public pressure and it will be this kind of quite sharp legislation  
**[0:12:20-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:20):**  and regulation at the same time.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:22):**  Bennett, I'm going to come back to you because Waitrose is different. It's always been the  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:25):**  leader in this area for decades anyway and taken a, you know, a leadership role. And  
**[0:12:31-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:31):**  I wonder who was driving the change within that brand? Was it coming from the staff?  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:37):**  Was it coming from the customers? Was it coming from the farmers?  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:41):**  Waitrose is a wonderful, wonderful business. I was fortunate to, in a sense, just be a  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:44):**  steward of a culture that would preceded me and will live long after me. And you asked  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:50):**  why. I mean, a lot of it comes down to the rather unique ownership structure that the  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:54):**  John Lewis Partnership has because it's an employee owned business and it's unique, I  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:12:59):**  think, in corporate that is actually governed by a constitution. It's not unique, but it's  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:03):**  only in large businesses and it's your largest employee owned business. But it's governed  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:08):**  by a constitution which sets out sort of the principles on which the business will operate.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:13):**  You know, starting with happiness of partners to worthwhile employment in a successful business.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:17):**  You know, sharing the benefit, you know, the benefits of ownership, profit, knowledge and  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:21):**  power and that sort of sense. But then drives through about responsibilities to the community.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:26):**  And there were a set of rules that included, you know, the rules on minimising waste and  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:31):**  ensuring sustainable outcomes as best as possible. So I think you've got why there's a lot there.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:36):**  You can go deeper into why that's commercially successful. I don't think you can ignore that  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:42):**  for Waitrose, there is a healthy dynamic between the price customers are prepared to pay for  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:47):**  the product, the higher standards that go into the production of those products and  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:52):**  the quality, therefore, that comes with the products and the higher production standards.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:55):**  So there's a very economically, there's always been a good virtuous circle. And so Waitrose  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:13:59):**  has played a role without any question in pulling the rest of the UK food industry behind  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:04):**  it. It's very easy to say Waitrose, that's fine, premium supermarket, super serve in  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:08):**  the top 5%. And you know, it's wonderful, if only everybody could afford to shop in  
**[0:14:12-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:12):**  Waitrose, but they can't. And actually, I would argue Waitrose is actually pretty price  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:15):**  competitive in a lot of skews. But what it does do is it enables, it sort of raises the  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:20):**  bar. There is really a question that does raise the bar for a lot of the industry and  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:24):**  set standards and set approaches, which others can then follow. And then it does come from  
**[0:14:29-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:29):**  customers. It comes from all those stakeholders you talk about, it comes from the farmers  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:32):**  and so on. And it does come from a culture internally of actually wanting to start by  
**[0:14:37-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:37):**  trying to do the right thing. You know, the partnership does not seek to maximise profit,  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:41):**  it seeks to make sufficient profit.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:43):**  For other companies, you know, there's always a lot of talk about customer power, and shoppers,  
**[0:14:47-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:47):**  you know, from NGOs telling us that we need to put pressure onto the brands that we like  
**[0:14:52-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:52):**  to make them more sustainable. My question head is, does it work? Do companies, especially  
**[0:14:57-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:14:57):**  big companies, really listen to us, the little people?  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:00):**  They do a bit. It's not a simple binary. It's not that yes, they do and it's incredibly  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:05):**  influential or no, they don't at all. I think somewhere in the middle there, you get the  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:09):**  defensiveness, you know, so when companies can feel like they come under attack, then  
**[0:15:13-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:13):**  that can often drive change in a way which is faster and more systemic than they might  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:19):**  have previously planned. And the trouble is those points tend to be quite focused, you  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:26):**  know, so if you look at it from an NGO campaigning perspective, you've got to try and keep it  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:30):**  simple. And yeah, and sometimes that reductive simplicity can also be part of the problem.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:33):**  You know, as well, you know, about some of the issues in terms of farming and agriculture  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:38):**  and land use, you know, the debate is often actually in reality, quite nuanced, but a  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:43):**  campaigning organisation will go, we need a simple message that we can take out there.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:47):**  So you know, we need to talk about the problem with so-called dolphin friendly tuna. So you  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:52):**  get a very sharp spike, which will then target a John West or a large producer or the retailers  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:15:58):**  that are selling that product. And that can be quite effective, but it's much more difficult  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:03):**  if you're saying, well, actually, we want to run a campaign on soil health, you know,  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:08):**  which could be interpreted through a hundred different lenses about how do we actually  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:14):**  cultivate and culture a beautiful, diverse, fertile soil underneath our feet, you know,  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:20):**  and that might involve permaculture, you know, the right type of regenerative livestock farming,  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:25):**  you know, a very diversified agrarian, arable crop type of rotation system, you know, and  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:32):**  suddenly all that suddenly you're dealing with some very, very difficult stuff to which  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:36):**  there are, to be honest, not very clear and simple answers. Again, you have to have the  
**[0:16:40-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:40):**  courage.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:41):**  Just kind of save the worm. That's what we need.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:43):**  Almost. I mean, almost, you know, and then again, this is about leadership, isn't it?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:48):**  It's about leadership in that organization and say, we don't necessarily have all the  
**[0:16:51-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:51):**  answers here. We know we're going to have to experiment. We're going to have to have  
**[0:16:54-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:54):**  lots of different pilot systems, which are going to have to be implemented quite quickly.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:16:59):**  We're going to have to do a bit of suck it and see. And I think that's also where the  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:04):**  confidence comes from about moving on from existing practices, because no one wants the  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:09):**  risk to blow back in their face either. And so we have to have a more forgiving corporate  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:14):**  culture which allows errors and failures to happen at the same time as hopefully progressing  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:21):**  things in the right direction. But, you know, the final point I'd make on that is I just  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:26):**  think we're not in the era of incrementalism anymore. You know, I do think the ambition  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:30):**  of transformation is really starting to unfold now. And so you can't just tweak, especially  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:37):**  if we start to look at something like net zero, we've got to halve emissions by 2030,  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:42):**  which is only just eight and a half years away. And that's on everyone's watch. You  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:46):**  know, I do a lot of talks to CEOs and you see them when you're going, this is your tenure,  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:51):**  you know, and you're going to halve the emissions of your organization in your tenure. And most  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:17:56):**  of them have not comprehended the fact that that will not be achievable through existing  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:00):**  business models.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:01):**  Do you find, do you find it, do you find that just thinking about that, you know, we've  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:05):**  been told there are only 10 years to save the planet several times now over the course  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:09):**  of the last 30 years, are companies actually really genuinely listening to it and say,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:14):**  oh yes, no, this, this time you really mean it.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:17):**  Yeah, well, I know Bennett and I are sort of long enough in the tooth to have remembered  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:21):**  as you say, many of those warnings. I've always been a little bit adverse to them, but I do  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:26):**  think, you know, something began to shift about three years ago after the IPCC, the  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:31):**  British Governmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2018. You know, we know that the  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:35):**  IPCC has an inherent conservatism to it. And actually what they talk about publicly is  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:40):**  probably worse in reality. But that report, I think, and certainly for me personally,  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:44):**  as someone who had worked as a sort of campaigner and consultant and activist for the best part  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:49):**  of two decades was like, oh, that really brought me to my knees and went...  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:52):**  I mean, just, just in defense of these 10 year, 10 years to save the planet, the science  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:18:57):**  is all true. So had we, when we were launching, you know, a hundred months or whatever, was  
**[0:19:02-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:02):**  it Andrew Sims' 100 months report campaign back in the day, right? That's true, right?  
**[0:19:06-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:06):**  Had we managed to hit B commissions by then and then to be coming down there, we would  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:10):**  not be in the same trajectory that we're on now for three to four degrees, right? So,  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:14):**  so we are, I think, I think it's just like, they're ways of engaging.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:18):**  Yeah, and they're supposed to sharpen...  
**[0:19:20-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:20):**  I do agree with Ed on the fact we're now in a disruption. There's a great book, which  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:24):**  really influenced me for about, I guess, 2008 or nine, maybe something like that, by Paul  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:29):**  Gilding, who was actually at Greenpeace Australia called The Great Disruption. And what he wrote  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:33):**  largely is playing out now, which is, you know, you get to this point where suddenly  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:37):**  humanity decides to deal with this issue and at the point it starts to deal with this issue,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:41):**  then it becomes the goal of society. Once it becomes the goal of society, then it becomes  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:45):**  the use of profit and it becomes the generate for why you do it. You know, in some ways,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:50):**  if you take the idea of safety, you know, not having knife crime has been a goal in  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:54):**  society, right? So we sort of think it's okay in a business, obviously you can't go around  
**[0:19:57-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:19:57):**  encouraging people to do knife crime because that's a bad thing to do. If the goal becomes  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:00):**  being sustainable as a society, then the disruption to the business model is more followed.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:04):**  Okay. Okay. So the world outside is changing. We can see that there is this disruption that's  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:09):**  already underway. Companies are starting to listen. They're starting to wake up. And as  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:13):**  I look, look around, you look around a supermarket or look around, you know, online shops, you  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:18):**  know, I can see that. And it seems these days as though you can hardly move actually for  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:23):**  the green claims that are coming out from one company or another. And so as customers,  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:28):**  as citizens of a planet in crisis, I wonder how we can tell the difference Bennett between  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:33):**  a company that's genuinely delivering change, delivering sustainability in its supply chains  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:38):**  and a company that's just talking the talk and painting a green glass over business as  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:42):**  usual to try and drive its sales. How can I tell the difference as a consumer?  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:46):**  So the first thing I say is I think I have a slight nervousness about all consumer behavior  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:51):**  change type work and campaigning because I'm just not convinced it works. I think we need  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:55):**  more systemic change. That said, I think it's, it's, and I think we are seeing elements of  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:20:59):**  this coming toward, it's a combination of appropriate regulation. Okay. And then the  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:04):**  role of civil society to help galvanize pressure. So on the, on the regulation side, I mean,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:08):**  I think you have to look at some of the ways that mandatory disclosures in formal corporate  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:15):**  reporting driving a transparency about corporate behavior. That's the first one. So the modern  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:19):**  slavery act, you know, actually really important TCFDs. I mean, they're probably not ambitious  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:25):**  enough in terms of what you can disclose, but sorry, the task force on climate related  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:29):**  financial disclosures, which mandates reporting on the level of risk your business faces in  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:36):**  the face of climate change and global heating. And so that sense of mandrically describing  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:41):**  what would happen to your company in a one and a half degree scenario and a two degree  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:45):**  scenario and a four degree scenario. What that mean for your business? What that does  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:48):**  is allows company makes companies, but the data out there, which then allows civil society  
**[0:21:53-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:21:53):**  to galvanize that data and score it. So if you look at FMCG and retail, the work that  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:00):**  Oxfam have done on behind the brands and then behind the barcodes as two campaigns, I think  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:04):**  is absolutely brilliant. Similarly important because they've taken a lot of that publicly  
**[0:22:08-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:08):**  disclosed data and that stuff that's been reported and they've used that to pull together  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:12):**  their scorecards to then put pressure onto corporates for change. And the last thing  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:16):**  I'll say is it's absolutely true. You're sitting at your desk and suddenly, you know, 50,000  
**[0:22:21-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:21):**  emails for a group piece arrive in the managing director's inbox. Certainly someone in my  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:25):**  position slightly smiles and goes, oh good, fine. Yes, good, fine. Now we can go and do  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:29):**  this because it does create some space and it does create some pressure because senior  
**[0:22:33-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:33):**  executives are humans too, right? They're all humans and they have feelings and emotions  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:37):**  and they don't like to think that they're doing the bad thing.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:39):**  You make it sound as though chief executives are kind of just waiting for those emails  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:43):**  to come in in order to make the change. I think often they are, you know, I think often,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:48):**  you know, you've got to remember that organizations are large and complicated and there is only  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:52):**  so much bandwidth that chief executives can use of where they set priorities and how they  
**[0:22:56-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:22:56):**  can drive change in the list of priorities they've got, how many things they need to  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:00):**  get through. And I think often that actually quietly is a bit of a, okay, actually this  
**[0:23:05-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:05):**  does help me get that done in a way. So there's a degree to which having that ability  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:08):**  to demonstrate that this is of interest to the public because there are 50,000 emails  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:12):**  that are telling you it's of interest to the public is helpful.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:15):**  Exactly. Interesting. And I wonder this whole issue  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:17):**  of actual sustainability in the supply chain or greenwash, I wonder if there's a degree  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:22):**  to which we can look at greenwash in a slightly different way. And at least there is a recognition  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:26):**  from a company that there is a public desire for greater responsibility. And I wonder whether  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:31):**  greenwash, annoying as it may be, may actually just be a first step towards trying to get  
**[0:23:36-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:36):**  a more honest and genuine embedding of sustainability. Yeah. I mean, I mean, it echoes what the point  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:41):**  that Bennett was making about, you know, people genuinely wanting to do the right thing, you  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:45):**  know, and I think mercifully we do have some, obviously some rather Machiavellian corporate  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:50):**  behavior, but I think broadly, you know, most people are trying to be responsible and there  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:23:56):**  are some instances of greenwash which are a little bit painful, but I think most tend  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:01):**  to be down to kind of rather over enthusiastic and overexcited PR and marketing and comms  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:07):**  teams who go, oh, we've done something or the company's just done something, let's go  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:11):**  out there and really shout about it. And so I think sometimes they could just get a bit  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:15):**  carried away and not appreciate the fact that there hasn't actually really been a substantive  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:20):**  or systemic shift in the organization. But the point you're making, Fionn-Lo, is like  
**[0:24:24-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:24):**  there is an appetite from the customer. I hesitate to use the word consumer. John Alexander  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:28):**  from the New Citizenship Project puts it best. He said, you know, when you prime people as  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:32):**  citizens they become much more altruistic. Looking at the bigger picture, broader context,  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:37):**  if you prime them psychologically as consumers then it's all about their own rights. So it  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:42):**  does actually make us more selfish. But the point is, you know, there is an appetite out  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:46):**  there, which is why companies are orienting this. I was talking to, you know, John Richardson,  
**[0:24:50-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:50):**  the comedian who I do the future talks with, and he said, you know, he gets invited to  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:54):**  do a lot of adverts and voiceovers and those kind of things, he turns most of them down.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:24:58):**  But he said all of the ones he's getting at the moment are for some kind of green, responsible  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:02):**  or ethical product or service. You know, he said, you know, even just the stuff that's  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:07):**  coming from his agent has a particular tone and flavor to it. And that suggests, again,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:13):**  as Bennett said, you know, there is a sort of sustainability shift going on, the economy  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:16):**  is beginning to re-engineer itself. And clearly people want to play to that emerging opportunity.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:22):**  When you talk about, you know, a PR company that gets excited, I wonder in your experience,  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:27):**  Ed, what usually happens? Is it usually the case that the PR company has got excited and  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:32):**  therefore the company thinks, oh, oh gosh, I'd better shift in order to make sure that  
**[0:25:38-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:38):**  we're delivering what the PR company has been talking about? Or is it actually that there's  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:41):**  there's kind of pushback and there's a bit of a slap on the wrist for the PR company?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:45):**  Is there a rule of thumb?  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:46):**  No, there's a bit of both. I would say in my experience as a consultant, you know, the  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:50):**  client would often come to us and say, we want to talk about our sustainability strategy.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:55):**  And then we'd look at their sustainability strategy and go, the strategy is awful. You  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:25:59):**  need to go and do something that's worth talking about. So inevitably, we became a sort of  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:04):**  strategy and creative agency. It was like going, well, let's fix the strategy. So there's  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:07):**  actually something authentic, credible, and transformative going on here. And then you've  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:13):**  got a legitimate reason to go out and engage your customers. And I don't think that's always  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:17):**  the case, unfortunately, I think the very nature of the way that piecemeal PR tends  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:22):**  to work, it's like, what little aspect can we really amplify here? And what can we shout  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:26):**  about? And unfortunately, that can then be used in a quite misrepresentative way, which  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:31):**  seduces the customer, unfortunately, to think that a lot more is going on than actually  
**[0:26:36-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:36):**  is because the other point you made, Findo, about, you know, people in the supermarket  
**[0:26:40-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:40):**  aisle. I mean, you know, people are not necessarily lazy, but they're busy. And it's exhausting  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:45):**  and overwhelming to try and understand what's going on. You know, in a way, this is where  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:50):**  the great shifts like Mark Suspense's plan A we're trying to go just to say, look, when  
**[0:26:55-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:55):**  you walk through the door of M&S, we've tried to sort out a lot of that stuff for you, you  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:26:59):**  know, the environment and the ethics and the responsibility. We're trying to make sure  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:03):**  that and Waitrose and John Lewis are similar. It's like, you know, we are a credible, responsible  
**[0:27:07-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:07):**  brand. So you don't have to worry about making decisions inside our shops, because we're  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:13):**  trying to look after that holistically. I think it's difficult, because especially with  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:17):**  online shopping, perhaps this is sharper as well, it's like, cost and convenience still  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:22):**  triumph a lot. And if you can make the responsible proposition simple, and cost comparable, you  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:29):**  know, so whether that's turning your whole shopping to the responsible brand, or it's  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:35):**  just saying, you know, you can have something here, which won't cost you any more. And it's  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:40):**  a straight shift or swap for you, but actually will have huge implications in the supply  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:44):**  chain and the people who work in it, etc, etc. And for the environment and biodiversity,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:48):**  that people will take that because people aren't stupid. But the trouble is, it's complex,  
**[0:27:53-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:53):**  it's hard, and people don't get the information in a way which is digestible, which enables  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:27:58):**  them to make the empowered decisions.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:00):**  I want to move on a little now from companies and onto politics. Ben, you're the Deputy  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:04):**  Chair of the Conservative Environment Network. And so I want to take advantage of having  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:09):**  you here and talk a little bit about climate change and the centre-right. Because even  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:13):**  just a few years ago, and I'm thinking back to say 2014-15, climate change denial was  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:18):**  rife across the UK Conservative Party, MPs and councillors. And now that's changed. The  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:24):**  debate over whether climate change exists has disappeared. It's no longer party political,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:28):**  and we're now in a much more interesting and urgent discussion around what on earth we  
**[0:28:32-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:32):**  actually do about it. But this change hasn't happened in the United States, in the Republican  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:37):**  Party. It hasn't happened in the National Party of Australia. So what's different about  
**[0:28:41-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:41):**  the UK?  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:42):**  Right. What do you mean by rife? Was there lots of it? Yes. Was it everywhere? No. And  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:47):**  it never was. And I think it's really important in the Tory party to sort of understand the  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:50):**  history that it comes from. And I think it's very easy to forget that it was Michael Howard,  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:55):**  who was the Secretary of State for the Environment, who signed us up at the Rio Earth Summit in  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:28:59):**  1992.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:00):**  So, let me define rife. Let me define it because you've asked me to. So back in 2014, if I  
**[0:29:05-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:05):**  was sort of talking to Conservative MPs, I can think of about five that were prepared  
**[0:29:08-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:08):**  to stand up and say that climate change was a clear and present danger. And the others,  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:12):**  whether they actually deny climate change or not, just kept their heads down because  
**[0:29:16-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:16):**  it was too much of a political football.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:17):**  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, I think that's certainly right. So the politics of it. But  
**[0:29:21-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:21):**  I just think it's important to recognise the Tory Party. There is quite a long standing  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:24):**  tradition. And one of the things, you know, when we set up this story, no one remembers  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:29):**  about this formation of set. It was set up in the Greenpeace garden when I was at Greenpeace  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:34):**  back in the day, because I got some friends around, we said, no, we need to, some other  
**[0:29:38-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:38):**  great people who did it. And over the years, we've iterated it. And now it's brilliantly  
**[0:29:41-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:41):**  led by Ben Goldsmith. So that the roots of the Conservative environment, I would actually  
**[0:29:44-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:44):**  start with Greenpeace. It's not a very well known fact. But I do think there is still  
**[0:29:49-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:49):**  this tradition that has gone all the way through it. And I think the reason why you have more  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:29:56):**  councillors and MPs prepared to stand up and to take their lead is I think I would say  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:00):**  in the UK party, twofold. One, I humbly would suggest that actually the work the Conservative  
**[0:30:05-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:05):**  Environment Network has done over the years has been really about building safe spaces  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:09):**  for these people to be able to walk into to have these conversations. That's really what  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:13):**  we did is we created lots of most of the Conservative Environment Network's work happens behind  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:19):**  the scenes. It's about having private meetings, private discussions, bringing people together  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:23):**  with, you know, senior intellectuals and academics, and putting them in rooms where they can have  
**[0:30:29-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:29):**  discussions and walk forward and feel confidence to talk about it as it goes through. I think  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:33):**  secondly, you know, maybe this is a bit of criminology going on here. But I do think  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:37):**  the way the climate skeptics have played the argument has changed in different territories.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:40):**  And so they have the sort of easy clip, it's not happening answer. The climate skeptics  
**[0:30:45-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:45):**  have sort of given up trying to push that line. And you see Steve Baker's intervention  
**[0:30:49-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:49):**  from the Global Warning Policy Foundation the other day, where he was talking about  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:53):**  the hidden costs of net zero. So he's moved off that climate change isn't happening into  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:30:57):**  oh, this is all too expensive, or we can't do anything, you know, the market should clear.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:01):**  So the debate has shifted. So a lot of those voices who are coming basically from a kind  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:05):**  of libertarian sense that environmentalists are somehow conflicted with their ideology  
**[0:31:10-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:10):**  are being given another route out of it in terms of talking about market economics will  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:14):**  deliver environmental outcomes on their own without the need for any government intervention  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:18):**  whatsoever or change. That's where a lot of that libertarian debate, which has taken heat  
**[0:31:22-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:22):**  out of the principles of going to net zero, because they are largely out of that, but  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:26):**  it takes it I think potentially into more dangerous places, but we don't need to do  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:29):**  anything or tax anyone or change any of our policies or our regulations. And we just carry  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:33):**  on because the market will now clear. And I think in Australia and America, I think  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:38):**  frankly, the climate skeptics haven't moved on in the same way. And so they're still creating  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:42):**  that space of denialism that exists within there. I largely think it doesn't matter,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:46):**  because I said I'll go back to where we started this conversation. I think the disruption  
**[0:31:49-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:49):**  is underway now. The shifts are happening. The generational shifts and changes are happening.  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:53):**  That will sort of speed this up. So the idea we're going to have a Prime Minister in the  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:31:57):**  UK or frankly even presidential candidates again in the States who don't sign up to this,  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:03):**  I think is increasingly a receiving prospect.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:05):**  So essentially, the libertarian right has sort of given up on trying to disprove the  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:10):**  science and they've also moved on to a conversation about policy as well, which can only be helpful  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:16):**  within the Conservative Party and right wing movements, because you're able to have that  
**[0:32:20-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:20):**  discussion about what is the centre-right way of doing things, what is the libertarian  
**[0:32:24-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:24):**  way of doing things and then find your own route.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:26):**  Welcome to our territory, right? That's right. Come and fight on our territory. That's right.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:29):**  We can have that discussion all day long. So I mean, it's a delaying strategy, I think  
**[0:32:34-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:34):**  is all they've got now. I don't think they're in a stopping it strategy. I think they'll  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:37):**  just delay it as much as possible. I suspect in their quiet moments they know they've lost.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:41):**  But we'll see in the States. But I mean, even for all the rhetoric, I think it's important  
**[0:32:45-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:45):**  to keep this in perspective as environmentalists. And we've fought this for so long, it's very  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:48):**  easy to forget that we were not fighting the battles of 10 or 15 years ago now, right?  
**[0:32:52-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:52):**  That we've moved on to a different phase of this. Even Trump, for all his rhetoric, more  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:32:56):**  coal-fired power stations closed than open-minded has watched, right? There's stuff happening  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:00):**  behind the scenes that is more fundamentally different. And it's important, I think, that  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:04):**  as environmentalists, we don't just keep fighting yesterday's battles, we move forward into  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:08):**  the next. And I will welcome somebody in, even if five years ago they were saying this  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:12):**  is all climate denialism, I'll welcome them into a Sen meeting and say, fantastic, sit  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:16):**  down, welcome, you know, because we now need everybody involved, irrespective of the past.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:21):**  I'm interested in, there are two organisations in Britain that are kind of diametrically  
**[0:33:25-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:25):**  opposed to each other in many ways in terms of their approach. And you just talked about  
**[0:33:28-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:28):**  Sen, the Conservative Environment Network, and the way that most of your work is very  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:32):**  quiet and behind closed doors. And then there's Extinction Rebellion, which is loud and exuberant  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:37):**  and uses a lot of superglue. And I wanted to ask you about Extinction Rebellion. XR  
**[0:33:42-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:42):**  has pushed climate action up the agenda recently, but I wonder if you think that there is a  
**[0:33:47-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:47):**  danger that in just attacking the government, as many NGOs tend to do, for not doing enough,  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:53):**  rather than acknowledging at least some of the UK's progress, and by linking climate  
**[0:33:57-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:33:57):**  action again to economic reform and a more socialist model of economics, that XR may  
**[0:34:02-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:02):**  actually reignite that tired old political division and slow down real progress toward  
**[0:34:08-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:08):**  net zero warming? I mean, XR, I mean, you know, let's start.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:12):**  The awareness raising and the power of the campaign really starts with Greta Thunberg  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:16):**  and that bit is of course hugely powerful and immensely welcome. You do need a movement  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:21):**  with any question that just says truth's power, which is, you know, this is a kind of emergency,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:25):**  let's treat it like a climate emergency, and let's respond quickly for it. That said, I  
**[0:34:30-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:30):**  do think some of XR's campaigning style is unfortunate. A true story, in the 2017 general  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:39):**  election, there was an XR demonstration outside the Labour Party headquarters on Victoria  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:43):**  Street, okay, and there was a lady who was on hunger strike outside the Labour Party  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:47):**  headquarters, right? Now, Jeremy Corbyn was the leader of the Labour Party at the time  
**[0:34:50-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:50):**  and he was literally campaigning for the XR manifesto. That was literally being written  
**[0:34:55-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:55):**  into the Labour Party manifesto, but they were campaigning outside the Labour Party.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:34:58):**  And you saw one go, really? I mean, really? So, I think some of their campaigning styles,  
**[0:35:04-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:04):**  it does, it kind of, if you're not, I think, intelligent when you're campaigning and have  
**[0:35:08-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:08):**  a clear point of change that you're looking for and a clear point of intervention and  
**[0:35:12-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:12):**  an effect on the results of your campaign you're looking for, then I think it too easily  
**[0:35:16-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:16):**  gets played into the narrative of there are nothing ever good enough for these people  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:19):**  and that's why, therefore, I should do nothing. What do you think, Ed? What do you think,  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:23):**  Ed? I get the impression that you're more sympathetic, I guess, to the way that XR does  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:28):**  things. Again, there's a sort of grizzled campaign  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:32):**  in myself and I mean, I've been involved with XR. I would say that what XR did, and I take  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:38):**  Bennett's point about, you know, some of the specific actions were perhaps not so well  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:42):**  thought through, but that's also the problem you have when you have a sort of decentralised  
**[0:35:46-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:46):**  movement, which isn't, you know, quite the same command and control structure as you  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:50):**  might have in a more conventional campaigning type model. And so you're going to have things  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:35:55):**  that happen, which aren't always necessarily aligned or was indeed 100% helpful. But for  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:00):**  me, what Extinction Rebellion did was create a radical flank, which did open up a huge  
**[0:36:06-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:06):**  amount of middle ground. And of course, there'll be some people in alienated by that, but I  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:10):**  actually think it turned silence into speech in a way that it got the country talking.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:15):**  And it created a debate, which I think ultimately has been one of the most effective interventions  
**[0:36:20-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:20):**  from civil society in the last 10 years or so. And so I think, you know, it remains to  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:26):**  be seen where XR goes next, but I think there's lots of creative space, which has now been  
**[0:36:31-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:31):**  occupied in a really effective way by Greta, by the school strikes, by people waking up  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:39):**  to what can feel like, and I mean this apolitically, but a degree of political dishonesty across  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:45):**  the board that, you know, somehow we can write a net zero target and that everything will  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:50):**  be delivered painlessly and without cost. And actually our lives won't change. And I  
**[0:36:54-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:54):**  think that is politically dishonest. And again, it comes back to this courage point that I  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:36:59):**  keep returning to. It's like, where will be the leaders that will say, this is not going  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:03):**  to be easy. You know, this is not about just powering the UK's domestic electricity from  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:09):**  offshore wind. This is going to mean some degree of demand management. This is going  
**[0:37:13-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:13):**  to mean the fact that, you know, we have a problem in the UK with say frequent flyers.  
**[0:37:19-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:19):**  You know, the majority of our flights are taken by a very small chunk of the population.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:23):**  And we can make that very populist and very equitable and fair by saying, well, actually,  
**[0:37:29-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:29):**  if you're flying 10 or 12 times a year, you should be paying a disproportionate price  
**[0:37:33-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:33):**  to the person who will fly once on holiday with their family for their hard earned break.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:37):**  And so I think that there is a political dishonesty right now where we feel, again, this slight  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:42):**  seduction of the high level targets, which gives people a sense that everything's going  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:47):**  on and that we're sort of on track. But at the same time, it's like, and it's business  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:52):**  as usual below the radar. And it's like, that's not the case. And we've got to, we've got  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:37:56):**  to be clear and honest with people that this is a transition and a transformation and there  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:01):**  will be, you know, winners, losers, checks and balances, profit and loss.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:04):**  One of the key messages from Extinction Rebellion is that going vegan is the best way to save  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:09):**  the planet, which some NGOs have taken on and they've reframed as a 50% cut in meat  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:14):**  and dairy products by 2030, which is, you know, just eight and a half years time. Now,  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:19):**  when we spoke recently, you said something, Ed, that I thought was much more interesting  
**[0:38:24-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:24):**  and much more interesting framing that rather than cutting 50% of the meat and dairy out  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:29):**  of our diets, we all need to cut 50% of the carbon out of our diets by 2030. What's the  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:35):**  difference?  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:36):**  Well, I mean, I think this comes back to the point I was making earlier about, you know,  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:38):**  clear, simple campaigning messages, which are now perhaps missing some of the nuance  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:42):**  and complexity of the reality. I mean, I would far rather see it as a choice for people and  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:47):**  an informed choice and an emergent sense of change, because clearly there are aspects  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:52):**  of livestock agriculture which can be quite regenerative. Whilst there is a broad truth  
**[0:38:58-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:38:58):**  to perhaps that going towards veganism, even if it's not vegan every day, will likely have  
**[0:39:04-0:39:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:04):**  a big benefit. Clearly, it would be nice to give people a bit more subtlety, you know,  
**[0:39:09-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:09):**  clearly we're in the space beyond, you know, just meatless or meat-free Mondays. And what  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:13):**  you would want to see is people being very smart and judicious about where they choose  
**[0:39:18-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:18):**  to get their different sources of protein from. Because I think there's also a food  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:22):**  security issue there, isn't there? You know, where we're only sort of 60% food self-sufficient  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:27):**  in the UK. I would far rather see us having a much bigger national debate, which again,  
**[0:39:32-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:32):**  I think there's been a little bit of political cowardice around. It was just saying, well,  
**[0:39:36-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:36):**  what does a sustainable diet look like for the nation? And it's not saying we go back  
**[0:39:39-0:39:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:39):**  to a sort of 1940s rationing food security type of imposition, but it's to say, this  
**[0:39:45-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:45):**  is what we can produce in the UK in a sustainable and regenerative fashion to bring our soils  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:50):**  back to health, to have the right type of biodiversity. And this is the implications  
**[0:39:55-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:55):**  that it then has for the nation's diet. And one of my favourite examples, if we're talking  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:39:59):**  about land and agricultural production is, you know, back here in East Anglia is Hodmer  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:04):**  Dobs, you know, a local company which are doing some amazing work with bringing back  
**[0:40:08-0:40:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:08):**  all these different types of pulses and beans and even growing quinoa in Essex. You know,  
**[0:40:13-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:13):**  and these are really sustainable, great sources of protein, which can be grown in an organic  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:18):**  and soil friendly way. And that's a really fantastic protein displacement, you know,  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:23):**  some of the cheap meat. I mean, heaven forbid, you know, the latest trade deal with Australia  
**[0:40:28-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:28):**  where we're going to get, you know, some pretty low welfare meat coming halfway around the  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:33):**  planet to disrupt our own agricultural markets. And it's like, that seems to be some pretty  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:39):**  piss poor political decision making.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:42):**  The other factor in all of the diet questions, people have been trying to do this, and the  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:45):**  work of Professor Tim Lang, he's been looking at sustainable diets and how you can do this  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:49):**  is really interesting. I agree a bit more political risk needs to be taken about what  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:52):**  that means. And the links, we say it's entity, the links to health, well being and that,  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:40:57):**  and I think that's going to be a key area for change. But also, frankly, that again,  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:01):**  come back to what I call nature positive innovation, you know, the truth of the matter is the food  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:05):**  system is going to go into the growth of its own massive disruption, because, you know,  
**[0:41:09-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:09):**  I don't know if you think it's not about recreating the, you know, the alternative proteins, yes,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:13):**  we need to bring back original varieties and that sort of thing. But we're also going to  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:17):**  be able to generate proteins that look and taste awfully like animal proteins a long  
**[0:41:21-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:21):**  time before we create the perfect steak. And so a lot of that protein and a lot of dairy  
**[0:41:25-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:25):**  is going to get disrupted. A lot of you know, so we'll have cows to generate really high  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:29):**  quality milk, like really high quality cheese, but you know, the milk that goes into my tea  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:34):**  could well come from it, might well not come from a cow's milk.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:38):**  I totally agree Ben, I mean, I call it like handicraft and spacecraft, you know, there'll  
**[0:41:42-0:41:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:42):**  be that precision fermentation piece, which provides some of it and then there'll be the  
**[0:41:46-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:46):**  stuff which actually reestablishes that relationship with the land again as well. Because I think  
**[0:41:50-0:41:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:50):**  that's the other thing that could happen if you get into this sort of slightly industrialised  
**[0:41:55-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:55):**  innovation, which has also huge benefits for animal welfare, but you don't want to become  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:41:59):**  disconnected from the soil completely because you know, that still is ultimately the stuff  
**[0:42:03-0:42:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:03):**  of life.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:04):**  I want to go back to this idea of nuance and the idea that nuance is anathema to campaigning.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:10):**  And it seems to me that there is a great danger, Bennett, in oversimplifying these environmental  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:16):**  challenges, whether it's governments or companies. And earlier on, I highlighted the fallacy  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:20):**  of the duty to maximise profit. And I wonder if companies and governments are falling into  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:25):**  a similar trap when it comes to climate change, land use and the countryside. And in following  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:30):**  this perceived duty to maximise emissions reduction, because that's, you know, that's  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:34):**  the big thing that everybody's focused on at the moment, that these decisions are being  
**[0:42:38-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:38):**  taken and they undermine biodiversity restoration, they can undermine climate change adaptation  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:44):**  and rural innovation, job creation, food quality, all these other things. And that instead,  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:49):**  surely our duty to the countryside isn't just about prioritising emissions reduction, but  
**[0:42:55-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:55):**  instead it's about delivering multiple outcomes from land use wherever possible, all at the  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:42:59):**  same time. And clearly we need leadership around this to get, you know, through the  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:03):**  nuance, to cope with the fact that it's not an easy political message and get this across  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:08):**  to people. Do you think the government gets this?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:10):**  Yes, I think they do. I think the policy, well, government, I think government is not  
**[0:43:14-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:14):**  one homogenous sort of blob that everybody in government all just signs up to the set  
**[0:43:19-0:43:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:19):**  views. I think the guys working on the policy on this in Defra do get this very much so,  
**[0:43:23-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:23):**  yes, I'm sure they do. There does still seem to be quite a strong  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:26):**  drive towards, you know, sparing off large tracts of land for sitka spruce just for that  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:32):**  carbon sequestration, which, you know, can have some really pretty devastating impacts  
**[0:43:35-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:35):**  on biodiversity and flooding and that sort of thing.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:37):**  Yeah, no, for sure. And I think I wouldn't, I wouldn't disagree that not every decision  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:41):**  that's being made is therefore the right decision, but do they get this? And I think you're seeing  
**[0:43:45-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:45):**  some of this in the fact that they're taking a while to work out the right incentive mechanisms  
**[0:43:49-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:49):**  to replace CAP with, right? So what does ELM look like? The environmental  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:54):**  land management scheme that will replace the CAP farming subsidies. You know, they've got  
**[0:43:58-0:44:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:43:58):**  their initial pilots, the sustainable farming incentive, they've got this initial pilots  
**[0:44:03-0:44:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:03):**  at the moment, which are very much looking at this and how do you balance it and how  
**[0:44:06-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:06):**  do you measure it? And how do you know whether you're getting the net biodiversity gain from  
**[0:44:10-0:44:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:10):**  particular behaviours? And how do you then run that at scale when every single ecosystem  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:15):**  is different? But the whole point about nature is it's different in every value, right? That's  
**[0:44:19-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:19):**  the point. And so how on earth do you design schemes that do this and push it? So it's  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:23):**  at scale when actually the data points are different everywhere you look. I think the  
**[0:44:27-0:44:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:27):**  answers aren't immediately obvious for this. I think there are no question there are going  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:30):**  to be bad actors as well who are pushing, you know, there are going to be elements in  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:34):**  the commercial forestry community who are without doubt seeing this as an opportunity  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:38):**  to get paid to do commercial forestry, which is not necessarily with long term environmental  
**[0:44:43-0:44:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:43):**  outcomes. You know, we need to recognise that our role, to come back to my point, we need  
**[0:44:47-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:47):**  to recognise that our environmentalist change here, we need to facilitate and enable these  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:51):**  debates to take place, I think, as opposed to just constantly beating people up who are  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:55):**  trying to do it. You know, we need to the net zero debate, you already alluded to, is  
**[0:44:59-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:44:59):**  hugely important right now. You know, we can't just pretend we can buy our way out of, you  
**[0:45:05-0:45:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:05):**  know, buying endless carbon credits for a bunch of Christmas trees, right? So that's  
**[0:45:09-0:45:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:09):**  not going to achieve anything. It's how do we actually understand how, as one of my bosses  
**[0:45:14-0:45:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:14):**  would have called it, how we actually live in harmony with nature, right? How do we live  
**[0:45:17-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:17):**  in harmony with the natural world? And have that sort of more self-sustaining lifestyle  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:22):**  of it. I think it's naive to think it's just going to be a simple back to the land approach  
**[0:45:26-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:26):**  that just works on its own, because we're going to need to blend because there are,  
**[0:45:29-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:29):**  you know, many, many people on this planet and there's lots of people, as was this test,  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:34):**  you know, environmentalism has to work for the most vulnerable rural community. It also  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:38):**  has to work for somebody on minimum wage with two jobs in Heclim, right? And you've got  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:42):**  to, it's got to work in all angles. So we need to understand what those parameters are.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:46):**  Jason Vale There's a lot of pressure and a lot of grumbling  
**[0:45:48-0:45:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:48):**  from farmers about the fact that there isn't an immediate replacement to the Common Agricultural  
**[0:45:53-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:53):**  Policy, you know, at this point. And as you say, elms are being thought about up until,  
**[0:45:58-0:46:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:45:58):**  you know, 2024 when the new scheme will be in place. But it's always seemed to me, and  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:02):**  what you're saying seems to be backing this up, that actually, it's really important that  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:06):**  government can take the time to go through these trials, so that it doesn't just implement  
**[0:46:11-0:46:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:11):**  something, which a year later, they realised was actually pointing things, pushing things  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:15):**  in completely the wrong direction. So having these two or three, four even years to get  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:20):**  stuff right, we should kind of take some solace from that.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:23):**  David Pembroke We've got to understand how the rural communities  
**[0:46:26-0:46:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:26):**  and the jobs that currently exist, but in particular ways that the countryside is managed,  
**[0:46:31-0:46:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:31):**  how that iterates, how do we ensure that it continues, there continues to be jobs and  
**[0:46:36-0:46:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:36):**  roles and vibrant opportunities for rural communities in this space. And we can't just  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:42):**  sledgehammer from one to the other and then discover we've got a problem because it won't  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:45):**  last, that the politics will go against us. And I think we do need a kind of innovation  
**[0:46:49-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:49):**  and iterative innovation culture through this whole agenda. So we can let people sort of,  
**[0:46:53-0:46:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:53):**  you know, we can need to experiment, we can give people the space to experiment.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:56):**  Jason Vale Ed, one of the conclusions from a previous  
**[0:46:58-0:47:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:46:58):**  podcast conversation with Cristiano Figueres and Professor Tim Jackson was that in terms  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:03):**  of food, land use decisions are too often profit led, and they're being taken by people  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:08):**  who are just too far removed from the land and the communities that they impact. And  
**[0:47:13-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:13):**  that instead, sustainable land use requires a power shift from large food corporations  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:18):**  and back towards small and medium sized farm and food businesses. What do you think?  
**[0:47:23-0:47:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:23):**  Tim Jackson Yes. I mean, everything that Bennett's just  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:28):**  eloquently articulated around, you know, some of the right legislative incentives and measurement  
**[0:47:33-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:33):**  schemes and experimentation that's going to go on. But I think broadly, you know, you  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:37):**  have got to bring people back into that intimate, rather emotional, harmonious stewardship of  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:42):**  the land. I mean, I look around the fields here in East Anglia, and there's so many farms  
**[0:47:48-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:48):**  that have been put out to contractors for cultivation, where you get these big, slightly  
**[0:47:53-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:53):**  faceless contract organizations, they have no relationship with the land that they operate  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:47:58):**  on. You know, you probably got reasonably poorly paid people actually operating the  
**[0:48:03-0:48:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:03):**  machinery. I don't sense, you know, and I hesitate to use the word love, but they don't love  
**[0:48:08-0:48:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:08):**  the land that they're looking after. You know, it is unfortunately being seen through an  
**[0:48:13-0:48:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:13):**  economic and a profit led lens. And that's different because, again, I think coming back  
**[0:48:18-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:18):**  to most people being, you know, generally well intentioned, I mean, farmers care about  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:23):**  their land and hopefully can be incentivized and nurtured and cajoled and supported in  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:28):**  trying to do the right thing. And I don't think that happens in quite the same way,  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:33):**  even under the best intentioned commercial contractors. And so, you know, you want someone  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:39):**  who gives them monkeys about what's in their hedgerows, that is what is in the bits of  
**[0:48:43-0:48:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:43):**  land between the bits that they're cultivating at the time, that understands the role of  
**[0:48:48-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:48):**  set aside and actually takes a real joy and pleasure and pride and honor in facilitating  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:55):**  that harmonious relationship with nature, because that's what farming is about. And  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:48:59):**  that's what it should be about. And its deepest roots are there. And if we circle back to  
**[0:49:04-0:49:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:04):**  some of the issues around greenwash, which use the word farm, you know, to cultivate  
**[0:49:10-0:49:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:10):**  an image in people's minds that is actually not very representative of the reality of  
**[0:49:15-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:15):**  agribusiness and is evocative. But yeah, I do think we want to have this a renaissance  
**[0:49:22-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:22):**  of what it means to be a genuine ecological steward that provides food for the nation  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:29):**  and protects and enhances the nation's wildlife at the same time.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:33):**  Bennett, just finally, I wonder if I could ask you about, and I appreciate it's difficult  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:38):**  to sum up, you know, what a conservative view is, but at the same time, you know, as somebody  
**[0:49:43-0:49:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:43):**  from within the conservative movement, as a center right person, what's your view about  
**[0:49:48-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:48):**  where power and profit should sit in the future in terms of food production and agricultural  
**[0:49:53-0:50:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:49:53):**  land use? Is it about linear top-down change led by big business, big profits, and perhaps  
**[0:50:00-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:00):**  big investment in change? Or is it about a bottom-up revolution of smaller businesses  
**[0:50:05-0:50:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:05):**  in a more diverse and vibrant rural economy with profits recycling around those countryside  
**[0:50:11-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:11):**  communities?  
**[0:50:12-0:50:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:12):**  Yeah, I mean, I have to say over the last five years, I don't know how much I would  
**[0:50:14-0:50:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:14):**  describe myself as a conservative these days. It's been a journey, right? But we will see.  
**[0:50:23-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:23):**  Look, I think the, of course, it's the latter, right? Of course it is. Of course, it's, you  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:28):**  know, at the heart of any sort of, in the UK at least, conservative tradition is Burke,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:34):**  right? It's all about a kind of sense of, yes, how do you encompass that sort of free  
**[0:50:39-0:50:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:39):**  and enable the small business, the community, the town to be in control of its destiny and  
**[0:50:46-0:50:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:46):**  make its choices. As ever where nothing is bifurcated, of course, that's where your starting  
**[0:50:50-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:50):**  point is. But of course, it's going to have to be some national enablers of that to get  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:50:54):**  that through. You're going to have to see some work on whether it's around food standards,  
**[0:51:00-0:51:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:00):**  and how do you build sustainability criteria into understanding some of our food standards  
**[0:51:04-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:04):**  and that sort of thing. How do you build in? What are the rules, frankly, on sort of say,  
**[0:51:09-0:51:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:09):**  I would applaud efforts to control the importation of unsustainable palm oil into the UK and  
**[0:51:17-0:51:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:17):**  that sort of thing. What are some of the rules, systemic rules that need to be put in place?  
**[0:51:21-0:51:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:21):**  It's a combination of both. In my heart, I would say, you need to have, as I say, we  
**[0:51:26-0:51:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:26):**  want to see a transition in the economy. That means everywhere is going to have to transition.  
**[0:51:31-0:51:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:31):**  And you've got to enable that, and that's going to be built by new innovations. The  
**[0:51:35-0:51:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:35):**  way I say it is, I think the kind of people who are going to win in this space, they probably  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:38):**  haven't dropped out of Harvard yet, the kind of businesses. They're kind of people who  
**[0:51:43-0:51:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:43):**  are going to get, who are going to really benefit from a sustainable future. Maybe they're  
**[0:51:46-0:51:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:46):**  dropping out if we speak, I don't know. There's a level of transition that we're going to  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:50):**  see over this next period that is super exciting. And it's how we try and minimise the inevitable  
**[0:51:55-0:51:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:55):**  negative consequences that will come from that.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/From-greed-to-green-e14mjr9#t=0:51:57):**  Fantastic. That's been so interesting, but that's all we've got time for. I'd like to

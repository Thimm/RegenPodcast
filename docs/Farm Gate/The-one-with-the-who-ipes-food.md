### Farm Gate  (Mon, 06 Jul 2020 13:53:46)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Costayne. Today I'm joined by two highly  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:10):**  distinguished guests who are here to discuss COVID-19 and the crisis in food systems. Dr.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:16):**  David Nabarro is Special Envoy of the World Health Organisation Director General on COVID-19  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:22):**  and Co-Director of the Imperial College Institute of Global Health Innovation at the Imperial  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:26):**  College London. Professor Melissa Leach CBE is the Director of the Institute of Development  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:32):**  Studies. She is a member of the Brussels-based International Panel of Experts on Sustainable  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:37):**  Food Systems, otherwise known as IPES Food, and was lead author on IPES Food's recent  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:43):**  special report looking into COVID-19 and the crisis in food systems. Welcome to you both.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:49):**  Melissa, IPES Food has linked the risk of zoonotic spillover with the need for more  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:00:54):**  resilient agroecological systems. And at the same time, David, you've said that the lockdown  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:00):**  is an important opportunity for people to pause and collectively make sense of the world  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:05):**  that we find ourselves in. What sense can we make of this pandemic and what lessons  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:11):**  should human beings be taking away, do you think? Melissa, perhaps you kick us off on  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:16):**  this. I think the pandemic has exposed some very big cracks in the systems that we all  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:21):**  depend on, those that are important to our health, to our economies, to our environments  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:26):**  and to food. And the crisis, therefore, is an opportunity for some quite fundamental  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:31):**  rethinks and resets. And as we've argued in the IPES Food report, a key area is our food  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:37):**  systems. And I think here we've known the problems that industrial food systems, the  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:42):**  dominant systems that we depend on around the world for a long time. There are severe  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:46):**  environmental problems. There are also problems of access and equity and of malnutrition and  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:51):**  health. And many of these have become extra visible through COVID-19. Whether we're talking  
**[0:01:57-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:01:57):**  about the zoonotic spillover, which I can elaborate on in a bit, but was at the root  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:01):**  of the initial outbreak, or through the health vulnerabilities that we've seen and the greater  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:07):**  infection rates that are seen amongst people with obesity and related conditions like diabetes,  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:14):**  or there are vulnerabilities in food supply in the context of lockdown and the way that  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:18):**  border closures have interrupted some of these very long carbon intensive food chains. And  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:24):**  so what we've argued with IPES Food is that agroecological systems, an alternative paradigm,  
**[0:02:30-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:30):**  if you like, actually offer ways forward to solve many of these issues. And the groups  
**[0:02:38-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:38):**  that have been practicing and arguing for agroecology for a long time, which includes  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:44):**  indigenous peoples, grassroots groups, those linking into the food sovereignty movement,  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:49):**  or indeed people doing their farming in ways that are much more rooted in relationships  
**[0:02:55-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:02:55):**  between agriculture and ecologies, linking food systems and society in more equitable  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:00):**  and resilient ways, actually now is an opportunity to say these are the kinds of systems we need.  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:06):**  And therefore, the cracks revealed by COVID to enable us to reset and reorientate and  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:11):**  really embrace this rather different paradigm into the future.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:15):**  So there's a better understanding of nature and our role within it as a species that exists  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:22):**  within rather than outside nature. David, I wonder if you could comment on that and  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:28):**  what sense you think in this context we should be taking from the pandemic.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:33):**  Thank you very much indeed. From my point of view, I sense a lot of things that are  
**[0:03:40-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:40):**  similar to those that are described by Melissa and it leads me to ask, well, as we develop  
**[0:03:47-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:47):**  new ways of thinking about food and food systems, how can we shift from that new mindset to  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:03:55):**  actually doing things differently? And this report, the IPES Food report, does actually  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:01):**  come out with a number of suggestions. And I think that what I'm now working on is how  
**[0:04:08-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:08):**  to build on those to actually get a collective effort or change. So I thought, number one,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:16):**  perhaps we need to get narratives that put people and nature more centrally within thinking  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:23):**  about the future of food. Secondly, perhaps it's important that those who produce food,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:29):**  whether they are people owning assets like farms or fishing boats or people who are working  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:34):**  in the food sector, are more densely involved in the thinking through how to make food systems  
**[0:04:41-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:41):**  more resilient and also beneficial. And thirdly, perhaps we need to take advantage of the fact  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:49):**  that COVID is exposing the cracks that Melissa just described to bring as many groups as  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:04:56):**  possible together, a dialogue about what COVID means for them when it comes to rethinking  
**[0:05:03-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:03):**  their food systems so that there is a collective willingness to shift. I'm more and more of  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:10):**  the opinion that without dialogue, we can't shift, but with dialogue, there's a real possibility  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:15):**  of significance happening.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:17):**  One of the things that I'm struck by is that you've been a champion of the One Health approach  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:21):**  for much of your career.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:23):**  One Health brings together the thought and actions of veterinary health practitioners,  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:30):**  human health practitioners, environmental health practitioners, and potentially more  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:36):**  health actors, just simply to give them an opportunity to cross between disciplines and  
**[0:05:42-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:42):**  be enriched by that experience. Now, I love that way of working and have always been somebody  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:48):**  who believes that the most exciting shifts in what we are thinking about and doing come  
**[0:05:52-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:52):**  from working at interfaces. But it's not everybody who likes that, and some prefer the comfort  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:05:59):**  of being within a defined discipline and in fact get quite nervous of interdisciplinary  
**[0:06:05-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:05):**  working.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:06):**  My own view, therefore, is that we have to continue to work to try to improve the way  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:12):**  in which One Health actors operate together, recognising that they are tribally distinct  
**[0:06:19-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:19):**  and finding crosswalks that are comfortable for everybody. That means constant effort.  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:24):**  I'd love to know what Melissa thinks about the challenges of getting One Health to come  
**[0:06:29-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:29):**  to life.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:30):**  Well, David, I would completely agree with that. And I was involved a few years ago in  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:36):**  a very big One Health focus project. It involved 19 institutions across the world from medical  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:41):**  and veterinary and environmental and indeed social science backgrounds. And on the one  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:45):**  hand, it was the most positive experience because bringing those groups together around  
**[0:06:51-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:51):**  real world problems in real places, and this was a study of the relationships between people  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:06:55):**  in ecology and diseases in around Rift Valley fever in East Africa, trachinomyosis in Zimbabwe,  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:01):**  Lassa fever in Sierra Leone. Working together around real world problems was tremendously  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:05):**  exciting, but there was always a tendency for people to go back to their institutions  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:10):**  after the meeting, after the fieldwork and latch back into their silos. And I think that's  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:15):**  a function of the way our professions and our universities and scientific institutions  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:21):**  are structured and the incentives for people. I think we also saw a degree of politics actually  
**[0:07:27-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:27):**  in hierarchies in One Health. So it is very often the medical professionals who dominate  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:33):**  despite the fact that sometimes it's the vets who have more of a grasp on those real local  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:38):**  interactions. And then there's the social element, which is the background that I bring.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:43):**  I'm an anthropologist at heart, which are so crucial for actually understanding how  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:49):**  One Health can work in a real world, which is a world of people and relationships and  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:54):**  cultural understandings and knowledges that are informal as well as formal and are a crucial  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:07:59):**  part of grounding One Health in the real world in contexts that matter in those deep local  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:05):**  people ecosystem interactions, but ultimately are what we need. So on the one hand, I'm  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:11):**  absolutely with you on the need for dialogue. I think I would add to that dialogue the importance  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:17):**  of bringing in community members in diverse places around the world. They have to be part  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:23):**  of that dialogue if One Health is to work for people in places. But I also recognize  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:28):**  that this is very difficult and it's quite political in a small peace sense. And that  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:33):**  really moving forward with this One Health agenda is going to require challenges to the  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:38):**  status quo and usual ways of doing things. But maybe COVID-19 gives us an opportunity.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:44):**  Maybe again, it's a crisis which will open up some new spaces for some proper dialogue  
**[0:08:49-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:49):**  and collaboration, which I completely agree is what we need.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:52):**  I wonder, David, what the role of the World Health Organization has been in the past looking  
**[0:08:57-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:08:57):**  through this One Health lens and the degree to which in the past the WHO has been focused  
**[0:09:04-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:04):**  on this zoonotic risk and engaged in the idea that agriculture in particular interfaces  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:11):**  with wild spaces and encroaches, intervenes in wild spaces and the risks that that raises.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:18):**  Thank you very much indeed. I want to start from what Melissa just said about how when  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:23):**  you're working to help people be comfortable with a behavior that crosses different disciplines  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:30):**  and crosses the organizational comfort of from one discipline to another, it requires  
**[0:09:36-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:36):**  paying attention to the power relationships and organizing principles in these different  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:43):**  disciplinary institutions. You see, in my experience, the One Health approach works  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:49):**  really well in local communities where people are dealing with human health, animal health,  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:09:55):**  environmental health issues at the same time, and they are having to actually shift from  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:02):**  one disciplinary mindset to another quite quickly.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:06):**  My big area where I learned this was in Thailand when we were dealing with H5N1 avian influenza.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:13):**  We saw that women poultry keepers often keeping say five to 50,000 hens were also very much  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:23):**  becoming One Health practitioners in their own place and working with local health and  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:29):**  agricultural workers to do it. And I just want to continue to stress that this makes  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:35):**  sense local, but it gets much more complicated when you go away from the local into the institutions.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:41):**  You mentioned just now the World Health Organization. Just let me just share with you a couple of  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:46):**  things on this. I work for the World Health Organization for a spell, but I also worked  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:50):**  in food, which got me close to the Food and Agriculture Organization. And when I was working  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:10:55):**  on bird flu, I worked with the International Organization of Epizoea or the World Organization  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:01):**  for Animal Health, which is a slightly different entity as well. And what I learned through  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:05):**  this is that it's much tougher to be navigating the junctions between disciplines when you're  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:11):**  on the big apex institutions, simply because they act as places where disciplinary thinking  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:18):**  is very strongly reinforced and incentivized. Whereas for One Health work, you need to work  
**[0:11:23-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:23):**  outside that. So yeah, I think that in WHO, the One Health lens is useful, but it's at  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:30):**  the local level that the One Health lens is most useful. And I wouldn't want to suggest  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:36):**  that we should take the temperature on where the One Health movement is by what is happening  
**[0:11:40-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:40):**  inside the big institutions. We should take the temperature by what is happening where  
**[0:11:44-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:44):**  people are actually doing the work. I hope that somehow.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:47):**  There is this disconnect between local action, which very often is much more One Health focused.  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:54):**  It understands the different interactions that take place between peoples and communities,  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:11:59):**  between nature and animals. And then, as you say, David, when you get to global institutions  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:04):**  that through the way that they work, the governance and the disciplines that they need, it often  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:10):**  feels that there is this attempt to control at a global scale when actually there needs  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:15):**  to be more empowerment.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:17):**  Yeah. I mean, people like us who kind of work either in institutions or around institutions  
**[0:12:24-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:24):**  have limited power to actually give power to others. But what we can do is create environments  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:33):**  within which connections are made, environments that are safe within which people can explore  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:39):**  beyond their usual comfortable and secure zones, and environments within which they  
**[0:12:44-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:44):**  can be rewarded with these more unusual ways of working. I see certainly that is my role.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:52):**  And if I can do anything over the next few months, it is to try to do that.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:12:56):**  So to bring people together from different disciplines to share information much more  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:01):**  effectively than perhaps, you know, we're used to doing it. And certainly that's your  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:05):**  approach as well, Melissa.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:07):**  Absolutely. I think there's also an opportunity to learn from below, as it were. I'm involved  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:13):**  in another project at the moment, which is about pandemic preparedness and response.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:18):**  And we're arguing very strongly for a perspective that takes much more notice of the creative  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:24):**  innovations and solutions people are coming up with in their own communities, in their  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:28):**  neighbourhoods, to prepare for and respond to the current COVID pandemic and others,  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:33):**  and to its economic and social fallout. And I think this applies absolutely to the One  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:37):**  Health paradigm as well. I think there are so many examples emerging around the world.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:43):**  And part of the response is to try and make sure those are empowered and not blocked,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:48):**  as they sometimes are, by government policies and restrictions in their particular countries  
**[0:13:52-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:52):**  and indeed are recognised and given the resources they need to flourish.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:13:56):**  But I think there are also opportunities to learn across places and for bringing together  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:02):**  some of these experiences so that people elsewhere can learn from them. And there are some really  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:08):**  key networks emerging that have helped this. I mean, some of them, some of the important  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:12):**  ones existed prior to COVID-19, things like the Food Sovereignty Network or the Agroecology  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:17):**  Movement and La Via Campesina, which is important, was important there. I think there are also  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:22):**  opportunities for some One Health localised networks to emerge and share experiences.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:28):**  And this would also be a way to go. But I think it requires a humility often in countries  
**[0:14:33-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:33):**  to be able to look to examples, perhaps from a very different part of the world, and see  
**[0:14:37-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:37):**  what they might take from them. One of the things that's actually excited me about COVID  
**[0:14:42-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:42):**  19 is the way in which it's actually reversed the narrative that we're used to around health  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:48):**  environment interactions, where typically, if you look back over the past, whether it's  
**[0:14:52-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:14:52):**  H5N1 or swine flu or SARS, we've seen an outbreak emerging in a far distant place out of Africa,  
**[0:15:00-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:00):**  out of Asia and threatening global centres of power. COVID-19 has reversed that typical  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:05):**  outbreak narrative. And what we've got, of course, now is much higher infection rates  
**[0:15:09-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:09):**  in Europe, in the US, and many examples of creative response in African settings, in  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:16):**  Asian settings, and in little parts of Latin America. And I think this gives a really important  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:21):**  opportunity to try and challenge some of those big power dynamics about who learns from who,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:27):**  about where the seeds of hope and seeds of transformation are going to emerge from in  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:32):**  the new mindsets, the new paradigms that we actually need to live well with nature and  
**[0:15:37-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:37):**  manage these complex relationships between health and ecology and people into the future.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:43):**  And I see great calls for optimism in these creative solutions in communities, but also  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:48):**  the chance to network them up to support the grassroots movements, to amplify them and  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:53):**  learn from them everywhere.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:15:55):**  Inevitable that kind of big institutions, whether it's international organisations or  
**[0:16:01-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:01):**  universities or even governments actually do act as a deterrent or even a blocker to  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:08):**  creative energy from local level percolating through and getting more to our collective  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:14):**  consciousness.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:15):**  I'd like to think that they don't have to. I think they often do. But part of the shift  
**[0:16:22-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:22):**  in mindset, in paradigm that we need, if you like, is to foster the kind of engaged science,  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:30):**  engaged scholarship, which is actually working much more thoroughly in modes that are not  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:35):**  just interdisciplinary, bringing different disciplines together, but transdisciplinary  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:40):**  and engaged where one interacts and works with people in society, whether it's civil  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:46):**  society organisations, citizens, people in communities, progressive small businesses,  
**[0:16:52-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:52):**  as well as actually those in the bigger institutions. And I see a lot of prospect for actually trying  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:16:58):**  to build these transdisciplinary engaged alliances in taking forward some of these big changes  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:03):**  that we need. It does require a shift so that that kind of work is acknowledged and recognised.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:10):**  But I see the signs of that actually beginning to come. We've got in the UK, we have a research  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:15):**  excellence framework, which often divides people back into their disciplinary silos,  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:21):**  but nevertheless, credits impact. And impact, I think it's increasingly recognised, is often  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:26):**  achieved through these transdisciplinary engaged alliances. So that's beginning to come.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:31):**  I wonder if with the time that we have left, we could just sort of focus a little bit on  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:34):**  how the global food system has responded and where the greatest strengths have been and  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:39):**  where you think the challenges are.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:41):**  Well, I was going to defer because Melissa's just done this most amazing piece of work,  
**[0:17:46-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:46):**  but just three very quick things for me. One, I don't think that our current food systems  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:17:53):**  are really good at responding to rapid emergence of hunger and risks of malnutrition. And I've  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:00):**  sensed an awful lot of people went very hungry very quickly in the last few weeks. And I  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:06):**  think that will go on as long as this disease does lead to movement restrictions being imposed.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:12):**  Secondly, I still think that smallholders have faced really difficult situations because  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:18):**  of sudden collapse in their markets, particularly if they've got perishable food. And so therefore  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:24):**  shortening supply chains so that farmers can get closer to people in need must be a priority.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:31):**  And thirdly, civil society is so important when you've got these kinds of really emergent  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:36):**  challenges happening. And it's just civil society has just not been adequately financed  
**[0:18:42-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:42):**  to be able to respond to need. So I've seen three bad, bad areas emerging. OK, so things  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:49):**  might be getting easier, but there's been an off and off distress in the last few weeks.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:54):**  And surely that could have been avoided.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:18:56):**  It seems to me that there has been a drive both from the marketplace and from governance  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:01):**  structures to push towards bigger is better, longer supply chains. And actually, you know,  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:06):**  the solutions that you're talking about there are about sort of reintegrating diversity,  
**[0:19:11-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:11):**  not only diversity, you know, in terms of nature, like we were talking about before  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:14):**  the importance of diversity in nature and agricultural systems, but diversity in terms  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:19):**  of the way that we bring food to people, the way that the marketplace works.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:24):**  Diversity is incredibly important for resilience, which is what we're really talking about.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:28):**  We need food systems that are resilient to shocks that can keep going and keep feeding  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:33):**  people despite those shocks. And diversity of produce of systems is often a very, very  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:39):**  good buffer to vulnerability to shocks. So I would completely agree with that. I think  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:44):**  we've seen vulnerabilities definitely in those long, clunky supply chains which have been  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:49):**  vulnerable to transport restrictions and movement controls, but sometimes also to shorter supply  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:54):**  chains. And I think some of the closures of local markets that have gone on in many countries  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:19:59):**  in the name of public health and of lockdown have been short sighted and damaging, damaging  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:05):**  to smallholders, damaging to people trying to market their produce and keep their livelihoods  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:09):**  going but also damaging to food access where people are deeply dependent on them. And I  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:13):**  think the needed to be and still needs to be more creative thinking about how you can  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:17):**  socially distance local markets and continue to enable them to operate effectively.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:22):**  I think social protection systems, which have been the bailout in many countries have been  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:28):**  vital. And I think this is a period where we've seen absolutely the value and importance  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:33):**  of the cash transfers to sort of hold support people's entitlements to food, which have  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:38):**  been vital, but they've often been under financed. And even the countries that have really gone  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:42):**  for this in a big way, like South Africa, with big state support have often found that  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:47):**  the support has not been adequate and people are falling through the bottom. And then I  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:51):**  think the positive move we've seen here, I'd agree with David, is actually the community  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:20:56):**  solidarities and neighbourhoods who often have stepped out to feed their vulnerable.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:01):**  And often it's within a community that you know who your vulnerable people are. Many  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:05):**  examples again, from all around the world of people helping to keep food going for each  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:10):**  other, whether it's donations to food banks in the UK or neighbourhood distribution schemes.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:14):**  And I think state support to these has been vital. Sometimes it's really been lacking.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:20):**  Sometimes it's been positive. Two positive examples, very different places. One would  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:23):**  be Kerala, where in India, local women's groups who've been supplying people with food have  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:29):**  had a lot of local government support. Another very close to home down the road for me in  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:33):**  Brighton where the Brighton and Hose Food Partnership, a long existing collaborative  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:38):**  between farmers, food suppliers, voluntary organisations and the local council, have  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:43):**  stepped up to keep food supplies going in COVID and have again formed a really good  
**[0:21:48-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:48):**  partnership between civil society and local government. But a lot of this is about localisation.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:54):**  And I think with COVID in many countries, we've seen an attempt to centralise response,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:21:59):**  whereas it's actually support to local responses through links between government and civil  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:04):**  society that offer us the best ways forward. Looking at the UK, the way that the food system  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:10):**  has been disrupted has seems to me to be much more linked to the amount of money that people  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:15):**  have available, whether people still have jobs, the increase in poverty that has then  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:19):**  meant that many more people are needing to turn to food banks and similar sorts of community  
**[0:22:25-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:25):**  based institutions. But actually, aside from the panic buying at the beginning, the food  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:29):**  has stayed on the shelves and it has kept flowing. And I wonder, first of all, whether  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:35):**  that experience has been played out elsewhere in the world, whether our experience in the  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:40):**  UK is relatively similar to other more developing countries, I suppose. And the other aspect  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:45):**  is that panic buying element was a real problem to start with and the role of the media in  
**[0:22:51-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:51):**  driving that panic. And I wonder if you'd be able to comment on how you feel the media  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:22:56):**  has behaved throughout this, whether it has been responsible in the way that it's communicated  
**[0:23:02-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:02):**  the challenges we face.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:03):**  Thank you very much indeed. Just to do quick things, because again, I feel Melissa has  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:09):**  greater knowledge on this than me. First of all, as I understand it in the UK and in many  
**[0:23:15-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:15):**  other countries, food has continued to flow from producers to consumers via retail system,  
**[0:23:23-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:23):**  but at a considerable cost in that a large number of farmers have not been able to recoup  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:31):**  their costs of growing their food, whether it is crops or vegetables or animals, because  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:38):**  of the way in which the remuneration structure is operating. And we've got major outbreaks  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:44):**  of COVID in many food processing plants in, for example, North America and Europe, particularly  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:50):**  meat and fish, but also vegetables. So the food's coming through, but at a cost, and  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:23:56):**  that cost is driving down prices and driving down the earnings of people working in the  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:02):**  system. I don't think that's right. I think that needs work. And secondly, just quickly  
**[0:24:07-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:07):**  on the media, because I am totally focused on how we're all having to make sense in our  
**[0:24:13-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:13):**  heads and in our hearts about this new phenomenon that's affecting all of us. And that means  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:20):**  that we are hugely dependent, not just on reported information, but also on discursive  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:26):**  information. And I'm totally overwhelmed and positive and excited about the amount of debate  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:32):**  there is in the media. I appreciate some get concerned about what they call misinformation.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:36):**  As far as I'm concerned, the more the better. And if people are having to work through conspiracy  
**[0:24:43-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:43):**  theories and so on, so be it. It's part of life. And I think that's good. So I'm really,  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:50):**  really in favour of and encouraging more and more and more dialogue about this. And I love  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:24:55):**  the way the media has just got fully engaged. Kind of, obviously, I wish there were more  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:00):**  things in certain outlets, but I don't control who's on the dealing with the editorial structure.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:06):**  Goodness, delighted about the nature of the debate.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:09):**  So embracing diversity in the narrative as well.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:12):**  Yes.  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:13):**  Yeah, completely. I don't think I've got very much to add to what David has said, actually.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:18):**  I mean, I think to some extent it's been a surprise and the fears that in the UK drove  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:23):**  a lot of the panic buying that suddenly we would not have, I don't know, pasta and olive  
**[0:25:28-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:28):**  oil on our shelves or even loo roll have not come true. And it's quite interesting that  
**[0:25:34-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:34):**  they haven't, because I think people thought they would. But I think it's, I would agree  
**[0:25:39-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:39):**  with David that supply chains have been maintained, but at a cost, at a number of costs to workers,  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:46):**  to those involved in packing and so on. I think there's also been, it's also the maintenance  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:51):**  of supply to consumers in the UK has also been very much maintained by supermarkets  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:25:57):**  and it's been smaller retailers who have often suffered. And I hope very much that we'll  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:02):**  be able to see those begin again to flourish, because I think we need a diversity of food  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:09):**  outlets and consumption choices as well. I think there's also been quite an interesting  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:14):**  move in the UK towards, obviously with the closure of restaurants and abilities to eat  
**[0:26:20-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:20):**  in other places, a growing interest again in food and in cooking, which in some ways  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:26):**  has been positive and is something to build on. But it's also been quite class-based and  
**[0:26:31-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:31):**  quite unequal and the luxury of being able to spend one's lockdown period cooking creative  
**[0:26:37-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:37):**  meals for one's family is quite a middle-class one. And it's not shared equally and it's  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:42):**  certainly not shared by those whose incomes have declined and they can't afford fresh  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:46):**  goods and foods and are having to turn to cheaper foods, which are often less healthy.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:51):**  So I think we're seeing some big divides opening up in consumption and in equity of access,  
**[0:26:57-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:26:57):**  not just to food per se, but to good nutritious food, which is good for people's diets and  
**[0:27:02-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:02):**  health into the future. And I think those are issues to watch very carefully as well  
**[0:27:06-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:06):**  on the consumption, as well as the production and supply side.  
**[0:27:10-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:10):**  Thank you. And David, just finally, this pandemic isn't going away anytime soon, is it?  
**[0:27:14-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:14):**  No, virus is here to stay. It's quite likely that the world will have to learn to live  
**[0:27:20-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:20):**  with it for a number of years because the potential for eradication of the virus using  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:26):**  a vaccine is very low and there's no evidence that some kind of population immunity is going  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:32):**  to develop in the foreseeable future either. And so that means that every society will  
**[0:27:37-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:37):**  almost certainly find that its ability to be able to live with the virus without having  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:43):**  considerable disruption to economic and social systems is going to be a determining factor  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:49):**  on whether that society is able to compete in and contribute to the world of the future.  
**[0:27:56-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:56):**  Thank you very much. We've only scratched the surface on so many of these issues that  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-the-WHO--IPES-Food-egchdh#t=0:27:59):**  we've touched upon, but thank you very much for sharing the time with us this morning.

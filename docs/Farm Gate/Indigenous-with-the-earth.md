**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. Today I'm delving into the origins  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:10):**  of regenerative agriculture. What is this knowledge? Where does it come from? Can anyone  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:15):**  claim ownership over regenerative principles? And how can we ensure that the phrase regenerative  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:21):**  agriculture isn't just hijacked and used to greenwash business as usual?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:26):**  Reginaldo Haslid Marroqu√≠n is the president of the Regenerative Agriculture Alliance.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:31):**  Originally from Guatemala, Rehi lives in Minnesota, USA, where he trains farmers in the production  
**[0:00:37-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:37):**  of regenerative poultry. His book, In the Shadow of the Green Man, weaves together stories  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:43):**  from his upbringing in revolution-torn Guatemala with his vision for regenerative farming.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:49):**  Hello, Rehi. Hi, nice being here with you and thanks for  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:52):**  this opportunity. Now, you've said that regenerative agriculture  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:00:56):**  is about being indigenous to the earth. What does that mean?  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:01):**  It's actually a very simple question to understand. We are actually born indigenous to the earth.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:07):**  It wasn't that long ago when we were being born completely naked out in the bush somewhere.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:13):**  That's not very long, in fact, in geological time, 50,000 years, maybe 40,000 years, but  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:19):**  that's not even a blink of an eye. Now, we just have disconnected ourselves from  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:23):**  that original being. We are born out of the elements of the earth. We came to be in the  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:30):**  womb of our mothers from the elements of the earth, from what our mothers ate, from the  
**[0:01:36-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:36):**  food that came from the earth. And so being indigenous simply means recognizing our belonging  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:43):**  to not only the earth and its elements and how we have formed, shaped and how we have  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:49):**  evolved over time, over evolutionary time, geo-evolutionary time, and then understanding  
**[0:01:54-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:01:54):**  that we are simply one of the many multiple levels and incredible diversity of living  
**[0:02:03-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:03):**  systems on earth. We are simply one of them. And so as one of them, we are not outside  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:10):**  of nature, but rather we are nature. And when we think of ourselves from that perspective,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:16):**  then this idea that we have that we are the kings of the hill and that we can exploit  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:22):**  everything else to our advantage. And actually at the end of the day, to our own demise,  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:27):**  that whole mentality, which we call colonizing mentality and the colonization of everything  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:32):**  sort of kind of starts fading away and we reclaim more of that ancestral way of thinking  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:38):**  and being. It seems to me that people in rich nations  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:42):**  around the world, we tend to think of indigenous as being something that happens over there.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:47):**  It's something that happens in lower or middle income countries. And from what you're saying,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:51):**  it's almost as though we can all be indigenous. We are indigenous, that being indigenous is  
**[0:02:56-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:02:56):**  about what we do rather than what we are. It's a way of being. You can be indigenous  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:02):**  or not. And most people have chosen not to be indigenous, not to relate to the other  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:07):**  living systems in the way we are designed. And every time we do that, we separate ourselves  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:13):**  from our own capacity to naturally regenerate. And that's why the concept of regenerative,  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:18):**  it really isn't something that just came about in the last what, five years, 10 years,  
**[0:03:23-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:23):**  since corporations and nonprofits and think tanks started to appropriate it from the ancestral  
**[0:03:28-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:28):**  ways of being. So yeah, you can be regenerative, you can be indigenous, but nobody owns that.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:35):**  Nobody controls that. You can't define that. You can only be it.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:38):**  Okay. So you're saying there that regenerative agriculture, that an indigenous approach has  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:43):**  been appropriated by NGOs and by companies, essentially by white people in these high-income  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:49):**  countries. And I'm just wondering, what do you mean by that? How is that appropriation  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:53):**  taking place?  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:03:54):**  Well, it's the same way as we have done it for like, Sherry Mitchell in her book, Sacred  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:00):**  Instructions points out the origins of this way of colonization that has taken over the  
**[0:04:05-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:05):**  world started in her anthropological studies at around 3000 years ago with the commoditation  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:11):**  of women. That's how she lays it out. Now we can agree or disagree on those specific  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:17):**  things. But the bottom line is that from then we started this very methodical, disciplined  
**[0:04:24-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:24):**  way of building governance, ownership, control of resources and infrastructure and ways of  
**[0:04:33-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:33):**  being, of communicating, of shaping populations for the purpose of a single purpose to extract  
**[0:04:40-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:40):**  as much value as possible out of everything that is below you. So if you got some money,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:47):**  you go out there and you try to extract more money from others on the basis of your money.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:52):**  If you got land, then you go and try to extract the most out of that land on the basis of  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:04:57):**  the fact that you have land. If you had slaves, then in the South and the United States, you  
**[0:05:02-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:02):**  would go in and because you had slaves, you could extract more value out of both the slaves  
**[0:05:07-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:07):**  and the land and the market. So in the market, we tried to sell to them at the highest bidder.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:13):**  And on the other side, we tried to produce at the lowest potential depressed point of  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:19):**  cost. That mentality really is what got us to where we are today. And that is now the  
**[0:05:26-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:26):**  way we are approaching most of these new spaces that we're encountering. And so, yes, it just  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:32):**  happens that most of the colonizing infrastructure is to a great extent almost invisible. The  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:37):**  remaining part that is controlled by other folks, most of it is controlled by white males.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:44):**  And so, yes, it is a white male phenomena across the world that we are now appropriating  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:50):**  these ways of thinking. Christopher Columbus did the same thing. He came over and quote  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:05:55):**  unquote found these new territories. Okay, so this is what happened today. This just  
**[0:06:01-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:01):**  white dominated global society of nonprofits and corporations and so on have now come into  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:08):**  contact with this new very fascinating ancestral way of thinking called indigenous. And so  
**[0:06:14-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:14):**  they figured, okay, well, the natives here in the United States call their territory  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:19):**  something else too. But the colonizers said, no, no, no, that's not good enough. We're  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:23):**  gonna call it America or whatever, right? And so the same thing, oh, we're gonna call  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:27):**  this other space regenerative. And so now comes the regenerative term and now you start  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:32):**  putting everything you normally have done within that. And then you start defining it  
**[0:06:37-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:37):**  so that it fits what you do rather than becoming what it was supposed to be. And so this is  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:42):**  the process and this is repeating again and again and again.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:46):**  You're describing a revolution almost that regenerative agriculture, this is a quiet  
**[0:06:52-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:52):**  revolution pulling down this sort of, you know, white male driven extractive model that's  
**[0:06:58-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:06:58):**  grown up over the last 300 years to create something which is building on ancestral knowledge  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:04):**  so that we start regenerating the natural cycles and natural systems around us.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:09):**  Exactly. I mean, you either regenerate or you don't. Whether you name it regenerative,  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:15):**  whether you set up five claims that you say, okay, this is why we are regenerative or not,  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:20):**  that is totally irrelevant. Whether you have a brand that says regenerative, that's not  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:25):**  meant to do with it. And the other thing that a lot of these colonizers in this space are  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:30):**  missing is the fact that you really can't have regenerative products because, you know,  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:36):**  even our chickens, okay, we have this regenerative poultry system, but the chicken itself is  
**[0:07:42-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:42):**  not regenerative. What is regenerative is the system and that is being missed across  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:47):**  the board. I mean, we have now reduced the concept of regenerative, so to practices on  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:07:52):**  the land, to soil health, to, you know, minute reductionist ways of thinking, which is blatantly  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:00):**  a colonizing mentality right there.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:02):**  Well, let's get into that in just a little while. But before we do, I just want to go  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:05):**  back into your own history. You grew up in Guatemala during the revolution that claimed  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:11):**  over 200,000 lives. And I wonder how this upbringing affected your relationship with  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:17):**  the earth and with agriculture. Were you one of a kind or was the way that you farmed something  
**[0:08:22-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:22):**  which was quite standard in the place that you grew up?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:25):**  Well, we were not one of a kind as on a regional ecosystem basis in northern Guatemala where  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:30):**  I grew up. But we were definitely, we definitely stuck out. I am happy to say that I was part  
**[0:08:37-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:37):**  of a very intelligent group of adults and mentors that saw the problem we had of lack  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:46):**  of food and, you know, literally misery. I mean, we lived between, I always say we were  
**[0:08:51-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:51):**  not even poor, we were between poverty and absolutely nothing. And within that context,  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:08:58):**  one of the things that happens in your brain, and this is true anywhere else where you live  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:02):**  in crisis, is that you actually start to relate closely to the actual reality of things. You  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:07):**  don't live in this privileged world where everything works because guess what, you know,  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:12):**  it doesn't matter what you do, you're not going to die. You're not going to go hungry  
**[0:09:16-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:16):**  for a week if you make a mistake. And so within those conditions, if you actually use what  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:23):**  we call innate intelligence, and on the basis of that innate intelligence, you cultivate  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:28):**  the indigenous intellect, indigenous intellect and innate intelligence having nothing to  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:33):**  do with universities and PhDs and none of that stuff, by the way. This is the stuff  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:37):**  we are born with. And so when we use that, and that is what happened in my childhood  
**[0:09:43-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:43):**  is that I was exposed to adults who were thinking deeply about the reality, responsible individuals  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:50):**  who saw no extraction, who saw no profit. They saw a way to ensure our survival and  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:09:56):**  they knew that the food was the most important thing. I went all the way through sixth, seventh  
**[0:10:02-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:02):**  grade barefoot. We didn't have enough money to buy clothes. So we, my mother made our  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:09):**  shirts and we, you know, the buttons sometimes were all crooked and shorts, it was warm,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:15):**  tropical climate. So we could, we didn't need full pants. That's how we went around. You  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:21):**  know, our, our long pants were full of patches, not because of style, but because that's the  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:25):**  only way we could afford, right? So I'm talking about real stuff, real poverty, but also real  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:31):**  intellect. And we were able to cultivate that. And when we started to identify with that  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:36):**  native intelligence and we started to cultivate the indigenous intellect, we stopped slashing,  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:41):**  we stopped burning the forest and we started seeing the whole ecosystem for what it was.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:47):**  And that's when we started to get out of poverty, hunger and malnutrition. And we built literally  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:10:53):**  a whole new ecosystem and a whole new economy for our family and for quite a few other neighbors  
**[0:11:00-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:00):**  who were willing to follow and join in. And so, yeah, that's, that's how it came about,  
**[0:11:06-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:06):**  this way of thinking.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:07):**  And in that you were harvesting, I think you said every week rather than just, you know,  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:12):**  once or twice or three times a year.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:14):**  Yeah. Just to give you an idea, we had 22 parcels at 7,000 square meters, but I think  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:20):**  it's about 30 acres. So in those 30 acres, we divided it according to micro ecosystems.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:26):**  I mean, we didn't call it that of course, because we didn't know that there was such  
**[0:11:30-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:30):**  a thing. We didn't have the lexicon, but we could see that certain things will grow in  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:35):**  certain places and others would grow in other places. The one thing we observed is that  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:39):**  some of the native species were marketable, highly marketable and very priced in the market.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:45):**  And so, you know, Chico Zapotes, you know, Calucar from Zapota, for example, that's a  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:50):**  world known fruit. It was naturally growing. We had trees of over a meter in diameter,  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:11:55):**  which everybody else was cutting. And all you had to do was look up and observe the  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:00):**  incredible amount of fruit on that biomass in weight perspective, for example, the canopy  
**[0:12:06-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:06):**  of that tree would produce in excess of probably 10 times the amount of other things that you  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:13):**  could, you could grow in that space if you cut that tree. But the other thing is that  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:18):**  tree was already producing and it was probably a hundred years old. Meanwhile, if you cut  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:23):**  it, it will be a year before you started seeing new saplings and five to six years before  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:28):**  you even saw anything. So the net, the net economic value of working with that tree was  
**[0:12:35-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:35):**  so massive. I mean, massive at a level that new economies today that looks at agricultural  
**[0:12:42-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:42):**  crops and even has an idea. This is how massive it was. Now, we could see it because we started  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:49):**  to develop an indigenous intellect, which is removed from you as you go through the  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:54):**  so-called formal education because we are trained on colonizing system of linear ways.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:12:59):**  And so you lose that circularity, that circular economic ways of thinking. And that is really  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:05):**  what we came in touch with is that it's just mind blowing potential for feeding the world  
**[0:13:12-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:12):**  over in so much smaller blueprint on the land than what we are doing today in the name of  
**[0:13:19-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:19):**  supposedly feeding the world.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:21):**  Now, Rekhi, your book is called In the Shadow of the Green Man. I'm just wondering who is  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:27):**  the green man?  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:28):**  All right. So think of yourself as a, in that case, we moved to the Northern rainforest  
**[0:13:34-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:34):**  when I was four. Give it a couple more years and the war is really starting to rage and  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:42):**  the army is everywhere and you are six years old. By the time you are seven years old,  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:49):**  as you know, from a neurological perspective, your brain is really gotten to that space  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:13:55):**  where you built all of its trunks and connecting and trimming and all of that. Well, you in  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:01):**  those conditions, you got to figure a way to cope because nobody can talk to you about  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:07):**  things. You want to know stuff, but knowledge is seen as subversive. A professor, our director  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:14):**  of our elementary school was, you know, literally, you know, kind of engulfed by the local military  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:20):**  base because they needed to control everything he did. The teachers were monitored as to  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:26):**  what they were teaching. Questioning was like forbidden. Asking questions was seen like,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:32):**  okay, why is he asking those questions? And it didn't matter if you were a kid. And so  
**[0:14:37-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:37):**  Green Man became this imaginary friend that I built out in my imagination since I was  
**[0:14:44-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:44):**  a kid. And it just happens that Green Man knew so many things. He had these superpowers.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:50):**  Green Man could see through like that, like an eagle, you know, they could see a grass  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:14:55):**  hopper jump in the bottom of the forest through a little opening in the canopy while they  
**[0:15:01-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:01):**  flew up 30 miles an hour and they could see that hopper because of that fine tune scale.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:09):**  They could hear everything. They could smell everything. Green Man could do all of those  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:15):**  things like we knew about the most skilled animals in the forest. In the night, he could  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:20):**  see everything as well, you know, putting its hands on the ground. It could sense the  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:24):**  feelings of everything around. It wasn't until lately, in the last few years, that scientists  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:30):**  started to talk about the microsphere and the internet of the earth, which is the mycorrhizal  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:36):**  networks of the earth. Well, I was telling stories to my kids, you know, 25 years ago  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:42):**  about how Green Man communicated across continents by the mycorrhizal systems on the earth. That's  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:49):**  just native intelligence for you right there. And it is indigenous intellect and it's just  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:15:54):**  as accurate as any scientific paper that has been produced at any university. And so that's  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:00):**  what Green Man did. Green Man answered every question because Green Man knew everything.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:05):**  And you know what? This is where we actually have to reflect to the fact that when we talk  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:11):**  about finding solutions to the global crises that we are facing, okay, stop for a second  
**[0:16:18-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:18):**  because every single person on earth, if they embrace their indigenousness, they have a  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:24):**  Green Man who knows everything already. All the answers are already written right there  
**[0:16:29-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:29):**  in you.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:30):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:16:50-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:16:50):**  Well, number one, yes. And we have numbers to prove it. Number two, I'll question  
**[0:17:20-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:17:20):**  you in terms of what was not practical about what I just described. Because yeah, to get  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:17:26):**  practical actually, you have to stop looking at the world the way we see it right now because  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:17:31):**  that's not practical. It is not practical to destroy the ecosystems of the earth and  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:17:36):**  expect them to produce for us. That is what's not practical. It is not practical to take  
**[0:17:41-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:17:41):**  40% of the amazing geological formations and ancestral soils in the Midwest, plow them  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:17:49):**  under and put corn and soybeans. That's what's impractical. As far as mass production, well,  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:17:54):**  no, the actual current systems are not mass producing anything. They actually have undercut  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:00):**  the ability of ecosystems to mass produce. For example, at an oak, when it masts, it  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:06):**  actually mass produces. Mass produces because that's a survival instinct of every species.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:11):**  And so we squandered the mass production ability of ecosystems when we started removing the  
**[0:18:18-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:18):**  diversity which actually is what engages that mass production. We did all of this not because  
**[0:18:24-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:24):**  we wanted to feed the world. That is the lie that we were told across the world. But that  
**[0:18:30-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:30):**  lie was told for the purpose of perpetrating one of the worst crimes on earth, which is  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:36):**  the expropriation of the production systems that ensure the food security of communities  
**[0:18:41-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:41):**  on which they depend and to appropriate all of that knowledge and all of the biodiversity  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:48):**  on earth, patented and registered it and manipulated for a single purpose, for the purpose of profit  
**[0:18:55-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:18:55):**  and extraction. We did not achieve mass production. We achieved mass mechanization. And mechanization,  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:02):**  yes, because mechanization is the precursor to extraction, not to production. And then  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:07):**  as we mechanize and optimize extraction, then we optimize the enriching of a few at the  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:14):**  expense of the rest. That's what we have achieved. Don't call it agriculture. Don't call it  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:19):**  feeding the world. Don't call it food systems. That's not what they are.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:23):**  It seems to me that what you're saying is that we need a regenerative approach to food  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:28):**  production and to food supply chains, not only for the world to become genuinely food  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:33):**  secure, but for inequalities to be healed and for peace to be maintained in a future  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:38):**  disrupted by global warming. Well, yes. I mean, just think for a second,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:43):**  what causes poverty, hunger and conflict? And look at the sources of that and the way  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:48):**  we have actually manufactured the infrastructure and the systems that generate such conditions.  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:55):**  Those are not natural conditions. We have manufactured them. And we have manufactured  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:19:59):**  them with, you know, by the way, I always said when some, you know, talking heads accused  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:05):**  farmers of, you know, destroying the land and stuff, I said, well, listen, my dad doesn't  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:10):**  know how to write and read. He never learned that. And yet he's the one who taught me the  
**[0:20:14-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:14):**  most about this way of thinking and about being way more efficient about everything  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:18):**  we do in agriculture. And yes, I have an agronomy degree and I have a business development degree  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:23):**  and all of that. And that's good and dandy. But all that knowledge is worth zero without  
**[0:20:28-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:28):**  all of the wisdom that I inherited from that. Now, when we look at what cost, what is causing  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:35):**  and will continue to exacerbate the conflict, war and then the conditions that are generating  
**[0:20:41-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:41):**  the climate change, all of that is manufactured. We imagine things, we went and did them from  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:48):**  building roads and paving the land to tiling the soil in the Midwest and around the world  
**[0:20:54-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:20:54):**  to destroying the rainforest to put palm oil, all of that was engineered and deployed and  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:01):**  not by people like my dad. It was all done, including the 83,000 plus chemicals in the  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:09):**  atmosphere and in the soil and in the shops around the world were developed and engineered  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:14):**  by people, most of them with PhDs behind their names. They are the community that validated  
**[0:21:21-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:21):**  what is destroying the planet and our ability to feed ourselves and to live in peace. Now,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:27):**  to change that, they need to change first. Either that or the rest of us have to take  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:31):**  over the system and ignore that kind of approach, because if we don't do that, they will wreck  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:37):**  the planet. This is a global conversation we have to have. It's a reckoning.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:42):**  And we're back to revolution. It's, you know, these people who have land, who can manage  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:47):**  land, who farm, who have the means of food production to be able to change the system  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:52):**  from the bottom up. Now, Rekki, your particular interest, your expertise is in poultry. And  
**[0:21:58-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:21:58):**  so let's take that as our practical example of what regenerative systems look like at  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:04):**  a global level.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:05):**  Right. So if you think of it, we consume, I did these numbers for 10 billion people,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:10):**  on it. Now, our production units are designed on a one and a half acre blueprint. Now, what  
**[0:22:17-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:17):**  we did in that one and a half acre was calculate the roaming space, sprouting systems, conditions,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:25):**  water needs, and all of that within one principle criteria to return poultry to its natural  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:33):**  geo-evolutionary habitat. Now, if you look at it from an indigenous  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:38):**  eyes, then instead of thinking, okay, what do I need in order to raise chickens? You  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:43):**  flip it and you think, where would chickens thrive the most? And then, yes, from that  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:49):**  starting point, you start tweaking things so that we can accommodate mechanization to  
**[0:22:54-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:54):**  a certain degree of the things that can be mechanized. Like, for example, feeding the  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:22:59):**  chicken, watering. Well, we got piping systems and they don't interfere with the ecosystem  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:03):**  as long as we don't leave those pipes laying around and, you know, mixing with the soil.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:09):**  Those things are mechanizable. The building, of course, the chicken is going to need a  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:13):**  shelter at night. So we perfected a building system that protects the chicken from almost  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:18):**  every predator, except the weasels are the only ones that we're still having a little  
**[0:23:22-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:22):**  bit of trouble. Now, within that engineering process, what you do is you develop not a  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:29):**  blueprint for like you do with a house, but rather a blueprint of a process by which you  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:35):**  adapt the creation, the building of that natural environment that where the chicken can thrive.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:42):**  And then you apply that process to any ecology in the world where there are certain basic  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:47):**  conditions are met. One, there is enough water to sprout grain. It doesn't have to be rain,  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:53):**  but it has to be some. Two, that there is forest species, at least one story. So if  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:23:59):**  it's a high dry desert like San Miguel de Allende in Mexico, where we have one of these  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:04):**  demonstration systems, well, then it may be 10 feet tall, but it's still got a canopy  
**[0:24:09-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:09):**  because without the canopy, the chicken is not going to do well. But also because those  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:13):**  canopies are, can be adopted to be highly productive and with the chicken, they become  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:18):**  even more productive. So in the Midwest, for example, we're using hazelnuts and elderberries  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:23):**  in the US as the foundation of that understory. And then for the overstory, we'll take  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:29):**  you pick based on the local native species and pick from those native species, the one  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:33):**  that can have the most value. So in Northern Guatemala, we should pick Zapotes and Chico  
**[0:24:38-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:38):**  Zapotes and Dramon trees and all of that. Now in the Midwest, we got oaks and basswood  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:44):**  and sugar maple. But with that blueprint then and based on a one and a half acre, which  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:50):**  I'm not going to go further into it because there's a lot to it. Each unit can deliver  
**[0:24:55-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:24:55):**  us around 4500 broilers a year at one and a half acres. And at eight acres, we can produce  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:03):**  over 1.02 million eggs per production unit with 4000 egg layers divided into two production  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:10):**  units. So that's the foundational blueprint. Now to feed the world with chickens under  
**[0:25:15-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:15):**  a system like this. So for broilers, we barely need 33.3 million acres, we can regenerate  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:23):**  33 million acres on top of producing all of the broilers that we need for the world at  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:28):**  10 billion people. And we need barely 12 million acres to feed all of the eggs to everyone  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:35):**  in the world at 150 eggs a year per person, and 10 broilers a year per person. In the  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:42):**  US, the average is 20 broilers per person and 250 eggs per person. Well, if you average  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:48):**  across the world at about half of those many chickens, 10 and 150 eggs, we barely need  
**[0:25:54-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:25:54):**  44, 45 rounded up million acres to feed the whole world without ever confining an animal,  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:03):**  exploiting a person, exploiting a farmer, and on top of it, redesigning the economy  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:09):**  of over 500 million farmers. So tell me about the economy, because that's  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:14):**  the bit that I wanted to come to next, which is, you know, this isn't about big companies  
**[0:26:19-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:19):**  or big corporations that are running these smaller farms and making huge profits out  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:25):**  of that. It's an economy that's run by smaller farmers, by a multitude of smaller farmers,  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:31):**  a revitalised rural economy. Of course. And you know, the other thing  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:35):**  is that to understand circular economics, the ancestral indigenous organising structures  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:41):**  and systems of management are already time tested for tens of thousands of years. And  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:46):**  so in those systems, it's not about romanticising the small farm or any of that. It's just that  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:53):**  beyond a certain point, your returns start to diminish if you go the mechanical way.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:26:59):**  There is a point here where our energy as labourers in a farm is critical and machines  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:05):**  should never do certain things. Like a machine can't get under a bush of hazelnuts and actually  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:13):**  differentiate, or maybe somebody will invite a machine, invent a machine that can differentiate  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:18):**  at that branch or a bunch that is too low or a branch that is not producing hazelnuts  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:23):**  and then remove that. So those are things that we need people and it's important that  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:28):**  we do that. Because when we don't do that, we grow into this different mentality that  
**[0:27:32-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:32):**  turns us into monsters of the earth, right? So as you think of that, the governance, the  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:39):**  ownership and the control is central that we reflect on what we have done to that in  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:44):**  the food system, because we gave it away. We gave it away to a few corporations who  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:49):**  don't really care about our health, our community wealth and our ability to thrive and to be  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:27:56):**  resilient in the face of climate calamities, pandemics and all of that. What we are talking  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:01):**  about is mass scale systems of small farms. And so that changes the whole paradigm. And  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:08):**  the beauty of that is that the wealth creation capacity of communities is much larger than  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:14):**  a corporation. Now don't extract, communities don't extract as much and they don't make  
**[0:28:19-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:19):**  an individual as rich as extractive systems, but the wealth overall is much larger. And  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:26):**  that is the foundation to peace, stability and food security.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:29):**  Thank you for that. Putting some bones into what we're talking about, where we can see  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:33):**  how the poultry industry would be reformed, how that would change, how the economics shift.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:39):**  But when we talk about a paradigm shift like this, I wonder who's responsible for it. Somebody's  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:44):**  got to create that shift. Is it the farmers? Is it customers? How is it that ordinary people  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:50):**  can contribute to this exciting paradigm shift that we're talking about here?  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:28:55):**  Right. So we entered this larger food and agricultural ecosystem from the perspective  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:01):**  of the chicken because of that very question. What I wanted to answer way back when I was  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:06):**  in, you know, I got a methodical process of doing this, right? So there is four phases  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:10):**  to everything we do here. And there are five areas of management that we systemically apply.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:16):**  So in those four phases of development, the first one is discovery, right? So we do this,  
**[0:29:21-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:21):**  this perpetual improvement cycle that goes through the development and discovery, development,  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:26):**  discovery of information and facts and figures and trends and opportunities, supply chain,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:32):**  bottlenecks, all of those things. Development of both capacity of people to do things and  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:37):**  also development of the planning and strategies. And so the third stage is launch. That's the,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:42):**  after all, those two phases are more or less, you know, we feel comfortable as entrepreneurs.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:47):**  Then we move to the launch of something. And then after that, we move to the growth phase  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:51):**  and we'll go back to discovery again. And that's never ending cycle, right? So within  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:29:55):**  that process, when we started trying to figure out, all right, well, there is this mass,  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:00):**  you know, in the US alone is, I believe it's over five point something trillion dollar  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:04):**  industry food and beverages and agriculture, right? You can't just enter that space and  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:09):**  pretend to do a paradigm shift by going at it all over the place. You got to pick an  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:14):**  entry point. That entry point has to have two basic characteristics that you spend the  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:18):**  least amount of time convincing or defending. That way it frees up 90% of the time to actually  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:25):**  doing it. And when you put that equation together effectively, then the system feeds itself  
**[0:30:31-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:31):**  and sells itself. And the paradigm shift actually happens on its own momentum. That is the secret  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:38):**  to paradigm shift is to not push things into people down their throats, but rather demonstrate  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:45):**  that something is fundamentally magnificently better than the alternative that we are stuck  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:50):**  with and then use compassion and use all of these incredible human attributes we were  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:30:57):**  born with and become indigenous again. And when you become indigenous, then the empathy,  
**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:03):**  the oxytocin that is generated in you right now, speaking about this issue with the sense  
**[0:31:08-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:08):**  of hope and possibilities, that opens up a marvelous cocktail of chemicals in your brain  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:15):**  that makes you feel hopeful and makes you feel like you want to do this. And that is  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:19):**  the foundation of paradigm shift, because then we would start thinking differently because  
**[0:31:24-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:24):**  we have uncovered the other 95% of possibilities that we shut down when we focus on colonizing.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:31):**  That is the business of paradigm shift is 90% psychological.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:36):**  Central to what we're talking about here is a shifting of power. It's a redistribution  
**[0:31:41-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:41):**  of wealth from the hands of a few big corporations to many small and medium sized farm businesses  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:48):**  and to other actors within those supply chains and smaller retailers.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:52):**  Let me interrupt you. Let me interrupt you there, because I am not proposing that we  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:31:56):**  redistribute the wealth from corporations. All I am saying is that they had their share  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:01):**  and that we need to stop feeding them. That's all I'm saying.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:05):**  And what I'm asking really is, is there a role? Do corporations exist in a regenerative  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:11):**  future or has the power moved so much that the future is about smaller medium sized farmers,  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:18):**  smaller supply chains? Is there still a role for the big corporations that exist now in  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:22):**  this transition?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:24):**  Of course, think of it in two ways. A corporation is simply the reflection of CEOs and executive  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:31):**  teams. A corporation isn't a bad thing. A corporation is simply a legal structure by  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:36):**  which we implement our human desires. So the corporation in itself isn't the problem.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:42):**  It's to what end do we use that to extract wealth and then to put it away in some offshore  
**[0:32:48-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:48):**  account so we don't have to pay our fair share of building the environment that generates  
**[0:32:52-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:52):**  a profit in the first place? Okay, that is not that I should be legal. Why? Because it's  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:32:58):**  illegitimate. It's actually unethical at a foundational level.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:02):**  Now, when we use corporate structure for that purpose, then yes, that corporation becomes  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:07):**  a problem. But it isn't the corporate structure, it's the people who are making those decisions.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:12):**  And fortunately for us in the world today, the amount of people in the world that have  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:18):**  that kind of power and that are actually not going to change no matter what we do, it's  
**[0:33:23-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:23):**  so tiny that as we think of how to reform corporate America and inject a new generation  
**[0:33:31-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:31):**  of thinkers and innovators that actually care for the earth and for each other and for our  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:36):**  communities and for our food security, then we can start thinking about how those corporate  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:42):**  structures become incredibly pivotal to the transformation from degenerative ways to regenerative  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:49):**  indigenous ways. A clear example of some of that, a little sign of that is Exxon. Right  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:33:55):**  now you've got that global phenomenon, it's in the news everywhere. It may not be the  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:00):**  way those corporations actually get transformed. We don't know that yet. But that is one very  
**[0:34:06-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:06):**  critical example on strategies that could potentially help us repurpose a lot of this  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:13):**  infrastructure that is already in place. I mean, honestly, our chickens, they still need  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:17):**  processing facilities, they still need managers in those processing facilities. But the first  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:23):**  processing facility that we bought here in the central United States, that processing  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:28):**  facility is being turned into a worker managed and operated place. Why? Well, because then  
**[0:34:33-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:33):**  we avoid the exploitation of workers and the extraction of their value for the purpose  
**[0:34:38-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:38):**  of feeding an individual bank account somewhere. And so that creates wealth, delivers good  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:45):**  quality chicken, supports the farmers, supports the health of consumers and all of that. Nobody  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:49):**  loses out of that. The majority of us, we just want to have food security and hope,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:54):**  as I said in my book, that's all I need personally, food security and hope. And that's enough  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:34:59):**  for me to have a normal life. And there is a lot of us that way. Right at the top of  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:03):**  the podcast, you were talking about the way in which, you know, regenerative agriculture  
**[0:35:08-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:08):**  is about being indigenous with the earth. It's about ancestral knowledge and using that  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:13):**  kind of inherited ancestral knowledge. And it's not about practices, but at the same  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:18):**  time, many farmers, particularly in rich nations around the world, have become very used to  
**[0:35:22-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:22):**  a prescriptive approach to food production, where agriculture has sought to conquer nature,  
**[0:35:28-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:28):**  and to farm despite nature rather than in balance with it. And even for those who want  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:32):**  to make the transition to regen, it's sometimes hard for them to know where to start. And  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:38):**  I wonder if you think it is actually possible to codify regenerative principles with the  
**[0:35:44-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:44):**  practices so that we can help more farmers to find their way, their own way to becoming  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:50):**  indigenous with the earth. Absolutely. We have actually codified the approach with regenerative  
**[0:35:56-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:35:56):**  poultry. And fortunately for us, the loss of thermodynamics and the biophysical chemical  
**[0:36:02-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:02):**  processes that are responsible for the transformation of energy from non-edible into edible forms  
**[0:36:08-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:08):**  is universal. So yes, it can be completely codified, but on the matter of principles  
**[0:36:14-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:14):**  at a global level. If you think of from the what we call the PCIVs framework, so principles,  
**[0:36:21-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:21):**  criteria, indicators and verifiers. So principles, say ownership, control and governance of a  
**[0:36:29-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:29):**  regenerative system is not a matter of individual but collective function. That's a central  
**[0:36:36-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:36):**  principle of regenerative. Now notice I didn't start by saying soil health. Why? Because  
**[0:36:40-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:40):**  soil health is going to happen if we do this right. You don't have to codify that. Second  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:46):**  principle, design and engineer from the perspective of the natural design. So you can't have  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:51):**  regenerative cattle in the rainforest ecosystem. Well, unless cattle were part of that ecosystem  
**[0:36:57-0:37:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:36:57):**  to begin with. So if you, if we're going to regenerate, let's codify what regenerates  
**[0:37:01-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:01):**  and it is ecosystems that have to regenerate. And if you regenerate ecosystem functions,  
**[0:37:06-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:06):**  then the water regenerates, the soil regenerates, soil health is restored, photosynthetic mass  
**[0:37:11-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:11):**  capacity is restored, biological activities are restored, wildlife is restored, and you  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:17):**  still harvest, in this case, the chicken. So those are principles that are very easy  
**[0:37:22-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:22):**  to codify. Now as far as criteria, that's another layer where, you know, if you've got  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:27):**  say the Forest Stewardship Council has 10 principles, I believe they still have 10,  
**[0:37:31-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:31):**  and yet they have 75 criteria. So it's exponentially a larger set of criteria. Why is that critical?  
**[0:37:38-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:38):**  Because every ecosystem blueprint on earth has to have its own criteria. You can't develop  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:43):**  criteria for the global application of regenerative because it's not about soil health. That's  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:48):**  the foundational mistake. And then the next level is indicators. So what are the indicators?  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:37:54):**  Those could be much more reduced in number because those are very specific things that  
**[0:38:01-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:01):**  say yes, this is happening. So you test the water down, in our case here down to Keith  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:06):**  Creek, which is the watershed I'm part of. Now, if all of this is being done regeneratively,  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:12):**  then the Cannon River water quality will improve continuously over the coming years. That's  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:17):**  an indicator that we are doing the right thing in this area. Organic matter is going to increase.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:22):**  That's another indicator. It's not about carbon sequestration and carbon marketing. It's simply  
**[0:38:26-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:26):**  an indicator that your ecosystem is more productive if the organic matter goes up. Photosynthetic  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:31):**  area, the more photosynthetic area you have in an area, and the more perennial that photosynthetic  
**[0:38:37-0:38:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:37):**  surface is, the more energy you are capturing and the more efficient your system is and  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:43):**  the more transformation of energy is happening. Keep it in mind that there is three places  
**[0:38:47-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:47):**  where energy is transformed from non-edible into edible forms. Photosynthetic, the intestinal  
**[0:38:52-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:52):**  tract of animals and the chewing mechanisms and the soil. All of them, except for the  
**[0:38:57-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:38:57):**  photosynthetic, are completely biologically, physically and chemically based. Photosynthetic  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:02):**  is the only one that is mostly physical and less biological. So with that perspective,  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:08):**  you now got the pivoting points from which we can pivot principles, criteria, indicators,  
**[0:39:13-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:13):**  and then the last thing is the verifiers. That's the actual data that verifies that  
**[0:39:18-0:39:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:18):**  yes, those indicators are real, that yes, those indicators align with those principles  
**[0:39:23-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:23):**  that we set for that specific ecological blueprint. And yes, that ecological blueprint aligns  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:28):**  with the global principles of regenerative. Right there, you've got the framework for  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:32):**  global climate change solutions and for redesigning every sector of the agricultural sector. And  
**[0:39:37-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:37):**  it's exactly the blueprint we use for poultry.  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:40):**  Ricky, that's just, it's been a fantastic insight. That's all we've got time for. I  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Indigenous-with-the-earth-e12b91t#t=0:39:44):**  mean, what a force of nature you are. It's just been wonderful. Wonderful. I'd like to

### Farm Gate  (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:11:16)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Kestane.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:08):**  It was once thought that the bounty of the ocean was limitless, and that no matter how  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:12):**  much we plundered its depths, there would always be plenty more fish in the sea.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:16):**  But the last century has seen a remarkable rise in technological ingenuity, and at the  
**[0:00:21-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:21):**  same time the human population has more than trebled.  
**[0:00:24-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:24):**  The vast majority of wild caught fish are now harvested by industrial-scale trawlers  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:29):**  using vast and often indiscriminate nets and bottom trawling, leading to unprecedented  
**[0:00:34-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:34):**  levels of bycatch and discards.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:36):**  At the same time, aquaculture has scaled so rapidly that farmed fish now outstrip wild  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:41):**  caught seafood by volume with over 100 million tonnes produced globally in 2015.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:47):**  As a result, the aquaculture industry has increasingly come under fire for high levels  
**[0:00:51-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:51):**  of waste and pollution, and for poor welfare.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:54):**  If many of these challenges are offshore and out of mind, then the recent Netflix films  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:00:59):**  Sea Spiracy has dredged them back up into public consciousness.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:03):**  This is the first in a series of programmes in which we discuss the future of ocean food.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:08):**  I'm joined by Ruth Layton, who, as a former director of FAI Farms, has spent 25 years  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:13):**  studying agricultural and aquaculture systems around the world, and by Ashley Bright, an  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:19):**  expert in the science of sustainability in global food systems.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:24):**  Welcome both.  
**[0:01:25-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:25):**  Ash, can I come to you first?  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:26):**  I know there have been criticisms of Sea Spiracy.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:29):**  Do you think any of them are justified?  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:31):**  Yes, there are criticisms around some of the facts.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:34):**  For example, that the ocean will be empty by 2048, which has been contradicted by the  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:40):**  authors of the study.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:41):**  I think the NGOs were interviewed fairly aggressively, and I think those sorts of things make it  
**[0:01:47-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:47):**  easier for people to dismiss.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:49):**  And I don't know how helpful it is painting NGOs in a negative light when they are the  
**[0:01:53-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:53):**  ones actually attempting to make a difference.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:01:55):**  I think also for me, to say to just stop eating seafood was presented as a simple sort of  
**[0:02:02-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:02):**  silver bullet answer to the issues in the film.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:04):**  But there are billions of people that live in coastal areas and are associated with fishing,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:09):**  their opinion on seafood, for livelihoods, for nutrition and for culture.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:13):**  And it seems like quite a Western take to be able to say just don't eat it.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:17):**  You know, really are there sort of simple answers to these incredibly complex and interconnected  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:22):**  issues.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:23):**  On the whole, the basic premise of the film that overfishing is the biggest threat to  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:27):**  oceans, that there's a dramatic decline in species, there's an increase in habitat destruction  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:32):**  and pollution, that they're all without doubt, and they were the key message.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:36):**  So this seaspiracy definitely raised awareness of the ocean's critical importance and the  
**[0:02:40-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:40):**  threats they face.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:41):**  And I guess at the end of the day, it was a guy that really cared, he was passionate  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:47):**  about the ocean and telling a story, which resonated and connected people with this really  
**[0:02:52-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:52):**  vital ecosystem.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:53):**  And I think that was really important.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:55):**  It was certainly a compelling film, wasn't it?  
**[0:02:57-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:02:57):**  The narrative was really clear and you kind of felt very emotional about it.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:00):**  I know one of the concerns that you had was around towards the end, he had a definition  
**[0:03:05-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:05):**  of sustainability, and it was quite an old definition.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:08):**  Yeah, I think it's towards the end of the film with the whale hunt.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:13):**  And Ellie says, I finally understood sustainability.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:16):**  It just meant that something could continue on and on forever, regardless of how much  
**[0:03:21-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:21):**  suffering.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:22):**  But I began to wonder whether sustainability was truly the right goal for how we took care  
**[0:03:25-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:25):**  of the ocean.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:26):**  I mean, this take on sustainability is something that can continue or be maintained.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:32):**  It's really quite an outdated one.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:34):**  And I think we have contemporary definitions, which all include some aspect of taking care  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:39):**  of people, animals, environment, and restoring ecological balance.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:44):**  And sustainability, it's really a journey of continuous improvement and evolution.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:48):**  And I don't think that we can expect that the best sustainability practices of today  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:52):**  are the same that we would want in five years' time.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:03:56):**  So for me, sustainability and food production, it has been regenerative and restorative.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:00):**  And I think it's actually necessary that we expect that the way our food is produced,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:05):**  provides a benefit to the climate, provides a benefit to biodiversity, can be used to  
**[0:04:09-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:09):**  restore habitats and have wider social benefits.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:12):**  It's not just about having a reduced impact on ecosystems.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:15):**  Ruth, when you first watched it, you said that you felt quite emotional watching the  
**[0:04:21-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:21):**  film.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:22):**  I wonder what you found most shocking or upsetting about it.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:24):**  I guess, Finlow, it's this constant thing that I've seen over the last 20-odd years,  
**[0:04:30-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:30):**  looking at these systems in the sea, mainly on land, but also quite a lot of sea systems.  
**[0:04:36-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:36):**  It's the scale of them.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:37):**  You know, the scale of them makes it impossible, in my experience, to really care for people,  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:44):**  animals and the environment.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:46):**  And I watched Sea Spirits, myself, and the film highlights some of those issues around  
**[0:04:50-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:50):**  people and animals and the environment so well.  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:04:54):**  So yeah, it's just how can we really have these massive systems and care?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:00):**  So bottom trawling, for example, how can we bottom trawl and care for the seabed?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:04):**  It's not possible.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:05):**  And it feels, it's really why I've done what I did through my working life.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:09):**  It's really this lack of respect for life itself.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:12):**  And we intuitively know that it's not right to grab all this food from the sea and from  
**[0:05:17-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:17):**  the land and not respect it.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:19):**  It's interesting, isn't it?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:20):**  Because when you're talking about the way that bottom trawling in particular happens,  
**[0:05:25-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:25):**  it makes me think, you know, that this is something which is essentially invisible.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:30):**  If we see cows in a field on a farm, you know, that are looking unkempt and badly treated,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:35):**  if they're looking dirty, we can see that and respond to it.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:38):**  But in these great big systems that you mentioned, whether they're out at sea and they're invisible,  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:44):**  or whether they're in great big sheds and essentially it's invisible, it's a step removed  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:49):**  from human consciousness.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:50):**  And that kind of, that must be a problem.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:52):**  Yes.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:53):**  It's an intuitive thing that we know when we see it, when we see that massive action,  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:05:59):**  waste, it's an intuitive thing as a human being that we know it's not right.  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:04):**  Everybody at some level, I would say, knows it's not right.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:08):**  The question is, what do we do and how can we all contribute to that?  
**[0:06:12-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:12):**  Because blaming doesn't solve anything.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:14):**  So we all have a responsibility and a part to play in the solutions.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:18):**  In the world that we live in now, everything has scaled.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:22):**  Scale is fundamental to the way that we live our lives.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:25):**  Is it possible to change that?  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:27):**  The scale that you talk about, is it possible to come back from there?  
**[0:06:30-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:30):**  Well, yes, of course it's possible.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:32):**  I mean, we've had, throughout history, it's very interesting for me, throughout history,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:37):**  we've had a different type of system.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:39):**  We started farming something like 10, 12,000 years ago.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:43):**  And it's only in the last maximum 100 years, less than that really, that we've developed  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:47):**  these huge, huge systems with our so-called modern technology.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:52):**  And if we apply our brains and our modern technology, we can actually move through this,  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:06:57):**  what I feel is a dreadful phase really, in terms of people, animals and the environment,  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:02):**  through into something better.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:03):**  And as I said before, we can all contribute to that and we all have a responsibility to  
**[0:07:08-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:08):**  contribute to that.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:09):**  The easy thing to do is to blame somebody else.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:11):**  We all play a part and we all eat food.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:14):**  It's almost like it's an angry adolescence that the food system has been going through.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:19):**  This scaling and just plundering is gradually being questioned by more and more people.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:24):**  And obviously in terms of the conversations that we've been having on the podcast and  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:28):**  that you've been having throughout your working life about the introduction of agroecological  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:32):**  systems is the start of growing up a little bit as a food system.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:36):**  Ruth, one of the recurring themes in the film is transparency, which I guess is what we  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:41):**  were touching on in terms of things that are under the sea or they're in big sheds, they're  
**[0:07:46-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:46):**  out of sight and out of mind.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:47):**  And labels help to deliver some of that transparency.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:51):**  I mean, we don't quite get to that point where you can look over a hedge and you can see  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:07:55):**  the cows that are being mistreated in a particular field, but they're the best we have.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:00):**  And so labels like Dolphin Friendly or Marine Stewardship Council MSC certified, which were  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:05):**  the ones that, you know, Ali was focusing on in Sea Spiracy.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:09):**  What role do you think that labels can play in delivering greater sustainability?  
**[0:08:14-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:14):**  It's a real challenge.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:15):**  And all I want to say really is I feel it's great that they exist because people are,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:20):**  many, many people are genuinely trying to do something positive here, but we need to  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:25):**  evolve.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:27):**  And this evolution is really necessary.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:29):**  Now, we have some great technology which we're not making use of currently.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:34):**  You know, I've got good examples in the agriculture side of technology that we could use.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:39):**  And I think we could apply that same approach to the marine environment, both for wild-caught  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:44):**  and aquaculture.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:46):**  So I think it's an area to explore because the danger really is that people will move  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:51):**  en masse away from fish as they've moved away from meat.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:54):**  And then, you know, we're just transferring the problem.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:08:57):**  The issue is to really try to understand and make our best decision.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:01):**  And labels can play a part in that.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:03):**  The technology needs to be used more widely.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:06):**  It's difficult for a lot of people, isn't it?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:07):**  Because a lot of the time, you know, we'll sort of, you know, talk about the importance  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:11):**  of direct sales, of people being able to buy, perhaps through cooperatives where, you know,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:16):**  the particular standards associated with that farm species are assured in some way that  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:20):**  people can trust and that people have taken the time to actively search out that food.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:25):**  But for most people, they're still buying food in, you know, in big retail settings,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:30):**  certainly, you know, in Western countries.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:32):**  And so labels must be pretty critical.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:34):**  I mean, the labels that I would point people to would be organic would be one example.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:40):**  I think fair trade would be another example in terms of people.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:44):**  And again, you know, they don't cover everything and they're not perfect, but they are a start.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:50):**  And when people like myself and others challenge these leading labels, if you like, it's not  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:09:56):**  because we think the labels don't have a role, it's because we know that there are places  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:00):**  where the labels could improve.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:03):**  And it's not so much, it's partly in the standards, but it's more about exactly what the film  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:07):**  raised to how do we verify the label is working, if you like.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:12):**  So an example I'd like to give would be if, you know, many people will have watched the  
**[0:10:17-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:17):**  film Kiss the Ground, which is a similar sort of thing in a way for land-based.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:21):**  And it's very obvious there that we can use modern technology to see when we've got massive  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:27):**  levels of carbon dioxide coming into the atmosphere.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:30):**  We can see when that's happening and it's linked to the type of agriculture and disturbance  
**[0:10:34-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:34):**  of the Earth's crust.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:35):**  Well, maybe there's a similar thing that we can do for the seabed.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:38):**  I don't know.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:39):**  I haven't looked hard enough myself at the moment.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:42):**  And it's an area I'd certainly like to explore more.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:44):**  And I guess when you talk about technology, there's the option to the way that people  
**[0:10:48-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:48):**  farm to be put on Instagram or Twitter and for those farmers to have regular contact  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:10:55):**  with their customers in that way to demonstrate, you know, the good that they're doing.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:00):**  And there's a degree to which we could see a lot more of that happening, you know, out  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:04):**  in terms of ocean fishing at any rate, which still to a large extent for many of us is  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:09):**  something that happens over there.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:12):**  Ash, one of the possible solutions to overfishing is regenerative ocean farming.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:17):**  And we're going to come to that in a little while.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:19):**  But just before we do, I wonder if you could outline some of the key challenges with global  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:24):**  aquaculture as we understand it today.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:26):**  Yeah, so the key challenges for aquaculture, they're really the same as we have for agriculture,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:32):**  you know, around the inputs that are required in terms of feed, medicines, use, the pollution  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:37):**  associated with large numbers of animals in one space and the conditions for those animals.  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:42):**  You know, for carnivorous species of fish like salmon, sea bass, sea bream and crustaceans  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:48):**  such as shrimp, they need a high proportion of protein in their diet, which comes from  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:11:54):**  either soy, which of course is associated with deforestation or from wild caught fish.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:00):**  And many of these fisheries are in Southeast Asia, where we don't know much about the sustainability  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:05):**  of the stocks and as sea sphericity raised, you know, there's human rights issues of the  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:09):**  workers on the boats.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:11):**  The other aspect of course is animal welfare.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:13):**  When you have large numbers of animals in very confined spaces, you've got problems  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:17):**  with infectious disease, high use of medicines to combat these, high mortality rates, animals  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:23):**  are kept in conditions which can be stressful and restricts their natural behaviours.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:26):**  You've got water pollution in and around sea cages and ponds coming from animal feed and  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:32):**  waste.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:33):**  Lastly, as we were talking about before, when we catch and harvest the fish or crustaceans,  
**[0:12:38-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:38):**  there's issues with how humane the slaughter process is.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:42):**  I think it would be unfair to say that the industry is not aware of these challenges  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:47):**  and that, you know, there's been quite a lot of work, hasn't there, to try and resolve  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:51):**  some of these issues.  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:52):**  Yes, there has been a lot of work to resolve some of these issues and, you know, sustainability  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:12:58):**  strategies are inherent in many of the aquaculture companies that are producing a lot of these  
**[0:13:03-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:03):**  species.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:04):**  I guess I would say that they tend to veer towards the reducing impacts side of things.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:11):**  So trying to reduce the amount of wild caught fish that is in the feed, trying to certify  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:17):**  where the soy comes from, trying to limit the amounts of pollution.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:23):**  We're not sort of really fundamentally changing the way these systems operate.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:27):**  There are more tweaks around the system and we're still scaling up to a large degree and  
**[0:13:32-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:32):**  producing more and more animals in these systems.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:35):**  There's also the issue of sentience, isn't there, which is kind of the cornerstone of  
**[0:13:39-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:39):**  science around the welfare of farmed species.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:43):**  And a lot of people grow up with the idea that fish have short memories and, you know,  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:49):**  they don't particularly feel pain in the same way that other animals do.  
**[0:13:54-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:54):**  That's not right, is it?  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:55):**  No.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:56):**  They have a central nervous system.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:13:59):**  We know that they experience pain, that they can experience suffering.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:03):**  And we have a duty of care in farming these animals to provide them with the environments  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:09):**  that meet their wellbeing and provide them with positive experiences.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:13):**  And so if we think about slaughter, slaughter is a good example.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:17):**  When we're talking about fish by and large, they're being taken out of the sea, they're  
**[0:14:21-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:21):**  just suffocating, they're drowning in the air.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:24):**  And aquaculture does better than that, I think.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:26):**  There's been a lot of development over the years in killing fish.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:30):**  So I think we need to distinguish between fin fish and other fish.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:34):**  So fin fish are the most sentient fish, if you like, although there is evidence that  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:38):**  other fish or the fish species have sentience and octopus is the obvious example.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:44):**  So there are methodologies that have been developed to stun fish, yes, but you have  
**[0:14:49-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:49):**  to stun them as, you know, individual fish.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:52):**  And many people have worked hard to try and develop those systems and they do work to  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:56):**  a degree they're not always applied.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:14:59):**  That's the truth of the matter.  
**[0:15:00-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:00):**  They're not always applied.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:01):**  In terms of ocean caught fish, of course, then they're not stunned or anything before  
**[0:15:05-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:05):**  they're slaughtered.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:06):**  They are just merely taken from the sea and then they suffocate eventually.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:10):**  Yeah, that's what happens.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:11):**  That's the reality.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:12):**  So it's a very, very different system to all of the animals that we, you know, that we're  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:16):**  used to eating on land, you know, that we're used to in terms of a farm species.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:20):**  It's a very different approach to the way that the food is harvested and then the way  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:25):**  that those animals are slaughtered and brought to our table.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:29):**  So it is a very different system and one that clearly, you know, there needs to be more  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:33):**  transparency around and a lot more technical innovation.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:36):**  I wonder, Ruth, whether it's possible to overcome some of these sustainability challenges, particularly  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:41):**  in aquaculture, without a fundamental shift in what people eat in people's diets.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:46):**  No is the short answer.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:48):**  It's the same, you know, again, we can easily apply the same process, if you like, to how  
**[0:15:54-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:54):**  we've applied it on land.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:15:55):**  So one of the things that I think has happened is that we know that the consumption of fish  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:00):**  has massively increased in recent years.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:03):**  Part of that will be because people have made a shift from land animal protein, if you like,  
**[0:16:07-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:07):**  to fish protein.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:09):**  And we can't keep drawing on these resources because it's not a bottomless pit.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:15):**  And we could see that, you know, the film clearly shows that.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:17):**  We can argue about the detail of the figures, but the film clearly shows the, you know,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:21):**  the drop in the number of species and the effects that we're having and the balance  
**[0:16:25-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:25):**  that's needed to maintain a healthy sea.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:28):**  So it's that simple, it's that simple adage which came out of the Farming Smarter report  
**[0:16:34-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:34):**  from the FFCC.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:35):**  And they said, basically, eat less and better, more and better.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:40):**  So if you're going to eat animal protein, eat less of it and try and make sure that  
**[0:16:45-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:45):**  you eat it from a better system.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:47):**  Like I say, organic might be one system you would point to.  
**[0:16:50-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:50):**  Fair trade labels might be another system that you would point to.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:54):**  And more and better of all, everything else.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:16:57):**  But that includes your fruit, your vegetables, your grains.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:00):**  You've got to eat better, not just more of it.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:02):**  You have to eat better because there's plenty of those systems that impact animals, people,  
**[0:17:07-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:07):**  environment, use chemicals, etc.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:09):**  It's complicated.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:10):**  It's not simple.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:11):**  It's not just a case of saying, oh, I've discovered that chicken is bad and therefore I'm going  
**[0:17:15-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:15):**  to go and change what I eat and I'm just going to eat as much as I did before, but it's going  
**[0:17:19-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:19):**  to be fish this time.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:20):**  And so the less message is important, but more important within that is the better.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:25):**  It's trying to source better.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:27):**  And of course, you know, those labels that we were talking about earlier on are trying  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:31):**  in their own way to address that.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:33):**  People are told that red meat's bad and they move to white meat, then they're told that  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:37):**  white meat's bad, not just for their diet.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:40):**  I mean, in the rounds, you know, for animals and the people operating the systems.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:45):**  So they go from red meat to white meat to fish.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:48):**  And now we're saying fish is not great either.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:50):**  And then if we get that message across, some of us are going to say, well, you know, be  
**[0:17:54-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:54):**  careful about what vegetables and grains you eat because they're not all brilliant either  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:17:57):**  and can really negatively impact the environment and wild animals, etc.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:01):**  So this is not a simple solution.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:04):**  It's like Ash keeps saying, we have to focus on are we polluting?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:09):**  Are we putting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:11):**  Are we destroying our environment in the broader sense?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:15):**  And we need some clear messages so people can eat better.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:18):**  However they choose to eat, whether they choose to eat meat or fish or become vegetarian or  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:23):**  vegan, how you eat is really important and the system through which your food is produced.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:28):**  Can I just add one more thing, Finlow?  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:30):**  The pollution of the seas.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:31):**  I don't think we've mentioned this so far, but I think it's an important point.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:35):**  The pollution of the seas, a big chunk of that comes from the land.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:39):**  This is not all about people at sea causing the problem.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:42):**  A lot of the pollution is from our activities on the land.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:45):**  Ash, you've spent time researching indigenous communities and the way that they harvest  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:51):**  food from the ocean.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:52):**  I wonder what you discovered, you know, in that process of research and whether there  
**[0:18:56-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:56):**  were common themes that you came across.  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:18:58):**  Yeah, we were looking at how we could apply this concept of regenerative agriculture to  
**[0:19:03-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:03):**  seafood.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:04):**  So it's coming at it from a different angle than the technology aspect that Ruth mentioned  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:09):**  before with the labels.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:11):**  You know, we were interested in what and how indigenous and traditional cultures harvested  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:15):**  food from the ocean and their methods of aquaculture.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:18):**  So, you know, what could we learn?  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:20):**  So for indigenous peoples, this related primarily to ocean or stream fishing.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:25):**  And by indigenous, I mean cultures that existed pre-c  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:28):**  colonially and have maintained this cultural identity.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:33):**  The key common themes that came from that were the first and most obvious one for me  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:38):**  was the spiritual connection, the sense of reverence for the ocean and the food that  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:43):**  provides this sort of sacred, integral connection to this ecosystem, not a separation of humans  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:49):**  in this ecosystem, an integral connection.  
**[0:19:52-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:19:52):**  The second is that the decisions on what, when and where to fish are made by a chief  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:00):**  or an elder who has the entire community's wellbeing in mind.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:04):**  So it's not individualistic.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:06):**  And that status tends to be conferred by how well the community is doing and how that resource  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:12):**  has been managed.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:13):**  It's not about how much wealth has been accumulated.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:16):**  Thirdly is the adaptability and the ability to be really selective.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:21):**  So the species and even the age of what was being caught in a varies by the time of year  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:27):**  and the methods vary with the species in the time of year.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:30):**  So almost all methods, they allow for, you know, targeted type and size of species to  
**[0:20:36-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:36):**  be selected.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:37):**  And I think this adaptability provides us a certain amount of resiliency.  
**[0:20:42-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:42):**  So for example, if the weather makes fishing trips dangerous, or if a normal fishing or  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:46):**  harvesting spot doesn't provide as expected, you have the adaptability to move to a different  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:51):**  species or a different size of species.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:54):**  It's interesting as you say that, not necessarily the spiritual element, but certainly that  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:20:59):**  sort of trying to, you know, having a chief that is making decisions for the broader,  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:05):**  wider community and trying to think about which species should be caught and which species  
**[0:21:10-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:10):**  shouldn't.  
**[0:21:11-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:11):**  There's a lot there that would be underpinning the common fisheries policy of the European  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:16):**  Union.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:17):**  You effectively have a chief, you have the commission that has made these decisions on  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:21):**  behalf of the European community, but it doesn't work at scale.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:26):**  No, and I think that has something to do with this community size.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:31):**  The social scientist is Robin Dunbar, and he has this number of 150, above which he  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:38):**  says that communities start to break down, our relationships with each other start to  
**[0:21:43-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:43):**  break down.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:44):**  And that is something to do with our mental capacity to hold relationships and to remember  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:49):**  people and to form meaningful connections with people.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:53):**  And of course, we've got very complicated fisheries relationships, don't we?  
**[0:21:57-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:21:57):**  And you know, which fishing vessels are allowed where and which aren't and quotas and all  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:02):**  that sort of thing, which feeds into the complication.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:04):**  So again, we come back to that issue of scale.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:07):**  It can work when people have a good knowledge, when they have a certain reverence for what  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:11):**  they're doing, when they care about the species and when they care about the people they're  
**[0:22:15-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:15):**  employing.  
**[0:22:16-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:16):**  And that gets much, much harder as you scale, you know, and certainly when you're up at  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:20):**  a kind of a multi-country level like the European Union, there are always going to be, I mean,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:25):**  it's not just the discards of the fish, but discards of communities that are offset against  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:30):**  the benefits of other communities elsewhere.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:32):**  I wonder if you're able to sort of talk through one or two of the fishing systems that you  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:37):**  came across when you were doing that work, you know, looking at indigenous communities  
**[0:22:41-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:41):**  and the way that they fish.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:42):**  I guess the two examples I can give is one around Polynesian islands and Pacific islands,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:48):**  they tend to operate on a sort of a balanced harvest type approach.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:53):**  So that's using a wide variety of methods.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:22:55):**  So, you know, there'll be nets, harpooning, collecting shellfish from the shores, and  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:03):**  they will adapt whatever tool that they need and techniques that they need to use for the  
**[0:23:08-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:08):**  species in the time of year.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:10):**  You know, it's about using what you catch and balancing that out with what you're seeing  
**[0:23:16-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:16):**  in the environment at the time.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:18):**  So if you're not seeing large numbers of schools of fish in an area that you might normally  
**[0:23:23-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:23):**  be seeing, then you might target something else.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:25):**  One of the key things I'm taking from there is the issue of waste.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:29):**  It sounds like there's very little or no waste in these sort of indigenous community fishing  
**[0:23:35-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:35):**  systems.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:36):**  Yeah, that was my impression as well.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:37):**  So, you know, everything was used from the animal itself to the skins, and it all had  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:43):**  a purpose, you know, and it could be harvested and dried for, you know, winter months as  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:48):**  well.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:49):**  Do you think that there are things that Western communities can learn from these other communities  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:54):**  when we're thinking about fishing at a global scale?  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:57):**  Oh, completely.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:23:58):**  Yeah, I think all the things that I mentioned, you know, before, and then maybe the key ones  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:04):**  for me that would be driving change are this sense of connection to and reverence for the  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:09):**  oceans.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:10):**  And that can include the land as well.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:12):**  Thinking about the way we produce and harvest food as part of an ecosystem and the variation  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:18):**  requiring selectivity and adaptability.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:21):**  So we take what we need and not what we can.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:24):**  Ruth, we've worked together on scaling agroecology for several years, and I wonder if you think  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:29):**  it's possible for fisheries to take some of the same agroecological journey that we've  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:33):**  been working to accelerate on the land.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:35):**  Yes, it's a simple answer.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:37):**  And you know, I'm looking at this with people like Ash and obviously yourself, and I think  
**[0:24:42-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:42):**  there is a way forward.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:44):**  It just needs, it needs serious focus and attention and people that really, really want  
**[0:24:50-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:50):**  to do it.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:51):**  You know, we said a lot in this podcast about community and the experience I have of society  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:24:58):**  is that it is very difficult to maintain a community feeling and experience, if you like,  
**[0:25:05-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:05):**  when we operate these large systems.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:07):**  This is not a blame statement.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:08):**  This is a fact.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:09):**  It's just because the people that are running those systems at the senior level are not  
**[0:25:14-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:14):**  connected to what's happening on the ground.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:16):**  And therefore the pain of it does not register so strongly with them.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:20):**  And of course, we can all be part of that because we are investing in these companies,  
**[0:25:24-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:24):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:25):**  It's a radical change that's needed in the world.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:29):**  If human beings are to stay on the planet, it is as simple as that, really.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:33):**  If we don't change, we will not survive as a species.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:36):**  It sounds a radical statement, but the evidence is clear.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:40):**  I think that brings us on to the idea of regenerative ocean farming.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:43):**  And, you know, we've talked about this a couple of times.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:46):**  I've mentioned the phrase, and I wonder, Ash, if you could just help people out by describing  
**[0:25:51-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:51):**  what we mean when we talk about regenerative ocean farming.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:54):**  Would you give us a sense of what that means?  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:25:57):**  It's farming in a way that restores or regenerates the ocean.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:01):**  So by that, I mean the water quality, the marine habitat, the biodiversity, sequesters  
**[0:26:07-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:07):**  carbon.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:08):**  It's producing and harvesting food in a way that has a benefit where we aren't just trying  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:13):**  to lessen our impact, but we're trying to do more good from that food production.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:17):**  And the basis of regenerative ocean farming is the polyculture of seaweeds, seagrasses  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:23):**  and shellfish.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:24):**  The seaweed is an important underwater habitat for a variety of other fish and crustaceans.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:30):**  So it helps restore the marine ecosystem.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:33):**  It can reduce storm surges.  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:36):**  And as I said, it can sequester large amounts of carbon.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:39):**  And both the kelp and the sea shellfish can act as water filters to help improve water  
**[0:26:45-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:45):**  quality.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:46):**  And one of the keys to restorative or regenerative ocean farming is that no feed or other inputs  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:53):**  are needed and you have a high yield of both seaweed and shellfish.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:26:57):**  One of the most cited examples of regenerative ocean farming is Thimble Island Farms, which  
**[0:27:03-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:03):**  is on the east coast of the United States.  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:06):**  They farm kelp, scallops, mussels, clams, and then they establish this not for profit  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:12):**  called Greenwave, where they help to train and finance other restorative ocean farmers.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:17):**  I think they've trained around 120 at the moment and they're aiming for 10,000.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:22):**  I guess, coming back to the scale issue that Ruth was talking about before.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:27):**  So this is scale, but it's not scaling up in terms of having one ever bigger farm.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:33):**  It's about a lot of farmers doing the same thing up and down the coast.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:37):**  So it's scaling by replication as opposed to scaling by increasing in size.  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:41):**  Obviously, we've just been talking about regenerative ocean farming in the United States.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:45):**  Are there other examples of that kind of approach to ocean farming elsewhere in the world?  
**[0:27:51-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:51):**  Well, it's actually polyculture ocean farming.  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:54):**  So that's where you've got two species in one space together.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:27:59):**  It's actually quite common, particularly in Southeast Asia.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:02):**  It's usually on a household or the local village scale, and they use a variety of different  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:08):**  species.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:09):**  But we don't actually have much data about the environmental impacts of those systems  
**[0:28:13-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:13):**  and whether they're having a restorative impact or not.  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:16):**  But they do exist.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:18):**  Many of them do exist.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:19):**  So it's not just taking place in places in the West like in the United States.  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:24):**  It is happening at a large scale in other parts of the world.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:29):**  We just don't necessarily have the data.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:31):**  Mason, it's interesting what you talk about there.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:32):**  It sounds like quite a utopian way of approaching seafood.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:36):**  But when you were describing that, you're talking about kelp and obviously finding a  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:41):**  market for the kelp, and you're talking about shellfish.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:44):**  And shellfish, they're an acquired taste for a lot of people.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:48):**  They're very different to the type of fish that many people would choose if they were  
**[0:28:52-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:52):**  out in the supermarket.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:53):**  Yes.  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:54):**  Well, I think that's one of the key challenges.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:28:56):**  To create that demand so that the farmers want to farm regeneratively in the ocean and  
**[0:29:02-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:02):**  that it's profitable for them.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:04):**  We need to shift the way we eat, and we need to eat further down the food chain.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:09):**  So these kind of species like salmon and shrimp, we need to be eating down the food chain in  
**[0:29:15-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:15):**  less of these higher traffic species.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:17):**  But that behavioral change is tough.  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:19):**  That's not an easy route to take.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:22):**  It is possible to process shellfish into things like fish fingers and that kind of stuff,  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:27):**  which might make it much more palatable for people in a sort of transitional sense.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:32):**  And I guess that's the alternative to what Ali was mentioning in the SeaSpiracy is these  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:38):**  plant-based alternatives to meat.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:42):**  And possibly one of the alternatives that we consider is shellfish alternatives to these  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:49):**  processed foods.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:50):**  When you were talking about regenerative ocean farming and the way that it sort of works  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:54):**  in this, it's a community that's being built in the sea of kelp and shellfish that are  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:29:59):**  suspended in cages and that sort of thing, rather than being on the sea floor so they  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:04):**  don't need to be dredged up.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:05):**  That sounds like an approach.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:07):**  It's not an approach that's happening in the deep ocean, is it?  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:10):**  It's something that's happening in coastal regions, presumably it's something that could  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:13):**  take place in a marine nature reserve in the same way that it happens anywhere else, because  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:19):**  it would be contributing to marine life around it.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:23):**  And what was being grown and extracted would be entirely controlled within that system  
**[0:30:28-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:28):**  itself.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:29):**  Yes, absolutely.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:30):**  I think it would suit marine protected areas.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:33):**  And a lot of those marine protected areas are in coastal regions or within the exclusive  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:37):**  economic zones of countries anyway.  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:39):**  Do you think there were any other sort of challenges to scaling this approach to ocean  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:44):**  food?  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:45):**  In the same way that it is for regenerative agriculture, it is for the farmers of regenerative  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:50):**  ocean farming.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:51):**  It's a mindset change.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:53):**  It's thinking in terms of ecosystem cycles and increasing that nutrient loop.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:30:58):**  It's a fundamental shift from the extractive approach that we have of wild caught fishing  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:04):**  or these high input systems that we've developed for aquaculture.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:08):**  And it's challenging to adopt new ways of farming or similar methods from different  
**[0:31:12-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:12):**  cultures.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:13):**  These systems that we've developed with so-called modern technology, which it is modern technology,  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:19):**  it's the way it's applied, are not that old in terms of our history as humanity and certainly  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:25):**  our farming history.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:26):**  They're barely 100 years old.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:28):**  And we've done a lot of damage in a very short space of time, which is why Ash has talked  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:33):**  about the classic sustainability definition.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:37):**  We need to be more regenerative.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:39):**  We can't carry on doing what we're doing now because we're on a depletion cycle at the  
**[0:31:43-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:43):**  moment.  
**[0:31:44-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:44):**  Things are getting worse year on year.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:45):**  And the evidence for that is massive.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:47):**  This is why many of us talk about regenerative systems.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:50):**  In my view, we don't have an option.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:52):**  If we want to stay on the planet as a species, we have to do something regenerative.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:57):**  And that again means all of us.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:31:59):**  I just want to keep emphasizing this because people want to say, retailers should do this,  
**[0:32:04-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:04):**  the farmers should do this, people should do this.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:07):**  Each of us as individuals can do something, can do something and we all need to play our  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:12):**  part if we're going to be successful.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:14):**  The planet will survive, human beings may not.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:17):**  And it will be pretty messy now for a lot of people.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:20):**  And it can only get worse unless we do something different.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:23):**  And there's such joy in doing something different.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:25):**  I think that's the other thing I want to say.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:27):**  There's complete and utter joy when you see these systems starting to operate and the  
**[0:32:31-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:31):**  people involved and the animals involved.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:33):**  There's great joy in it.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:35):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:36):**  I think that's great to have a positive note to end on there.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/What-next-for-ocean-food-ev9npo#t=0:32:39):**  Well, that's all we have time for.

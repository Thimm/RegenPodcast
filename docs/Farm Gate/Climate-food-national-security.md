### Farm Gate  (Sat, 29 Feb 2020 17:38:20)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. It's widely accepted that climate change  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:11):**  can have an impact on food availability in developing countries, and that these impacts  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:16):**  can act on existing vulnerabilities and threats, and lead to conflict. But what about developed  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:21):**  nations? Countries like the United Kingdom or the United States of America? Could our  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:26):**  own food availability be threatened by climate change? Could the complexity of our supply  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:30):**  chains make us more vulnerable than we realise? And could future food scarcity mean that existing,  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:37):**  but largely latent, social tensions begin to fracture?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:41):**  Do we think that we're not vulnerable? Do you think it's only in developing countries  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:45):**  that you have climate risks? And the answer is absolutely not. The US, the UK, we are  
**[0:00:50-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:50):**  vulnerable.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:51):**  We'd be living in a pretty challenging world. I think we face the risks of not just an uncomfortable  
**[0:00:57-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:00:57):**  world, we'd also have a world of uncertainty. Uncertainty about where our food's going  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:01):**  to come from, whether our imports, our trade is going to flow. And I think it would become  
**[0:01:05-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:05):**  a pretty techy world as well in the process. So we really have got to do something about  
**[0:01:09-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:09):**  it.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:10):**  In this programme, I'll speak to Caitlin Wherill, the co-founder of the Washington-based  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:15):**  think tank, the Centre for Climate and Security, which works with the Pentagon and advises  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:20):**  the US government. And I'll talk to Rear Admiral Neil Morissette, the UK's former  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:25):**  climate energy and security envoy and former special representative for climate change.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:31):**  Global warming, leading to food shortages and insecurity, increased poverty and climate-related  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:36):**  migration will emphasise existing inequalities in developed nations and could act alongside  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:42):**  other social undercurrents to build greater resentments and increase the threat of civil  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:48):**  unrest. As the world continues to warm, the resilience of our crops and food infrastructure  
**[0:01:54-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:01:54):**  could mean the difference between a civilisation that continues to thrive and a broken society  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:00):**  in which communities are forced to defend food supplies from other citizens.  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:05):**  I have a fear that by 2060, when my children are about the age that I am now, if we continue  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:11):**  on current warming trajectories, then people not only in developing countries, but those  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:16):**  living in mature democracies and economies such as the UK and the USA could be facing  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:22):**  severe disruptions to food supplies, water and nutrition. I asked Neil Morissette whether  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:28):**  he thinks I'm right to worry.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:31):**  Neil Morissette Yeah, I think you are because, I mean, the  
**[0:02:33-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:33):**  causes of conflict are multiple and there's a myriad of factors that come to bear in why  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:37):**  conflict or instability occurs in different places in different world, different communities  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:43):**  have different degrees of resilience to the challenges they face. But we know that at  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:46):**  a time when the world's population is still growing and the aspirations of those who are  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:50):**  on the planet are increasing, there's only a finite amount of food and water and land  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:55):**  available. And anything that adds to the pressure on that, perhaps because of the scarcity of  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:02:59):**  food or an imbalance, one area having too much, another having not enough, can only  
**[0:03:04-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:04):**  cause a degree of tension.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:05):**  Paul Edmondson So are we thinking that climate change can  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:09):**  directly lead to conflict or is it something that contributes, that sort of layers on top  
**[0:03:14-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:14):**  of other issues in order to lead to conflict? Is it one or the other or a combination?  
**[0:03:18-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:18):**  Neil Morissette Very much the latter. You can't rule out the  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:20):**  possibility of a war or a conflict being started solely by climate change, but that's pretty  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:24):**  unlikely. But as an accelerant or a threat multiplier, then I think it is much more likely.  
**[0:03:30-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:30):**  And it's a bit like, I mean, it's like throwing a bucket of petrol on a smouldering fire. It  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:34):**  will inflame the situation, it will cause challenges and in some communities may result  
**[0:03:40-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:40):**  in conflict or just instability.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:42):**  Paul Edmondson People talk about society being nine meals  
**[0:03:46-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:46):**  from anarchy, which puts food right at the heart of the potential for society to break  
**[0:03:53-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:53):**  down. How important do you think that food is?  
**[0:03:57-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:57):**  Neil Morissette Yeah, I mean, nine meals and probably two  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:03:59):**  days of water away from, not necessarily anarchy, but certainly instability and rising tensions  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:06):**  and different countries, different communities, different degrees of resilience. But even  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:10):**  in a developed world, I think our pain threshold is quite low in these sort of areas. And there's  
**[0:04:15-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:15):**  risks of people becoming vociferous or starting to complain or starting to look after themselves  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:21):**  if they are missing things that they've become used to or expecting to have, particularly  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:25):**  the staple things of food and water.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:26):**  Paul Edmondson Caitlin Weryl has spent more than a decade  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:30):**  assessing the security risks of climate change. She co-founded the Center for Climate and  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:34):**  Security in 2010. And she spoke to me following the launch of the first World Climate and  
**[0:04:39-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:39):**  Security Report.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:40):**  Caitlin Weryl The expert group of the International Military  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:43):**  Council on Climate Security, which is a group of senior military leaders, security experts  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:47):**  and security institutions from across the globe, just put out its first World Climate  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:51):**  and Security Report. It's a very extensive report. It looks at climate and security in  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:04:57):**  various different regions. What we found was that increasingly more and more militaries  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:02):**  are sounding the alarm on climate change. They're seeing how it's affecting their own  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:06):**  mission sets. But they're also calling on diplomacy and development civilian lead for  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:12):**  how we actually attack and deal with with climate security risks. One of the major survey  
**[0:05:17-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:17):**  findings was that 93% of those who were surveyed see that the likelihood of water insecurity  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:24):**  and by 2030 will pose a significant or higher risk to global security. And the way that  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:29):**  fits in with agriculture is fundamental that you need water to produce food. And so when  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:34):**  you have changes to water availability, and a lot of times we talk about water scarcity,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:39):**  there's a sense that it's just droughts, but it's actually also sometimes it's too much  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:43):**  water or and sometimes it's also just water variability where you have the greatest risk  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:48):**  to things like food security where you have a drought and a flood in succession. We're  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:52):**  also seeing more things when you do have water scarcity and it affects your food production.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:05:57):**  This can scale up into higher order risks. This is where you can have conflict, particularly  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:01):**  between ethnically fractured communities between farmers and herders. And so these are things  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:07):**  where you know, particularly with with the military expert network group, they say, we're  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:11):**  seeing this we're called more and more into various regions across the world to intervene  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:17):**  to do conflict prevention or to respond to places where you have things like food and  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:21):**  water insecurity that are are calling on the role of the military. And they said, you know,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:27):**  this isn't we need development and diplomacy to prevent this from becoming something that  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:32):**  we do have to intervene. Now, you mentioned there, you know, conflicts between ethnic  
**[0:06:36-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:36):**  groups and so on. I think, you know, when we're talking about climate change and food  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:40):**  and national security, there's a reasonable recognition that hotter countries, perhaps  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:45):**  countries that are already at drought risk, places where there is a higher instance of  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:50):**  subsistence agriculture, that those countries are, of course, vulnerable to climate change.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:06:56):**  But do you think in terms of developed countries like the USA, like the UK, that enough is  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:01):**  being done to identify not just the risks to food security, but also nutrition security  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:07):**  and all those risks similar in developed countries like our own in general, what you're getting  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:12):**  at. And I like your question, which is, do we think that we're not vulnerable? Do you  
**[0:07:17-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:17):**  think it's only in developing countries that you have climate risks? And the answer is  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:20):**  absolutely not. The US, the UK, we are we are vulnerable. We're seeing impacts. We're  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:24):**  seeing entire crops being destroyed by by flooding events and extreme weather events.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:31):**  And so I think that I have a frustration with some of these climate vulnerability maps where  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:35):**  you have things like Africa and the Sahel will be red and Middle East will be red and  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:41):**  very climate vulnerable. And then places like the most of Europe and the US will be colored  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:45):**  green. Like everything's just going to be fine, which is absolutely not the case. You  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:49):**  know, when we talk about climate change, we often talk about climate impacts. One of the  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:53):**  ones that we don't talk a lot about is health and health security. So that gets to your  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:07:57):**  nutrition aspect. I think we need to do a lot more to understand what these risks are  
**[0:08:01-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:01):**  going to be. You know, one of the things that we talk about is our responsibility to prepare  
**[0:08:05-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:05):**  and prevent. And this is if you look at climate risk, particularly compared to other risks,  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:11):**  we can see these risks coming. We have climate models that are developed in 1950 that are  
**[0:08:16-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:16):**  still largely accurate. If you compare this to the political, you couldn't have predicted  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:21):**  the political environment today. And so we really need to do whether it's food security,  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:26):**  water security, nutrition, health, anything that we can model and say, okay, this is there's  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:30):**  a very high likelihood and a high probability that this is the future that we're facing.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:35):**  We need to start planning for that future. And by doing that, then you have greater probability,  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:41):**  better policies in place. That's essentially what we mean by climate proofing. The whole  
**[0:08:45-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:45):**  world has already shifted and changed. We're already living in the climate change world.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:48):**  It's just describing the future world and how that's going to continue to change. I  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:52):**  think one thing that's really important and fundamental to talk about is how these changes  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:08:56):**  are unprecedented for human civilization. And particularly when we're talking about  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:00):**  food security and agriculture. So if you look at the development of civilization, if you  
**[0:09:04-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:04):**  look at the development of agriculture from the very beginning, all of that occurred within  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:08):**  the Holocene. Then we had fluctuations and extreme weather events and things like that.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:13):**  But for the most part, there was this very kind of safe bubble in which civilization  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:16):**  advanced. If you look at the charts that say where we are within terms of carbon dioxide  
**[0:09:22-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:22):**  in the atmosphere, we've left that bubble. Some people are calling this the Anthropocene.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:26):**  And so all civilizations living in uncharted territories. So we talk about climate insecurity.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:31):**  What we're talking about is living in a world where there's a lot of unknowns. I have a  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:35):**  lot of concerns about agriculture because it's again, it's developed within this bubble  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:41):**  that we've left.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:42):**  Climate and security planning is about identifying and mitigating risk, accurately and honestly  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:49):**  considering worst case scenarios. To help with this, it's important to understand how  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:09:54):**  climate change can accelerate threats and fan the flames of existing tensions. I asked  
**[0:10:00-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:00):**  Neil Morissetti to explain the link between climate change, food and the Arab Spring.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:07):**  We saw in the beginning of the Arab Spring that one of the factors that contributed to  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:10):**  it was the riots in the markets in Tunisia, in part because of the price of bread. And  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:14):**  that bread had gone up in price because the year before in 2010, there had been a heatwave  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:18):**  in Russia, which meant that the wheat harvest was down. So less wheat was exported. Coincidentally,  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:24):**  in Australia and Canada, there was extreme wet weather, which resulted in smaller harvests.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:29):**  And all of that pushed the price of wheat up and therefore pushed the price of bread  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:33):**  up. So not the cause of the riots and instability, but one of the contributing factors perhaps  
**[0:10:38-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:38):**  that sort of tipped the balance.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:39):**  Again, in Syria, we know the prolonged drought in the first decade of this century resulted  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:45):**  in failed harvests, a lot of rural people moving to urban areas, put pressure on the  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:50):**  services and resources in those urban areas. It also accelerated some of the historical  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:54):**  tensions, some of which are religious. Again, a contributing factor to the conflict in that  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:58):**  country.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:10:59):**  So what's really interesting there is that there's a combination of sort of local factors  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:02):**  and global factors that are acting together.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:06):**  The reality is, with 7 billion on the planet today, with more as the population grows,  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:11):**  and there's a demand on the resources is getting greater and greater. And there's an imbalance  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:15):**  between those who have a surplus and those who have a short footage. But because we lived  
**[0:11:19-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:19):**  in this, we live in this joined up world, we see the effects right across the whole  
**[0:11:23-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:23):**  planet.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:24):**  One thing that it's important to do is not to suffer from a failure of imagination. We  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:28):**  really need to take time to think through all of these vulnerabilities, be it domestic  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:32):**  food production or global market, food market vulnerabilities. We need to think through  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:38):**  all the different possibilities of what could happen and plan and prepare for this. We also  
**[0:11:42-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:42):**  need to accept that some of these changes are already locked in. We have already released  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:46):**  emissions in the atmosphere that are some of which are going to stay. We've committed  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:51):**  ourselves to a certain future. The worst can be avoided if we reduce emissions now and  
**[0:11:56-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:56):**  quickly.  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:11:57):**  I think we need to understand we live in a global world. And then we talk about climate  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:00):**  change. These are it's an international risk. It's an international opportunity as well.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:05):**  And so like these risks, they don't recognize national boundaries, and neither do our decisions.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:10):**  And so part of it is just is just rethinking how we understand the climate change world  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:16):**  and how we live amongst it and how our decisions can, whether we realize it or not, impact  
**[0:12:22-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:22):**  people thousands of miles away.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:24):**  Planning to identify and mitigate risks associated with climate change requires leadership, which  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:30):**  under the current US administration presents a degree of challenge. I asked Caitlin Weryl  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:35):**  about the role leadership plays and where, when we're dealing with threats of this nature  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:40):**  and on this scale, that leadership needs to come from.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:44):**  Executive leadership absolutely does matter anywhere that that affects. But we are happy  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:49):**  to see that the military has continued to take this threat very seriously. The intelligence  
**[0:12:54-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:54):**  community has continued to take this threat very seriously across administrations. The  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:12:59):**  last at least 12 worldwide threat assessments by the intelligence community, including under  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:04):**  the US administration, has said that climate change is a security risk. There's just it's  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:08):**  a certain amount of you have to deal with the reality on the ground. And so but we are  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:14):**  encouraged also by seeing the international community step up quite a bit more. We're  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:18):**  seeing places like NATO, like the EU, Asia Pacific, where countries are increasingly  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:23):**  understanding how we need to be working together to prepare and prevent the worst of climate  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:29):**  security implications.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:30):**  World Finance and the US government have also said that the US government is not the only  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:34):**  country to be working together to prevent climate change. But to effectively mitigate the impacts  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:38):**  of climate change on local and global food supplies, we need to be able to understand  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:42):**  where our vulnerabilities may lie.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:45):**  If you take the UK, we import about 40% of our food. Some of the supply chains are particularly  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:52):**  complex. The sources of food are in regions which will be affected increasingly by the  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:13:58):**  impact of climate change, whether it's the onset of long-term trends or extreme weather  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:02):**  events. There's demand for that food from elsewhere, whether it's from the local population  
**[0:14:07-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:07):**  where it's grown, or other developed countries. Our resilience is perhaps weaker in some areas  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:13):**  as individuals, if we can't get what we want. Now, that doesn't mean we should grow everything  
**[0:14:17-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:17):**  in our own country, but we probably ought to look at trying to get the balance right.  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:20):**  And we certainly need to understand where the fragility is in the supply chain. It may  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:25):**  be because of the route it takes. We know that during the ash cloud issues at the beginning  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:29):**  of this decade, we were pretty close to running out of certain commodities on the shelves.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:34):**  And we've seen, as a result of the coronavirus, that our supply chains are very much just  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:38):**  enough just in time. And if there's disruption, then we start to lose it. Look at Australia  
**[0:14:43-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:43):**  and the bushfires at the moment. That is on a massive scale, and that has really stretched  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:47):**  the Australian firefighting community, the rescue services, and it's happening in an  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:50):**  area where they grow their wheat. So that will potentially have a bearing.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:54):**  So what you're saying is that the complexity of our supply chains, the length of them,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:14:59):**  the number of different breaks in that supply chain or potential breaks in the supply chain,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:04):**  actually potentially make us perhaps as vulnerable as some of those more developing nations,  
**[0:15:11-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:11):**  but in a different way? Yeah, I think we have resilience in ways  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:14):**  that some of those countries don't have, and we have the ability to act. But also, we have  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:17):**  greater demands on the world as a developed country and on the planet. And many of the  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:22):**  areas where we have the demands are, particularly in the context of food, are ones that will  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:27):**  be impacted by a changing climate. And if we sort of think of a scenario there,  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:31):**  maybe in 10 or 20 years' time when temperatures have risen perhaps another degree, then, you  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:39):**  know, if Britain was going hungry, then I think, as you've indicated, we could import  
**[0:15:43-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:43):**  some food from somewhere else. But if Britain was going hungry at the same time as France  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:47):**  was and Germany was, and there was conflict in the Suez Canal, then that becomes a real  
**[0:15:52-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:52):**  problem doesn't it? Yeah, and that's why I think we have to work  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:15:55):**  as nations to do two things. One, to try and remove the source of the problem, in other  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:01):**  words, to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions quite markedly so that there is less risk  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:05):**  of future climate change, but also acknowledge that there is climate change locked into the  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:09):**  system for the next 30 years, whatever we do, and we need to work together as nations  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:13):**  in order to mitigate those risks to the point at which they're manageable, to understand  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:18):**  not just the most likely risks, but the most challenging risks, to share knowledge, to  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:22):**  share technical expertise and understanding of how we will meet some of these challenges.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:26):**  And that means you have to work beyond just your own national boundaries.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:29):**  In the agricultural community, in the environmental community, there's a recognition that it's  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:34):**  not just climate change that is undermining our ability to produce food potentially in  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:39):**  the future, but also the crisis in biodiversity, in nature, the collapse in soil health that  
**[0:16:45-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:45):**  limits our capacity to even grow food in the future to have successful harvests. And in  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:51):**  that way, we could be facing a sort of perfect storm if we failed a couple of those actions.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:16:57):**  I wonder within the security community that you move in, whether biodiversity loss is  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:02):**  something which is starting to be discussed in the same way that climate change is already  
**[0:17:06-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:06):**  being discussed?  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:07):**  The conversation is very embryonic. It is just starting to be discussed. I think perhaps  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:12):**  as people learn more about the impact of climate change, and then start to hear more as experts  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:17):**  talk about the core challenges of biodiversity and understand you can't just carry on harvesting  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:23):**  the land year after year and expecting to get the same sort of yields. There is a growing  
**[0:17:27-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:27):**  awareness but it's pretty embryonic at the moment.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:30):**  One of the things I would say is the way in which we assess risk, the way in which we  
**[0:17:34-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:34):**  think about how much risk we can absorb, what we can withstand, what we prepare for. We  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:39):**  tend to think only in terms of one disaster. We think one hurricane or one major flood.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:44):**  And we say, sure, we'll be fine. We can recover from that. There's not a lot of thought given  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:50):**  to cascading disasters or multiple disasters in quick succession. And I think that this  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:54):**  is going to be a critical point in terms of understanding the vulnerability of places  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:17:59):**  like the United States. So if you have, we see an incredible amount of strain within  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:03):**  the last hurricane season where you have the National Guard going to help with disaster  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:08):**  recovery from the hurricane, but at the same time are being called out to the West to fight  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:13):**  wildfires. And so if you combine that with another major storm somewhere else in the  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:18):**  country, it's going to put strains on it that potentially you're going to have to make hard  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:22):**  choices. You're going to have to say, we simply can't respond in this instance because we  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:26):**  don't have the capacity to do so.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:28):**  We need to understand all the different points of vulnerability. And so right now, we see  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:32):**  this annually where you have some place like the US, the breadbaskets of the world. US  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:38):**  is in Russia. And unfortunately, there hasn't been a situation where simultaneously all  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:43):**  of these major food producing areas have been affected at the same time. But that's not  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:47):**  because it's impossible. So that's something where it doesn't matter where you are in the  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:51):**  world. If you are heavily dependent on the global food market and you see a major impact  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:18:57):**  across a lot of these food producing places, you're going to be affected. The other thing  
**[0:19:01-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:01):**  I think you mentioned that was really important to us is the supply chain and how it can break  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:05):**  down if you have supply routes and channels like the Suez Canal, but also in the US, the  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:12):**  Mississippi River is incredibly important for transporting goods. And so if you have  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:17):**  a climate impact on these places that break down, then that's also a vulnerability that  
**[0:19:23-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:23):**  you need to anticipate.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:24):**  It seems pretty clear that a lot more climate, food and security planning is needed at both  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:29):**  global and national levels. These plans must reach out beyond the traditional military  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:35):**  and civil security establishments and include farmers, retailers, importers, experts in  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:41):**  nutrition, health and infrastructure, as well as other critical civil society stakeholders.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:47):**  I asked Neil Morissetti and Caitlin Wherill what we should be expecting from our governments  
**[0:19:52-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:52):**  right now.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:53):**  They've got to start to develop a plan. But I think the most important thing is they've  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:19:58):**  got to engage with the public and they've got to be honest, easier said than done. We  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:02):**  live in a world which is pretty short term. The public is encouraged to believe they can  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:07):**  have what they want when they want an affordable price with limited risk. And the reality is  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:12):**  it's not going to be like that. We need to think more long term. We need to be prepared  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:15):**  to invest now in order to help future generations, acknowledging that actually the amount it's  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:21):**  going to cost now is pretty limited compared to what it would cost if we don't do anything.  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:26):**  And we need to be willing to work together both on a regional and sub-regional basis  
**[0:20:30-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:30):**  as much as on the international stage.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:33):**  Just finally, Neil, humour me a little. If we fail, I wonder if you could paint a picture  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:40):**  looking forward 40 years to when my kids, you know, around about my age, around 20,  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:47):**  60, if we fail in the UK or the USA to hold down global temperatures, if they continue  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:20:54):**  to rise in terms of worst case scenarios from the IPCC, if we fail to arrest the breakdown  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:00):**  in biodiversity, what could be the consequences for our society?  
**[0:21:05-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:05):**  We'd be living in a pretty challenging world. For some countries it would be too challenging  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:09):**  and parts of the world would certainly become uninhabitable, but there'll still be a population.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:13):**  I think we face the risks of not just an uncomfortable world because it's a warmer world and a warmer  
**[0:21:20-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:20):**  country. We'd also have a world with uncertainty, uncertainty about where our food's going to  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:24):**  come from, whether our imports, our trade is going to flow. We could find ourselves  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:29):**  having to deploy our military more often, perhaps on humanitarian operations, but also  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:35):**  in order to protect interests around the world. And I think it would become a pretty techy  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:39):**  world as well in the process. So we really have got to do something about it. But there's  
**[0:21:43-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:43):**  some real opportunities that we act now, whether they are in the sense of health, in the sense  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:47):**  of economic benefits, but also with co-benefits of improved stability and security around  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:53):**  the world, which makes me think that actually if we get this right, we can mitigate most  
**[0:21:58-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:21:58):**  of the risks. But it's challenging and we need to start now and we need to think long  
**[0:22:02-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:02):**  term.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:03):**  But if we don't manage to do that, do you think that we could be seeing a situation  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:07):**  where there is civil conflict in Britain?  
**[0:22:10-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:10):**  There will be tension. I wouldn't go so far as to say we'd see conflict in the country,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:15):**  but I think we would be very fragile. And if something happened elsewhere that disrupted  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:20):**  essential supplies to this country, then we really we would face a risk perhaps of some  
**[0:22:25-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:25):**  form of civil disobedience.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:28):**  But as you say, if we look and we plan and we have that honest conversation with society  
**[0:22:34-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:34):**  as a whole and government starts to take this this much more seriously, then we could plan  
**[0:22:40-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:40):**  to shorten our supply chains to reduce that vulnerability and over-dependence on other  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:46):**  parts of the world. We could take action to ensure that our farmland is more productive  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:51):**  than it is today and that we're able to face the more extreme weathers, droughts or flooding  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:22:57):**  that we're more likely to see as a result of climate change. Then we could find that  
**[0:23:01-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:01):**  we're actually in a much stronger position perhaps than we are even today.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:05):**  Yeah. And I think we should be striving to be more resilient because we're going to face  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:09):**  more challenges in the future. And what we learn from that, we need to be prepared to  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:13):**  share with other nations, both developed and developing, because of this because of this  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:18):**  joined up world that we live in. If we don't, we will experience the consequences of more  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:22):**  fragile societies collapsing just as much as they will where they are in the world.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:27):**  So to summarise, there's a threat. It's very real. So we need a plan. And if we get a plan,  
**[0:23:33-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:33):**  we'll be OK.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:34):**  There's a threat. It's real. We need to act. We should have started acting before. We certainly  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:38):**  need to start acting now. But we need to do it in a measured fashion. We need to think  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:42):**  it through. We need to understand what we're trying to achieve and how we're going to achieve  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:45):**  it. It involves all of us. But the opportunities make it worthwhile.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:49):**  We're at a very important moment in history where we're deciding what the future world  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:54):**  we live in looks like. And I think if we don't take the time now to prepare, to think about  
**[0:23:59-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:23:59):**  this world, to really put in place climate-proofing policies, to understand the risks that we  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:06):**  face, then we're potentially facing a future of hard choices where there just aren't good  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:12):**  opportunities available and choices where you potentially have authoritarian responses  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:18):**  to these. This is the kind of issue that keeps me up at night is when you have a breakdown  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:24):**  of governance, when you have a breakdown of the ability to put in place protections for  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:32):**  people for the most vulnerable, when you lean towards building walls versus helping people  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:39):**  move out of harm's way. We have a moment now where we can put in place  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:44):**  humanitarian policies, where we can work together to agree that this is the best for the most  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:49):**  people. And I hope that we use this opportunity to do so. I hope that we use this time to  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:24:55):**  we have an incredible advancement in technology, things like satellites that are able to measure  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:00):**  groundwater around the world. There's so many different ways in which we can anticipate  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:05):**  these risks and we can get people out of harm's way now. And I hope that we take the opportunity  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:10):**  to do this because if we don't, it could bring out the worst in people and I hope we avoid  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:15):**  that future. Yeah. I think that, you know, here's the, this is the important thing too  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:21):**  is not to just focus on the doom and gloom and to really understand that the technological  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:26):**  innovations that we have and the capabilities, the analytical capacity, we need to think  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:32):**  about all the opportunities and ways in which we can build a more resilient world, a world  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:36):**  of the future. Climate, food and national security is a critically  
**[0:25:41-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:41):**  important issue. And right now a lot more needs to be done to realistically analyse  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:45):**  the threats and then to develop, fund and deliver practice and policies that mitigate  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:50):**  the risks and help to build stronger, safer and more resilient societies. Over the next  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Climate--food--national-security-eb5fgq#t=0:25:56):**  few months, we'll return to this issue and consider key aspects in more detail. But for

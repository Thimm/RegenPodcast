### Farm Gate  (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 12:01:03)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. Today we travel to Christchurch,  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:10):**  New Zealand to speak with Glen Herrod, the founder of the Happy Cow Milk Company.  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:15):**  Glen founded Happy Cow, a cow and calf dairy business, in 2014. But despite the fact that  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:21):**  the farming end of the operation was working well, he had trouble with distribution. The  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:25):**  company ran out of cash within a few years, but what happened next was truly remarkable.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:31):**  His story went viral and ordinary people from all over the world chipped in a few dollars  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:36):**  a month to help keep his business afloat. And now following a fundamental and revolutionary  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:41):**  redesign of his distribution system, Happy Cow 2.0 is ready to launch. At the heart of  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:47):**  the Happy Cow milk co is an ambition to help farmers sell direct to citizens. Dairy farming  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:53):**  is part of Glen's family heritage, but a decade ago he took a step back, looked at  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:00:58):**  the industry and decided that there was a need and an opportunity to do something different.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:04):**  I started by asking Glen Herrod why he felt it was important to try something new.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:09):**  I suppose the New Zealand dairy industry is quite different to the rest of the world in  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:13):**  that we've had our shear farming system where the landowner would own the farm and  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:18):**  a shear milker would own the cows. So the shear milker would come in and do all the  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:23):**  work and milk the cows using the infrastructure that's owned by the landowner and they would  
**[0:01:27-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:27):**  split the money 50-50. So it used to be a very good system for a shear milker because  
**[0:01:33-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:33):**  they would make quite a high return on capital. So they were able to make a good return, save  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:40):**  the money and then buy a farm. And it was good for farm owners because they got sick  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:45):**  of milking cows and they would get someone else to do it. But the shear farming system  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:49):**  is very different now and it's not eliminated, but it's not what it used to be. It's  
**[0:01:56-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:01:56):**  part of the dairy farming culture. You start, you know, you leave school or whatever, you  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:00):**  buy some cows and then you do that for five years and then you go shear milking, do that  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:04):**  for five years or so and then you buy a farm. And that's kind of what's happened since  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:10):**  the 60s really. And just I think the trend that we're seeing in every industry is we're  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:16):**  getting larger and larger. Scale is getting bigger and bigger. So now if we looked in  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:21):**  the early 80s, an average farm in New Zealand was 150 odd cows and now the average herd  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:26):**  is 450, maybe 500 cows in New Zealand now. Originally the idea was that that barrier  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:32):**  of entry is getting higher and higher. You know, instead of needing 150 cows to be a  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:37):**  farmer, you now needed 500 or whatever the number may be. So that was the original thinking  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:42):**  and I sort of thought, well, how can we simplify what constitutes dairy farm? You know, a dairy  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:48):**  farm is a milking parlour, lots of concrete, effluent systems, fences, laneways, all those  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:53):**  sorts of things. And I just felt that if we could simplify it and maybe do a mobile cow  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:02:58):**  shed, we could build a milking platform without needing a lot of the infrastructure. And I  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:03):**  think there's a few farmers around the world who have been doing that. It's quite common.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:07):**  Well, they used to do it back in the day, back in Holland and Belgium and the like,  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:11):**  and it was really sort of just feeding off that. And it was the motivation was how to  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:17):**  reduce the barrier of entry to farming so that the next generation can come through.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:21):**  So we're moving from a system in your vision from that share milking, from anybody needing  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:27):**  to own and manage significant infrastructure that usually goes along with a dairy farm  
**[0:03:34-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:34):**  and going back to or introducing a mobile system that moves around a field and the cows  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:41):**  come to the system.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:42):**  Yeah. And I really did that just because I didn't have the capital. But yeah, so we built  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:46):**  this mobile cow shed. And I'm also aware that farmers always have one customer and that  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:51):**  customer is the milk company that they supply. And whether they're a co-op or they sell to  
**[0:03:57-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:03:57):**  a corporate processor, having that one customer means you can't diversify and it means they're  
**[0:04:03-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:03):**  really price takers. And this is a problem that all primary producers tend to have around  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:07):**  the world. And in New Zealand, although we have co-ops, we export 90% or 97% of all our  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:13):**  milk produced and our farmers are not in touch with the consumer or the public. And what  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:19):**  we've seen in the last 20 years in particular is the New Zealand public sort of turning  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:23):**  against dairy farmers and they're just not on board with the way dairy has gone. We've  
**[0:04:27-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:27):**  had this massive dairy boom and the dairy industry is, well, it is the backbone of New  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:33):**  Zealand's economy. And it's what's going to save us in this recession or depression we're  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:37):**  going through now. But they've lost touch with the public. So part of what I'm trying  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:42):**  to do with Happy Cow is if we can get farmers to sell direct to the consumer rather than  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:47):**  their co-op doing it or private companies do it, we get that connection. And part of  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:52):**  the whole story of Happy Cow is really how consumers have had a direct contact with me  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:58):**  and my story.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:04:59):**  Mason It's interesting. So we've talked a little  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:01):**  bit about the economic drivers behind what you wanted to do and some of the social drivers.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:08):**  There are also welfare and environmental drivers behind the decisions that you were making.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:13):**  And part of that is around wanting to have a cow and calf operation.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:17):**  David So what happened was I wanted to build this  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:20):**  mobile cow shed and then we built a milk processing room on the front of it. So it was a big long  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:26):**  trailer about 10 metres long. So cows at the back had five sets of cups at the back or  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:31):**  six I think. And then we had the pasteuriser in the front and I would milk and pasteurise  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:35):**  the milk directly in the paddock. And then the idea was to put that milk into a tank  
**[0:05:40-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:40):**  and take it to a vending machine. So when I started, I had to test all this out. So  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:44):**  I bought six cows and I leased some land and started the process of figuring out how to  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:50):**  do all this. And obviously these cows were calving and I needed to do something with  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:55):**  the calves. And because it was leased land, I didn't have calf sheds, I didn't have calf  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:05:59):**  feeding equipment, and I really didn't have any time to deal with calves. So I thought  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:04):**  I'll just leave them with their mothers as a temporary measure to, well not a temporary  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:08):**  measure, it was we'll leave them with their mothers and that's one less thing that I need  
**[0:06:11-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:11):**  to worry about.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:12):**  So it was more more expediency than a particular desire to improve that welfare situation at  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:20):**  the time.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:21):**  I hadn't really thought enough about it because I was still thinking about milk processing  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:25):**  regulations, engineering stuff, trying to get milk to market, all those sorts of things.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:30):**  The farming, because I've been farming my whole life, I wasn't worried about the farming  
**[0:06:33-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:33):**  stuff because I knew how to do all that. I was concentrating on the stuff I didn't know  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:36):**  how to do. And we originally went in thinking that our proposition to the public was a much  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:43):**  more sustainable environmental offering really. And I didn't really realise that people had  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:49):**  an issue with animal welfare of cows. I was a little naive at this stage. And then when  
**[0:06:53-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:53):**  I started selling milk, I would tell, they would ask what happened to the calves. Everyone  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:06:56):**  was asking me about it and now it's really what we've become known for. And obviously  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:01):**  it's sort of happening around the world now.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:04):**  And that must, you know, if you have a calf staying with a cow, then obviously they're  
**[0:07:08-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:08):**  sharing that milk. And what kind of impact does it have on the economics of what you're  
**[0:07:12-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:12):**  doing?  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:13):**  Yeah, so it's interesting. So because I was milking the cows in the middle of the paddock,  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:17):**  I'm bringing the milking parlour to the cows. The cows just sit in the paddock with their  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:21):**  calves and we milk them and then they walk off the trailer and go back to their calves.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:25):**  And it's quite a simple process. And because we're doing 365 day supply, we want our cows  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:31):**  to be sort of calving all year round. And that's quite uncommon for New Zealand because  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:35):**  we have a seasonal supply. We basically want all our cows to calve in the four week period  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:39):**  of August, August and September. So when you think about what the workload of removing  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:47):**  a calf from its mother and then milking the cow, putting the calf into a shed, taking  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:52):**  the milk, putting it into a tank, hooking the tank to your tractor, driving the tank  
**[0:07:56-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:07:56):**  to the calf, employing someone to feed that calf and then taking the truck to the tank  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:00):**  back and things. There's a whole lot of workload involved with that and labour is involved  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:04):**  with it. So if you leave your calves with your mothers, the workload involved is you  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:09):**  put a tag in its ear when it's born and then you weigh it every four weeks or something.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:15):**  And so yes, that calf will drink more milk.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:18):**  But the input costs go down significantly.  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:20):**  Yeah. So I'm all about simplifying the system and reducing your dependency on labour and  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:25):**  also just reducing the amount of work you have to do during the day. We're not doing  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:29):**  this currently. I don't have cows currently, but the model we're trying to push forward  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:33):**  is that you would get a calf to about eight weeks of age and at that point we'd want to  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:37):**  put some type of flap in their nose that makes it difficult for them to drink milk and leave  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:43):**  them with the mother for a couple of more weeks. And then you would separate them, put  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:48):**  them into the paddock next door, into a calf roof paddock and the calf and the mother will  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:54):**  sort of meet each other across the fence. And I think the research that I've read is  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:08:57):**  they'll do that for a couple of days and then they just naturally go their separate ways.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:01):**  I had a bit of everything. I had areas, I had frisions, I had jerseys and then we had  
**[0:09:05-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:05):**  everything crossed in between.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:07):**  And do you have a sense of how many litres you would be getting annually from an individual  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:14):**  cow?  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:15):**  So we were milking once a day to start off with. So that was a little reduced a bit.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:21):**  Our cows were doing around 20 litres a day. Cows in New Zealand generally produce less  
**[0:09:25-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:25):**  than the rest of the world because we go on our pasture based system.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:29):**  How does that compare with cows in the more traditional New Zealand systems?  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:34):**  Cows are about the same. Let me clarify that. When we were doing once a day with the calf  
**[0:09:38-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:38):**  on its mother, we were doing around that 17 to 18 litres per day. But when we started  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:44):**  going onto a twice a day system and it gets a little confusing because we had frisions  
**[0:09:48-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:48):**  which produce more milk, we're sort of around that 20 litres. But I think the New Zealand  
**[0:09:52-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:52):**  average is around 20 litres as well.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:54):**  We were paid on milk solids by the factory. So jerseys are quite good. Well, the Kiwi  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:09:59):**  Cross, the Jersey Frisian Cross is what New Zealand dairy farmers are quite fond of because  
**[0:10:04-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:04):**  they, although they don't produce the most milk, they're actually the most efficient  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:07):**  harvester of milk, of grass. So they turn grass into milk and being paid in the milk  
**[0:10:13-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:13):**  solid basis, that works really well.  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:15):**  It's interesting that, you know, in that system where you've reduced your input costs, you're  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:20):**  giving much more freedom for the cattle generally. Calves staying with them for a couple of months  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:25):**  and then that assisted weaning. And in terms of New Zealand, you're getting a very similar  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:30):**  litreage per cow to the rest of the industry. And it's a remarkably different system that  
**[0:10:36-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:36):**  you're running.  
**[0:10:37-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:37):**  We're getting a lot of resistance from farmers because they can see the public taking to  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:42):**  it. You get quite a bit because, I mean, we call ourselves the Happy Cow Milk Company.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:46):**  So if you, we put a bit of mark in and out and we say, look at our happy cows, we leave  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:50):**  the cows with their mothers. Existing dairy farmers, they get a bit upset because they're  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:54):**  essentially saying that their cows aren't happy because they take their cows with their  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:10:59):**  mothers.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:00):**  Yeah.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:01):**  So we have all those sorts of debates and it's a lot of defensive stuff going on. But  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:04):**  my focus is how do we make the smaller, these smaller family farms around the world, how  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:08):**  do we make them have a competitive advantage against the big boys who are smothering them?  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:12):**  The story that you tell, I recognise from elsewhere around the world, particularly in  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:17):**  places where it's a relatively new idea to have an independent farm or an independent  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:24):**  business which is selling and branding directly to the public because sort of automatically  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:29):**  you start to get those issues sort of rising up between, you know, where you've got a situation  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:34):**  where the majority of dairy producers are working towards a particular customer or a  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:41):**  particular export model and then somebody comes along and rocks the boat and says, look  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:46):**  at me, I'm different. So in New Zealand, is it relatively unusual for there to be a smaller  
**[0:11:51-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:51):**  family business selling directly to the public?  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:54):**  It is relatively unusual. There's probably only maybe 10 in New Zealand who are doing  
**[0:11:58-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:58):**  it. There's a lot of them.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:11:59):**  Gosh, that is small. Yeah.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:00):**  You'll have them in the UK, you know, the farmer with the vending machine at the end  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:04):**  of the gate.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:05):**  There are lots now. And over the last decade we've seen a, you know, a really substantial  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:09):**  increase and I think we're hoping over the next decade that we will see an enormous shift  
**[0:12:14-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:14):**  in independent farmers, farmers working cooperatively at a landscape scale or as an individual scale  
**[0:12:21-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:21):**  to reconnect with the public and reestablish that connection which has been lost, you know,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:29):**  through dairy farmers or other farmers simply supplying into a retailer model or or supplying  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:36):**  into a big corporate model because at that point, that relationship between the customer  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:41):**  and the farmer that used to exist up until relatively recently has been lost.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:47):**  Yeah. And I mean, there's lots of the farmers are doing that for a reason because it's no  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:52):**  joke processing your own milk and distributing it and creating a brand. It's hard. And, you  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:12:57):**  know, the number of farmers who have contacted me over the years and said, oh, we did it  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:01):**  for five years and basically five years tends to be the cutoff. You do it for five years  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:05):**  and then they find out it's just too much too hard.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:08):**  Things went wrong. The business didn't work, but you're still there. So what went wrong  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:13):**  and why are you still there trying?  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:16):**  Well, yeah, I mean, it did go wrong. What really happened was we were growing so fast  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:21):**  that we couldn't keep up and we ran out of capital. We could see what needed to be done.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:25):**  We had lots of customers who were wanting our milk. We were trying to do it. And, you  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:29):**  know, I probably started off undercapitalised and I utilised everything I could and we wasn't  
**[0:13:35-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:35):**  able to really sell the vision to the bank without them taking, well, I ran out of equity  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:42):**  basically to offer up the security.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:44):**  And you said you started with six cows. So you say, you know, you were growing and couldn't  
**[0:13:48-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:48):**  keep up. And so where were you at that stage? How many cows did you have at that stage?  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:13:54):**  We got to 60 cows in milk. So we had 60 cows in milk and then a lot of dry cows as well.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:00):**  So we'd grown quite quickly over a three year period, basically. And the main issue was  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:07):**  how do we process milk efficiently and how do we distribute it efficiently? And that  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:12):**  was what really took my day. I took my time and trying to figure that out. And then, you  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:16):**  know, we become so labour intensive and generally the whole time there was work for, you know,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:22):**  work for two people, but there was only the money for one. And then you would upgrade  
**[0:14:25-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:25):**  the equipment and grow a little bit bigger. And then there was work for three people,  
**[0:14:29-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:29):**  but only money for two. And it was really a typical small business conundrum where you  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:36):**  just don't have that efficiency.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:38):**  So it was the costs of distribution in terms of labour and physically getting the milk  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:43):**  from the farm out to customers. How far were you travelling to get milk to customers?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:48):**  We've got a population of 350,000 in Christchurch. So I was driving 30 odd kilometres.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:53):**  So it was still just, it was one distribution point?  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:56):**  My driver would start at six in the morning, he'd be back at six at night and he would  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:14:59):**  have done 30 deliveries. So we priced our product at the premium end. So we were around  
**[0:15:04-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:04):**  $4.50 NZD a litre. So I don't know if you work with that as in pounds, but it was very  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:12):**  expensive. What happened was we would get lots of people, lots of retail outlets wanting  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:16):**  to sell our milk, but they'd only sell a small amount of milk. So therefore you'd do 30 deliveries  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:20):**  a day to service all these small retailers and cafes and so on. Where if we could just  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:27):**  go to a supermarket and do maybe three deliveries and sell the same volume of milk, that would  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:32):**  be much better. The problem we had was the reusable packaging. So the reusable, as well  
**[0:15:38-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:38):**  as the carbs and the environmental aspect, basically the reusable glass bottle was another  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:44):**  big thing that our customers love. And what we wanted to bring back, but that was also  
**[0:15:48-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:48):**  the very thing that stopped us from scaling. And it was really the supermarkets didn't  
**[0:15:52-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:52):**  want to deal with that because they're not set up to take bottles back. And some of them  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:15:57):**  did, and we did have good relationships with them. But again, they would also view us as  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:01):**  a niche product. So then they would actually charge or put a big margin on the product  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:06):**  and then it becomes even more expensive. And then you sell even less. And this would probably  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:11):**  work if you're in the UK because you've got such a big population. You see, we were getting  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:16):**  the hardcore customers who would crawl over broken glass to support us and, you know,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:21):**  do whatever it takes to bring their bottle in. But for the most part, most people aren't  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:26):**  that committed. And even if you could get them to pay a premium, they're not really  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:30):**  that into it. And then when you've got a small population base like we do, it's actually  
**[0:16:34-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:34):**  quite difficult to sell 1000 litres a day.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:37):**  So you ran out of money and decided at that point, I mean, how did you feel at that point?  
**[0:16:41-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:41):**  Because you put an awful lot of heart and soul into this.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:44):**  Well, yeah, basically, that last sort of six months is really a blur. Actually, I can't  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:50):**  really remember it even it was two years ago. But yeah, it was just a determination of not  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:16:56):**  failing because you couldn't, I couldn't afford to fail. I mean, I put everything into it.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:00):**  You know, I've been working on this since really, I've been working on this since 2008.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:04):**  And so the realisation that it wasn't working and trying to figure out how to do it and  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:09):**  bringing in people to help me and getting advisors and you find ways to grow essentially,  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:14):**  it was Yeah, it was um, it's a tough time. So when the decision was made to close it  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:19):**  down, I didn't really know what to do. I just sort of put the message out the Facebook that  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:24):**  we're going to shut down. And I chosen to close it in because I knew that we could sell  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:29):**  all our assets and, and pay off our creditors and then shutting it down. And we got a lot  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:34):**  of support from all our customers. In fact, my story, I was asked to write a story for  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:40):**  one of our newspapers. So I sort of explained how it went. And that story went global, like  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:44):**  literally went global. And it ended up on forums and Silicon Valley. And I had people  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:49):**  in Sweden and Denmark and  
**[0:17:51-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:51):**  Toby  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:51):**  What was it that made it go viral?  
**[0:17:53-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:53):**  David  
**[0:17:54-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:54):**  Just being honest and open and just, I suppose, not trying to, you know, make it sound like  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:17:58):**  I'm a big expert and just saying, look, I tried to do this, this is my vision. And this  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:03):**  is what I found really hard. This is actually, you know, you can't, maybe you can't do it  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:07):**  in small, you know, maybe there's all these hassles and all these difficulties. So, so  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:11):**  what people were seeing was here's this guy who's trying to change dairy with his animal  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:15):**  welfare, with the reusable packaging, all those sorts of things, and the systems basically  
**[0:18:21-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:21):**  knocked them down.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:22):**  So what happened next?  
**[0:18:23-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:23):**  David  
**[0:18:24-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:24):**  So I set up a Patreon account. Patreon allows members of the public to donate money. So  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:31):**  I just said to our fan base, I said, Well, you would like to see Happy Cow Milk carry  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:37):**  on, you know, I'm just I'm definitely going to carry on. I'm not giving up yet. But, you  
**[0:18:42-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:42):**  know, just give us a couple of dollars a month, and we'll see what happens. So we had around  
**[0:18:46-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:46):**  770 people at the peak, I think donating anywhere from $1 to even $100 a month.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:52):**  David  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:53):**  Mostly New Zealand citizens or?  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:54):**  David  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:55):**  Well, in the world.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:56):**  David  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:18:57):**  Gosh. That's remarkable, isn't it? Remarkable because you got people from the other  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:00):**  side of the world who are likely never to taste the milk that you're producing, still  
**[0:19:06-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:06):**  contributing.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:07):**  David  
**[0:19:08-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:08):**  Yeah, that's right. And so I think we got up to around around 7000 US dollars a month,  
**[0:19:14-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:14):**  seven, 8000, somewhere around there. And that enabled me to basically keep the lights on,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:21):**  and then restart again, basically start thinking, well, everything that I've learned, well,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:24):**  basically, I slept for a month, and then got back into it and just analysed everything  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:29):**  and just got the spreadsheets out. I got a few interns from a local university to help  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:33):**  me. And we just analysed distribution costs, we analysed and figure out where was the cost  
**[0:19:39-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:39):**  in the whole system, and how can we streamline it and make it better. Because essentially,  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:43):**  all we've done is we've done a traditional milk processing model, but we've done it at  
**[0:19:49-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:49):**  small scale. So we had no economies of scale. And if we look at the way other companies  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:53):**  in history have innovated and changed things, as they essentially, you know, they simplify  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:19:58):**  things, they make it simpler, they make it easier, and they drop the cost. And really,  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:03):**  it was clear to me that if you're going to sell milk, milk is like a staple, it's not,  
**[0:20:07-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:07):**  you know, we can tell all the stories you like about your cows, and we love our cows  
**[0:20:10-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:10):**  and everything. It's still milk to most people.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:12):**  Toby  
**[0:20:13-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:13):**  It's not a luxury product. It's something that people need on a daily basis, like bread.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:17):**  David  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:18):**  Yeah. And you look at the figures and vast majority of people will buy the budget milk  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:22):**  in New Zealand. The cheapest milk is 70% of the population buy the cheapest milk. And  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:27):**  we were playing in the very premium end. And that's really what a lot of farmers always  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:32):**  think is like, Oh, we can get a premium by doing this. Or how can we get a premium. And  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:36):**  when I looked at, you know, a lot of innovation, they don't actually try and get a premium,  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:40):**  they actually drop the cost. And it changed my whole mindset about how we're doing things.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:44):**  You know, if you look at McDonald's, they created a system that allowed any teenager  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:48):**  to make a burger, and they dropped the price of burgers dramatically to what was available.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:53):**  Toby  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:54):**  And I guess part of your challenge is the short shelf life.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:56):**  David Yeah, that's right. Yes, just thinking through  
**[0:20:59-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:20:59):**  this. And really what we realised is when you're in the milk processing side of things,  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:02):**  I mean, I left the farming side alone, because that wasn't really broken. The milk processing  
**[0:21:07-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:07):**  was. So what we figured out is that 80% of the cost of milk processing is really where  
**[0:21:13-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:13):**  is handling pasteurized milk. So it's when you take the milk out of the pasteurizer goes  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:17):**  through the cooler goes into a holding tank or the bottle machine or whatever, because  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:21):**  you can't contaminate that milk, it has to be in a process room and you wear your your  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:26):**  hair nets and your your special boots and all those sorts of things that creates a lot  
**[0:21:30-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:30):**  of cost. So I will double down on how do we fix that problem. And the second thing was  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:35):**  distribution, you know, delivering milk all around, doing lots of deliveries, lots of  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:40):**  small deliveries everywhere was just not going to work. It wasn't scalable.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:44):**  Toby So what's the new system that you came up with?  
**[0:21:47-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:47):**  David So essentially, we've developed a milk pasteurizer  
**[0:21:50-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:50):**  about the size of a dishwasher. Well, if you see a dishwasher and you chop it in half,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:21:56):**  it's about the size of half a dishwasher. So it's around 120 litre tank. And the principle  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:00):**  around that is that this tank is a pasteurizer when it's at the farm, it's a storage tank,  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:07):**  and it's also a milk dispenser all in one. So when this tank it's basically a tank with  
**[0:22:12-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:12):**  the microcontroller on the lid on the top, and this fits this will attach to a processing  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:18):**  hub at the milking parlour and it's controlled by an iPad. It's basically milk processing  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:23):**  by numbers. So the idea is, is when we look at innovation, it's how do you get something  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:28):**  that is an expert that you need experts to do and how do you make a lay person do it,  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:32):**  you know, like McDonald's. So how do we get someone to be a process engineer? Or how do  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:37):**  we get a farmer to be able to process milk without having to get all the training and  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:41):**  also without the risk of them contaminating the milk? So the first thing  
**[0:22:45-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:45):**  So you talk about on your website, you talk about dairy democratized. And is that what  
**[0:22:50-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:50):**  you mean that it's something that suddenly it's a system which is accessible and usable  
**[0:22:56-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:56):**  by by almost anybody?  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:22:57):**  Yeah, so I mean, I'm basically aiming that a 10 year old can operate this, you know,  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:02):**  anyone should be able to walk up to this hub with a tank and follow the prompts on the  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:06):**  iPad and they will be able to process milk in a way that there's no way that they can  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:11):**  contaminate it and it only works one way. And what it's really doing is sending all  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:15):**  this data up to the cloud and we're ticking off checkboxes and allowing it to be fully  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:20):**  audited and then when critical periods like the heating step, the actual pasteurization  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:26):**  of the milk, when that takes place, our system takes over and carefully monitors it and double  
**[0:23:31-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:31):**  checks it and all those sorts of things. And the human is only there to do the things that  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:34):**  a computer can't do. And that's like load the tank in and open a tap or disconnect pipe,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:40):**  those sorts of things. And the way we do that is that they fill this tank up with raw milk,  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:44):**  push the button, it pasteurizes, it cools down, and then they take that entire tank,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:48):**  put it on the back of their truck and they drive it into town. So that tank now becomes  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:53):**  the final packaging. So there's no risk, there's no workload of the farmer having to pump the  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:23:58):**  milk out, put it in bottle it and all those sorts of things. And there's no risk of them  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:02):**  contaminating the milk. So it's very low risk way of doing things. So from a farmer's perspective,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:07):**  you fill these tanks up, push a button, pasteurizes, and then they look at our app and we tell  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:12):**  them where to deliver it. They'll put it on their truck, drive it into town to wherever  
**[0:24:16-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:16):**  we've told them to deliver it to, pick up the empty tanks and replace the full ones.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:21):**  And then what happens is it's got a milk pump and a control system and payment system attached  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:27):**  to it as well. So customers can just buy straight from that tank or cafes can fill up straight  
**[0:24:32-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:32):**  from that tank. What we've actually done is anyone with this tank can now become a milk  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:38):**  retailer. So that means that anyone, it's a little business in a box basically. So someone  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:45):**  can decide they're at number one Williams Street and they're going to do home delivery  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:49):**  to all of Williams Street and maybe two streets down. So they can literally walk down the  
**[0:24:54-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:54):**  door to door with this tank and filling up people's bottles. And because we've got a  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:24:59):**  digital payment system, the payment all gets done automatically. So there's no change of  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:04):**  hands of money or anything like that. And it splits the transaction. So the retailer  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:10):**  will get 50 cents to a dollar and then the farmer gets a dollar 20 and then I get my  
**[0:25:15-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:15):**  cut.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:16):**  When you say it's a business in a box, it's something that you can use and that any other  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:21):**  farmers who want to employ a similar system, they can buy or lease one of these units from  
**[0:25:27-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:27):**  you.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:28):**  Well, no, it's more like Uber. Uber Eats, I suppose, where someone decides I'm going  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:32):**  to, how do I explain it? Like you can be an Uber driver. Instead of doing that, you can  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:36):**  be a Happy Cow milk seller. So you can decide I would like to sell milk and they just download  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:42):**  the app. Then they become a node, number one Williams Street. And basically what we're  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:46):**  saying to that person is you become the salesperson, you figure out how to sell the milk. You know,  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:51):**  there'll be a bit more structure about that. But rather than the farmer having to control  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:25:55):**  the brand, the farmer having to control the distribution and all the ordering and all  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:00):**  the invoicing and purchase ordering and things like that. We're saying the farmer, you produce  
**[0:26:04-0:26:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:04):**  milk in this tank and then we're going to find people who want to sell milk and get  
**[0:26:07-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:07):**  money. And we're really saying to those people, you just figure out how to sell it. So now  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:11):**  we've got this motivated sales team of people who have got their own little business and  
**[0:26:16-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:16):**  figuring out how to sell the most amount of milk they can. So they could be on the side  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:19):**  of the road, they could be at their house, it could be in their shop, it could be in  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:23):**  their cafe or it could be in a retail environment. There's all sorts of ways we'll do it. But  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:27):**  it changes the, we're sort of changing the way we think of it so that no one owns the  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:32):**  tanks. The tanks are sort of owned by us. No one really owns the system. They just plug  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:36):**  in and use the system and use the transaction. So we're really a platform that matches farmers  
**[0:26:43-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:43):**  to resellers and then matches consumers to resellers.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:46):**  It's fantastically scalable. The only block on this is the number of people that want  
**[0:26:53-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:53):**  to participate.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:54):**  Yeah. So if you're in Chichester for instance, and you're a farmer there and you decide you  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:26:59):**  want to do this, you probably get in touch with us. We would put you through a training  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:03):**  program online. The hub and the tanks would turn up one day after you pay us some money  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:08):**  and you plug that into the internet and that processing system now becomes fully compliant  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:13):**  with all UK food safety milk processing regulations. We would then while you're sitting up, figure  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:19):**  out who are going to be your resellers. Like we might say you need five cafes, you want  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:24):**  a couple of, I don't know, whatever home delivery people and that will get you a thousand litres  
**[0:27:29-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:29):**  a day that will sell your milk. That's enough milk for 50 cows or whatever. As soon as that  
**[0:27:34-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:34):**  farmer's ready to produce, we've got resellers ready to go and they're all into the system  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:38):**  and we're basically matching the farmer with those resellers to make sure that no one's  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:44):**  running out of milk basically. We're telling the farmer ahead of time how much milk's needed  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:48):**  and we're facilitating the transaction.  
**[0:27:52-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:27:52):**  So Happy Cow Milk Co phase one was changing the production system but still trying to  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:00):**  use a more old fashioned, a more traditional model of distribution. And what you've done  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:04):**  here is you say, well, we got the production element, the production element's okay, we're  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:08):**  going to change the distribution. And so you've got this, as you call it, democratised system  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:14):**  where anybody can choose to participate. I mean, which is really exciting and incredibly  
**[0:28:20-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:20):**  innovative. I wonder about quality control, how you can make sure that the product that's  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:28):**  going to the consumers is high quality, is the same quality for everybody that's receiving  
**[0:28:34-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:34):**  it.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:35):**  You know, we're sort of thinking someone would become the designated milk person for their  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:38):**  area and, you know, we'd want that to be a long term relationship and they build the  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:44):**  connection with the local customers and people can review them. It's like all online things.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:48):**  You get an Uber review, was my driver any good? So we'll have that sort of system going.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:53):**  For me, the far more important thing is that milk safety and the milk quality aspect that  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:28:58):**  you mentioned. So there's still all regulations require routine milk testing and the farmer  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:03):**  will have to do that. So there'll be, we'll facilitate that. So part of the system is  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:08):**  today is milk testing day, take this raw sample, take this many processed milk samples, put  
**[0:29:13-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:13):**  them in these containers and whatever and send them off to the lab. And then we're getting  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:18):**  those results at the same time as the farmer. So that's the manual side of things that I  
**[0:29:22-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:22):**  don't think we'll ever get around. And that's really important. The second thing is because  
**[0:29:26-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:26):**  this is a decentralised sort of system, when you think of milk processing and you think  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:30):**  of an existing milk factory, you know, you'd have a massive factory, big tanks doing massive  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:36):**  batches. The milk goes out the door and then it goes to however many thousands or hundreds  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:41):**  of retailers, which then go to all these customers and the factory has no idea who's actually  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:46):**  purchased that milk. So if there's a problem and they have to recall the milk, it's a national  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:51):**  catastrophe because you have to now, I will say how we do it in New Zealand, you have  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:29:55):**  to form the media, it all becomes on the front page, don't drink this milk, this batch number  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:00):**  is this, if you've got this, return it and all those sorts of things. That's because  
**[0:30:04-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:04):**  you've got the centralised system, one batch going to lots of places. We've got one little  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:08):**  farmer doing a little batch of milk, thousand litres a day, probably going to 1500 customers.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:13):**  If there's something wrong with that milk, we've got the email address, our system knows  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:18):**  exactly who's purchased that milk, we can immediately email them or text them and say  
**[0:30:21-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:21):**  don't drink that milk and sort of quarantine the issue. And that changes the kind of the  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:26):**  way you look at milk processing in that so much of the regulation you have in place,  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:32):**  that processes put in place is there as a, because the downside of having a bad batch  
**[0:30:38-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:38):**  go out is so enormously catastrophic that milk processing becomes so expensive. But  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:45):**  having said that, I don't want to make that sound like, oh, we can be a bit more blase  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:48):**  about processing milk.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:50):**  And the unit that you have developed, that's something that you've invented yourself, that  
**[0:30:57-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:30:57):**  you've adapted from other ideas, is that correct?  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:00):**  Yeah, so it's just funny how to get to this point, I borrowed my cousin's cheese bat,  
**[0:31:07-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:07):**  it was my first pasteuriser, a 200 litre cheese bat, and I worked out how that worked. And  
**[0:31:11-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:11):**  then I bought a tank off eBay and a 2000 litre tank, and that was my second pasteuriser.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:19):**  And we basically built that. And by doing that and getting it through the regulators,  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:24):**  I understood the processes of milk processing. And now I was able to, well, it's a new insight  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:29):**  and think about how we could do this and how we can build these pasteurisers differently.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:33):**  So yeah, we've built it, we've got custom electronics being developed at the moment  
**[0:31:37-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:37):**  and the COVID, like everyone, it's all affecting the way we can develop things. We've got a  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:45):**  little team of coders who are beavering away writing the code to make all this work. And  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:50):**  yeah, it's built from the ground up.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:52):**  And you were planning to launch at the start of April 2020. That's been delayed. When are  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:57):**  you planning to launch now?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:31:59):**  Well, we'll start up again in the first of June is the plan. And we'll just test out  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:03):**  what's what we've got. And we'll just figure out we'll start with home delivery, and just  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:08):**  test our assumptions and just make sure what we thought was going to work is going to work.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:13):**  And basically, we just need to make sure that the software and the hardware is just bulletproof  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:18):**  and just, you know, the payment system always works. The, you know, the pump always distributes  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:23):**  the right amount and those sorts of things. Once we've got all that sort of stuff, absolutely  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:27):**  solid, then we will raise some more capital and look to scale around the world.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:33):**  And maybe in a year's time, we can come back to you and just see how that that process  
**[0:32:37-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:37):**  has gone. Because what what strikes me, Glenn is that, you know, often on this podcast,  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:43):**  when we're talking about regenerative agriculture, or just in the last episode, we were talking  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:49):**  about a sheep lameness five point plan. And, and what strikes me in all of this is that  
**[0:32:55-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:32:55):**  it's, it's about how to take a holistic approach to to systems. That's what allows change.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:03):**  And so this was what you were finding that, that just looking at the production and relying  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:09):**  on an old fashioned distribution model didn't work. And so the way that you you're expecting  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:13):**  to make it work is by innovating that front end that distribution system as well. And  
**[0:33:20-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:20):**  it sounds like you know, you potentially you've, you've got a system where the productions  
**[0:33:27-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:27):**  going to work in the way that it was working before, you've got a new system which has  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:31):**  been demonstrated, you know, through Uber and through other decentralized economic models.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:38):**  And if that can work for milk as well, and and it sounds like there's no reason why it  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:42):**  shouldn't, you know, given a fair wind, that could be really exciting, really disrupting.  
**[0:33:49-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:49):**  And you know, and potentially a really big change, not just for you in Christchurch,  
**[0:33:54-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:54):**  or New Zealand, but potentially around the world.  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:33:57):**  Oh, absolutely. And while there's a lot of technology and everything to make that happen,  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:01):**  essentially, the whole goal right from the start was how do we get that farm local farmer  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:06):**  to supply their local market. And it's taken me eight years to get here, I didn't think  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:10):**  it was gonna be this difficult. But if you think of, I think you kind of actually have  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:13):**  to build the whole system from the ground up, you can't just do one little bit. And  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:17):**  I think of IKEA a lot of the way they do it, they've sort of said, you know, you can have  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:21):**  really cheap furniture that looks really good, but you have to put it together yourself.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:26):**  And we're kind of saying that, well, you can do that we can have happy cows to the environment,  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:30):**  but you have to bottle it yourself, basically. But so there's one thing but in order for  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:34):**  IKEA to actually deliver that they have to they make their own shipboard, they design  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:39):**  their own products, they ship their own products, they retail their own products, the whole  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:43):**  retail system is dictated to the customer, the only way they can go and all these things  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:48):**  especially designed so that they can get to that final product. So what we've kind of  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:53):**  had to do is go through that process. But the vision is, is that we don't put production  
**[0:34:58-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:34:58):**  parameters in place. I mean, we will have basic ones in place. But because everyone  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:02):**  in the world is so different, what we really want is those local customers to be directly  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:06):**  in contact with their farmers. So if you're in Chichester, for instance, and you've got  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:10):**  your bottle of milk, and you see arts from Frank and Karen, they can directly talk to  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:14):**  them. And then if they've got questions, they ask in the farmer directly. So then when they  
**[0:35:19-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:19):**  give me feedback, like the cow and calf thing that I was getting, it made me makes me take  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:23):**  notice because I'm getting all these emails or Facebook messages from people telling me  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:27):**  this so it's it's alert, it's registering in my brain. So we want kind of use the public  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:32):**  as the the brand enforces or the people are going to drive the standards that we do on  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:38):**  the farm. Works the other way because the public can be completely unreasonable and  
**[0:35:43-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:43):**  not understand and ignorant. So what it does is actually creates a dialogue. And when someone  
**[0:35:49-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:49):**  knows the farmer, and they sort of feel like they're friends with them, the farmer can  
**[0:35:54-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:54):**  say, well, actually, you know, we're having a hard time because of this or we want issue  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:35:58):**  want to re-report in what's happening on the farm. So is the farm actually making money?  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:02):**  You know, they've had a drought, they've got no, they've got no grass, you know, now the  
**[0:36:07-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:07):**  cost of production has gone up, we sort of want, it's a fine line, we don't quite know where  
**[0:36:10-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:10):**  it is. But this principle of the customer, if they're interested, they're able to know  
**[0:36:15-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:15):**  who the farmer is a little bit better. And when they have this sort of friendship model,  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:21):**  they're less likely to be so black and white in their expectations.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:26):**  That was Glenn Herrod, preparing to launch Happy Cow Milk Code 2.0 and describing his  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:32):**  innovative and disruptive approach not only to dairy production, but to milk distribution  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Happy-Cow-Milk-Co--New-Zealand-edbp54#t=0:36:37):**  as well. If you've enjoyed listening, please come back and listen to more. Tell your friends,

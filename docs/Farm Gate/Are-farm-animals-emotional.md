### Farm Gate  (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 08:42:36)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Fenlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell. Do farm animals  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:10):**  experience emotions? Or are the behaviours people perceive as emotions purely an instinctive  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:16):**  response? Animal welfare science is well advanced, based on the principle that all animals experience  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:21):**  pleasure and pain, and that all animals should have the opportunity to express natural behaviours.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:27):**  But are farm animals really emotional? For example, do cows feel happy or depressed?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:33):**  And does it really matter? Should a farm animal's ability to react instinctively or respond  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:37):**  emotionally affect the way that we care for and handle livestock?  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:41):**  I'm joined by two experts in the field. Professor David Main is a veterinary surgeon and professor  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:46):**  of production of animal health and welfare at the Royal Agricultural University. Rachel  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:50):**  Hauler is a cattle farmer for Mondross Farm in Somerset, who helped as part of the RAU's  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:55):**  farmer working group on a project to develop a positive welfare framework. Welcome both.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:00):**  Hello. Hi.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:01):**  David, from an academic or physiological perspective, what's the difference between instinct and  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:07):**  emotion? Instincts are things, behaviours that animals  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:11):**  do that they don't need to learn about, that are the basis of their genes and their environment,  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:16):**  etc, that they just do and always do, and they don't have to have prior learning. Whereas  
**[0:01:22-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:22):**  emotion, of course, is about the feeling, the good or the bad emotional sense that an  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:29):**  animal has in response to an environment. So an animal will be showing an instinctive  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:34):**  behaviour, avoiding something, but that may or may not be associated with an emotional  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:40):**  sense. So is choice part of that? I mean, you've  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:42):**  specialised in farm animal welfare across your career. And so how do we know that farm  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:48):**  animals are experiencing emotions and that these behaviours that we're observing aren't  
**[0:01:52-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:52):**  simply just instinctive responses? Yeah, there's been quite a lot of effort  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:56):**  in the scientific literature to understand the emotional state of the animals. I mean,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:02):**  one can get all philosophical about this and start thinking, well, actually I'm not going  
**[0:02:06-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:06):**  to... Please do, you know.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:08):**  Even for people, we don't really know what's going on in other people's heads at any one  
**[0:02:12-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:12):**  time. But actually the physiological neuroanatomy behaviours that animals are showing match  
**[0:02:20-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:20):**  so closely onto our emotional responses that it's highly likely that they are emotional  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:28):**  responses. And of course, from an evolutionary point of view, the point of consciousness,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:33):**  did consciousness suddenly arrive with humans? No, consciousness is an evolutionary advantage  
**[0:02:41-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:41):**  that many other animals are experiencing. So yeah, the way that animals respond, they  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:47):**  respond predictably to positive and negative experiences, gives us a pretty good indication  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:53):**  that they are experiencing emotions. So if we take that sort of philosophical view  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:59):**  that you introduced there, then I don't know if you're feeling anything emotionally. I  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:04):**  can't know that for sure. But I know that I'm feeling something and that I'm reacting  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:08):**  to something and because your brain is wired similarly and because large animals, for example,  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:15):**  have similar wiring, from that perspective, we can take a pretty good bet that they experience  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:21):**  emotions. Yeah, that's good. Exactly that. And the point  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:24):**  is we can then predict. We can predict how humans are going to behave and we can predict  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:28):**  how animals are going to behave in similar circumstances. So it gives us a pretty good  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:32):**  idea that they are experiencing similarly bad things that they don't like and similarly  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:37):**  good things that they would choose to access, giving us an indication of what things that  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:43):**  they like as well as which things that they want to avoid and that are aversive.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:47):**  So when I framed that last question to you, it was around large animals because I think  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:52):**  if we see an animal that's a similar size to us, give or take, then it's easier to kind  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:57):**  of assume that they experience something in a relatively similar way. But is there a difference  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:01):**  between species? So for example, do chickens or do fish experience emotion in the same  
**[0:04:06-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:06):**  way that larger animals like cattle and sheep do?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:09):**  We don't know. We never will know exactly what it is to experience from their point  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:14):**  of view. And that is likely never going to be the case. But we know from an analogy that  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:20):**  they're likely to feel similar positive and negative emotions. Exactly how that is played  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:25):**  out is difficult to know. I think going back to philosophy, if you like, that Jeremy Bentham,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:31):**  famous philosopher, talked about animals, whether it's not a question of whether they  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:36):**  reason, it's a question of, or talk, it's a question of whether they suffer. And certainly  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:40):**  from a moral perspective, how we look after farm animals crucially is whether they can  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:46):**  suffer and what things we can provide. And as I'm sure we're going to talk about in a  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:50):**  minute, is what things that they like too also has a role to play in seeing how we should  
**[0:04:56-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:56):**  care for animals.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:57):**  So we talked there about the way the brain is and the ability to suffer, but I'm wondering  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:01):**  if there are sort of experiments that you're aware of with, you know, chicken or fish or  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:06):**  larger animals that have helped to demonstrate that emotional response, that emotional side  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:11):**  of the behaviour.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:12):**  Yes. So a good example is what they, they're increased sensitivity in a pain state. So  
**[0:05:19-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:19):**  animals can be subjected to pain during husbandry procedures, et cetera. And these animals remember  
**[0:05:25-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:25):**  those circumstances and avoid those similar situations, showing that it's aversive as you  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:32):**  like. And they're also showed high sensitivity because the physiology of the pain system  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:38):**  is that you become hypersensitive. And so they show the similar hypersensitivity as  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:43):**  people do. There's one infamous experiment, maybe this is a diversion, but I can tell  
**[0:05:47-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:47):**  you anyway. And that's around the pain associated with circumcision in babies. In babies, it  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:55):**  was assumed that circumcision wasn't a painful operation, but they had some babies that we  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:01):**  circumcised with or without local anaesthetic and that they could see several months later  
**[0:06:06-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:06):**  when these babies were then given their routine vaccinations is that those babies that had  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:12):**  had circumcision without local anaesthetic, their pain reactions, their vocalisations  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:18):**  were much more extreme than if they hadn't had it. So indicating that it was a painful  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:24):**  event that they experienced, that local anaesthetic was a better thing to do. And it actually  
**[0:06:28-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:28):**  persists for quite a long time, for several months.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:30):**  Jason Vale-  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:44):**  Well, firstly I just would just like to sort of set the scene in terms of where I'm coming  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:49):**  from, as a farmer in this conversation. So we're farming about 78 hectares down in Somerset  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:56):**  on the coastal levels, which is adjacent to the Bristol Channel below sea level. Over  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:01):**  a third of the farm has got herbal multi-species glaze sown and we're finishing native side organic  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:07):**  cattle at about 22 to 24 months off of grass and forage. This has replaced what was a dairy system,  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:14):**  so we were dairy up until two years ago. Most of our stores are bought as weaned, but we seem to  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:20):**  have accrued a dozen suckler cows, which is interesting because I do remember having  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:25):**  conversations saying we weren't going to have suckler cows. We seem to have got a dozen here,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:29):**  which I think have filled the emotional hole left by our dairy cows leaving, which is interesting.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:35):**  So that was your emotional hole?  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:37):**  I think so. I think we needed some cows to just have on the farm, just as a sort of backstop,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:44):**  so we'd go and have a scratch with them. So that was interesting in itself. Yeah, so examples of  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:49):**  why I think cattle are emotional creatures. Last weekend, actually, we went to visit some friends  
**[0:07:54-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:54):**  up in Shropshire who bought a couple of our dairy heifers two years ago. So these heifers have been  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:00):**  on the farm for about six to eight months with us and then they moved to Shropshire to these friends.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:05):**  So we walked into the field after lunch to go and see the cows. We went in with some other people  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:12):**  and one of these heifers actually strode up to me and literally sort of headbutted me and wanted  
**[0:08:18-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:18):**  a scratch. Of course, I reciprocated and I scratched the cow. And yes, I can't deny a little  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:25):**  tear in my eye to think that she recognised me. Then I thought perhaps I'm being silly and she  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:30):**  didn't recognise me. And I turned around to the other lady behind me and said, well, that was  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:34):**  weird, wasn't it? Do you think she recognised me? And she said, well, she didn't do it to me. And I  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:38):**  walked past her, you know, I can't prove that, can I? But it was very interesting. And yeah,  
**[0:08:43-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:43):**  it was nice to think that she recognised me and we did. Yeah, she had some scratches and she then  
**[0:08:50-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:50):**  went off to eat. So that, you know, maybe that's in emotion. There's also other examples I can  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:55):**  give. The time in February when the grass down here in Somerset just starts to grow,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:59):**  starts to green up. The cows seem to be able to smell it and they put their heads and noses over  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:05):**  the wall of the yards where they're housed over the winter. And this is the time of year that you  
**[0:09:10-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:10):**  got to be very careful not to leave a gate open by mistake or unlutched, because they will escape  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:15):**  out into the field. But when it is their time to go out, there is certainly some play behaviour.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:20):**  And I believe in Denmark and other countries, they actually do this as a day for the nation to come  
**[0:09:26-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:26):**  and watch the cows being turned out. Now you could argue, well, yeah, they're pleased to be out to  
**[0:09:32-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:32):**  eat the grass. But then why run round on it and play around on it? Why don't they just put their  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:36):**  heads down and eat? There's obviously something going on there that they are enjoying being out  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:40):**  in the field for the first time in the spring. And if you've got that sort of smell response  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:44):**  that you were talking about there, then that, you know, that's sort of creeping in for days or for  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:49):**  the weeks before they are let out. And that sort of sense of excitement must be building. And then,  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:54):**  you know, when you open the gate, the dam bursts. I think so. And I think we all experience it when  
**[0:09:59-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:59):**  we say, oh, I think spring is starting to come because there's a little birdsong and there's  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:03):**  some of the soil smells a bit different. And there are triggers. We all feel it. So why wouldn't  
**[0:10:09-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:09):**  a cow feel it? They also show curiosity and fear. And sometimes they can do those two together. So  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:16):**  if you go into a field, a new person goes into the field of cattle and just stands there,  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:21):**  the cattle will come up quite curiously and they sort of timidly come up to you. And then  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:27):**  if you just stand still, they'll come up and start licking you or get close. But if you perhaps move  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:32):**  your hand or brush your hair away or take your coat off, they jump back and then they start creeping  
**[0:10:37-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:37):**  up again. So that's, I think that's an emotion. That's a curious fear. So there are lots of  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:43):**  examples when I think it's just spending the time to stop and think about them. And then you realise  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:48):**  there are quite a lot of examples of that. And there's a degree to which if it was  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:51):**  instinctive behaviour, then they'd all do basically the same thing, kind of at the same time when  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:56):**  they're reacting to something. And, you know, I know when I walk through a field of cows,  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:00):**  that you've got cows that are more confident or a little bit stroppier, a little bit more friendly,  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:05):**  a little bit more curious. And there is that sort of that emotional diversity within a herd.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:10):**  Joanna  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:10):**  There is. And I think there's probably something more that David did comment on,  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:14):**  the different, I was trying to think about it myself. How do we differ  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:18):**  characters and characteristics and personalities? But there are, they do have different likes and  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:25):**  dislikes. And there are some that are bolder than others. That makes part of the job that we do  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:29):**  more interesting. It wouldn't be dull if they were all the same.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:32):**  David Now, you've spent 25 years, as you said, as a dairy farmer, and dairy farms now are getting  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:38):**  bigger and bigger, as increasingly they get consolidated. Do you think that farmers are  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:43):**  less able to give cows a good life and respond to their emotional needs on these large farms of 500  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:49):**  or 800 cows? Joanna  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:50):**  I don't think it's a case of large herds versus small herds argument. I don't think that's  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:56):**  relevant. I think what's important is how that farm is managed and how that unit is managed,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:02):**  particularly based on what resources they've got. So labour availability and the time available to  
**[0:12:08-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:08):**  spend with cows and with the cattle on that farm is probably the limiting factor. So having time  
**[0:12:16-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:16):**  out in the day and the routines of actually being with the cows and not having to do a job, so  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:21):**  having time to look over the gate and actually look and see what's happening with the cows rather  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:27):**  than head down on the tractor scraping, doing some milking, doing time out of the job in terms of  
**[0:12:34-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:34):**  actually looking at the cows and having a sufficient number of people. So it's an ongoing  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:39):**  challenge at the moment. And it's a very difficult one. Stockkeepers need to be consistent. So having  
**[0:12:44-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:44):**  the right people trained up to follow the same protocols is equally important. But also it can  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:51):**  be, you know, there is a sort of converse argument in actually a very small herd of cows managed by  
**[0:12:57-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:57):**  one person, 365 days a year. Those cows actually might have problems with strangers coming onto the  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:04):**  farm or say a vet comes on the farm because they actually have had less socialisation. So they  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:11):**  haven't been used to lots of new people. And they'll find that stranger interaction more  
**[0:13:16-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:16):**  stressful. So I don't think it's a large versus small argument. And I guess if there's just in  
**[0:13:22-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:22):**  that scenario where you've just got one farmer, then, you know, if they're coming up against  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:26):**  things that they don't understand or they haven't encountered before, then their knowledge base is  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:30):**  smaller, I suppose, than if you've got several stock people there. So I think that what you're  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:34):**  saying is it doesn't really matter if it's a really big farm or a relatively small farm. It's  
**[0:13:39-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:39):**  about the stock person ratio, stock person cow ratio, and making sure that there's some consistency,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:46):**  that the people who are looking after the cows are genuinely tending to their needs, which is  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:50):**  really interesting. So if we take that size issue, I guess there's a system issue as well.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:55):**  And so the question is really around sort of fully indoor permanently housed cattle and seasonally  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:01):**  grazed cattle. And this issue comes up a lot in dairy, particularly now where there is an ever  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:06):**  greater intensification and sort of more indoor herds in Britain, is whether or not cows need  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:12):**  grass. And bearing in mind those emotional needs that we've been discussing, what do you think?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:17):**  I think it's a simple question, but quite a complicated answer. I don't think it's about  
**[0:14:22-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:22):**  do cows need grass, more that it's about enriched environments. So I don't think it's a out at grass  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:30):**  versus housed argument per se. You could argue that cows that go out in a field with no diversity  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:36):**  in the sward, so they've only got grass, just one variety of grass to eat. If they got no shelter  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:41):**  from inclement weather, they've got no enriched things to play with or, you know, good tracks,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:48):**  that would probably be no better than a really good enriched environment indoors, which has got  
**[0:14:54-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:54):**  say different things to walk on, straw yards, loafing areas outside. You see a lot of brushes  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:01):**  now on dairy units, toys, scratching posts. The last winter we put in large tree stumps in our  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:08):**  housed area for them to play with and actually we moved those around as well so it became novel  
**[0:15:14-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:14):**  experiences. So I think the answer should be the environment should match what resources there are.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:20):**  So it would be wrong to out winter cows at grass all year round in Derbyshire on heavy soils,  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:27):**  because that would be not fair on the cows in terms of the conditions and the protection from  
**[0:15:32-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:32):**  the elements. So I think it's sort of bespoke. I think it should be resources match what's there  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:39):**  and make that indoor environment as close to a natural environment as you possibly can.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:45):**  So it's starting from the cows, starting from the land resource that you have and the human resource  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:51):**  that you have and designing your farm system, a bespoke farm system around that.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:56):**  Yes, yes, it's not, I don't think it's a one size fits all answer.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:00):**  Have you noticed a shift in the expectations of your customers as people have become more aware  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:05):**  of farm animal welfare as an issue and, you know, I've come to understand it better over  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:10):**  the course of the last 30 years or so? Yeah, so there has been a shift,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:14):**  there's no getting away from that. But I also think that now farms, we are audited,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:21):**  we actually have three audits a year. So our organic audit, our retractor audit,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:26):**  and other welfare schemes. So I think it's almost like they don't, they're probably worrying overly  
**[0:16:31-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:31):**  now when actually probably the worries should have been three decades ago. So I think we've come on  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:37):**  leaps and bounds. So I think but I actually, you know, as I said before, we actually enjoy  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:42):**  speaking to our, and we haven't got direct customers, but we actually enjoy interacting  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:47):**  with ultimately, everyone who eats, eats up, you know, meat or dairy or milk. They are customers,  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:53):**  aren't they? So yes, I think they're right to put an emphasis on that. And I don't think we've got  
**[0:16:59-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:59):**  anything to fear in terms of keeping up. And I think we're doing a lot more, we just need to  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:04):**  shout about it more. And as a farmer yourself, how do you think an understanding of animals  
**[0:17:10-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:10):**  as sentient, emotional creatures should change the way that we rear and treat livestock? Does  
**[0:17:16-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:16):**  it influence the way that you farm? There's a lot of things. Yeah, I've sort of  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:21):**  three things straight away about what we do with this in mind. So for example, if we're talking  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:27):**  about social needs of cattle, we tend to rear our, so if we're calf rearing, we always rear our  
**[0:17:34-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:34):**  calves in even numbers. So I think it's a known fact that having observed calves in research  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:41):**  experiments that they actually buddy up with a mate quite early on in life. And so if we're  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:47):**  keeping them in twos or fours or eights or sixteens, they're always with a friend, so to  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:52):**  speak. So that's something that we do. And also we try and rear in that social group, we try and  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:58):**  avoid mixing too much or too regularly as well. So try and once they go into that group, they stay  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:05):**  in that group. So it's a little bit like, we wouldn't expect children all going back to school  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:10):**  now, we wouldn't expect our children to move class every term and mix all the classes up, would we?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:15):**  They actually stay in that cohort group right the way through school. And there's a reason for that  
**[0:18:20-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:20):**  is because they make friends. And I don't think that's any different with cattle. We used to,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:26):**  when we had the dairy cows, a milk recorder, so someone would come onto the farm once a month,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:31):**  and record the milk yield per cow that each cow gives. And to do that, she has to write down the  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:37):**  numbers of the cows. So when the cow calves for the first time, she's given a unique number.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:43):**  And if they carve, obviously, when the same, roughly the same age, they'll have consecutive  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:48):**  numbers. One of our milk recorders used to play something called cow bingo. So when those cows  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:53):**  came into the parlour, if she had a like three consecutive numbers, like two, three and four,  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:58):**  stand next to each other in the parlour, that would be cow bingo, the ultimate would be say  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:03):**  four in a row. And actually, it was surprising how often that would happen. And why are we  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:08):**  surprised because yeah, they would come in with their mates, and they obviously worked out what  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:12):**  order they would would come in. And they could also tell which cows come in first, quite often  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:18):**  the same cows would come in the first part of the milking and then the same ones at the end.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:22):**  And actually, it's little things like that, that a farmer will notice. And when can number 15 is  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:28):**  last come in the parlour, where it usually comes in in the first half an hour, that would raise  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:32):**  alarm bells and they then they'd act on that, that information. So there's obviously something  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:37):**  perhaps not quite right with that cow. So it's it's almost a subconscious thing from the farmer  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:42):**  point of view. And the other things we do is just if we've got new experiences, so training cows to  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:48):**  the coming into the milking parlour, we allow time for them to learn and adapt to do that we don't  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:54):**  expect them to do a new thing straight away. And there's the same thing could be applied to people  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:59):**  couldn't it and making their environments interesting. I think recent lockdowns have  
**[0:20:04-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:04):**  probably highlighted the need that people need more than just food, water and shelter.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:09):**  They need interaction, they need exercise, and they need opportunities for play.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:13):**  David, there must be some kind of a link between positive welfare and productivity. Are you aware  
**[0:20:18-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:18):**  of any examples of that? Certainly, I think that there are lots of examples of industries making  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:24):**  very financially motivated decisions based on things that animals want and choose to do. And  
**[0:20:30-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:30):**  for example, Temple Grand in America has done some great work in abattoirs, which is really focusing  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:36):**  on the behavioural choice of what cows would choose to do in an abattoir and showing that  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:40):**  that actually leads to better outcomes for increased meat quality, etc. And there's a  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:46):**  really nice example of chickens. I mean, chickens production, the mantra for producing meat chickens  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:52):**  is that you have a one shared, you have a very uniform production system, same light patterns,  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:57):**  same food, because these are very similar chickens, they all need the same thing.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:02):**  And they don't need behavioural choice. But actually some interesting work to show that  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:06):**  like their ancestors, the red jungle fowl, actually chickens do quite like and choose to have  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:13):**  different types of light, different light patterns. So they in commercial chicken systems, they've  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:20):**  provided different amounts of light within a shed and actually it showed increased growth rate,  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:27):**  increase and improve food conversion ratio, just providing that diversity of light. And who would  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:33):**  have thought it that providing behavioural choice like that would actually increase  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:38):**  a commercial measure such as growth rate. So let's watch what the animals do and work with them.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:44):**  Thanks, David. I mentioned earlier, Rachel, that you helped as part of the Royal Agricultural  
**[0:21:49-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:49):**  University's Farmer Working Group on a new positive welfare framework. What sort of things  
**[0:21:54-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:54):**  were being measured in the pilot scheme that you were part of? So the audit, so as a dairy farmer,  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:00):**  we formed a little invited to form a focus group with other other farmers, and we actually  
**[0:22:05-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:05):**  brainstorm areas of a cow's life, so to speak, that will, we felt was contributed to a good life.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:11):**  So we tried to pick out areas that were key to contributing to a good life that formed a  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:16):**  framework. So those sections are physical environment. So that could be the flooring or  
**[0:22:22-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:22):**  the bedding. It could be the thermal environment. So how cold or hot or draughty somewhere was,  
**[0:22:29-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:29):**  it looked at play, social interactions, maternal cow-calf bonding, calves learning from their  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:38):**  mothers, interactions with stockkeepers, that was a really important one we felt had to be in there,  
**[0:22:44-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:44):**  access to pasture, feed choices, health and welfare, and observation and monitoring. So  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:51):**  we looked at how in tune, you know, farmers were with the cows in terms of their behaviour and  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:57):**  picking up problems before they arose almost. And the important thing about the framework  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:01):**  is that it could be applied to all types of systems. So it's a list of questions as to what  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:06):**  the cows have access to, but it can be those questions can be applied to all different sorts  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:10):**  of system. So my role really, for helping with this was to translate the science which David  
**[0:23:16-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:16):**  and his team had come up with, and translate that into a sort of farmer friendly language. So it  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:21):**  could be actually out those questions could be asked on farm without the need of a bit of  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:26):**  interpretation. Go on, give us an example of where the academics just got it wrong and they  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:31):**  needed to re-translate it into farmer speak. They didn't get it wrong, but there was probably things  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:36):**  like affiliative behaviour and licking or something. And I said, what does that actually  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:42):**  mean? And they said, well, it just means the cows are just grooming each other and playing. So,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:48):**  so yeah, so locomotor, we know we said that. I must use that phrase when my kids are playing  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:54):**  and mucking around later. I was telling them that's affiliative behaviour.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:59):**  Locomotor and things like that. It's like, do you mean running? Yes, we probably mean running.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:04):**  Okay, why don't we just put running then? So things like that. So it was a, yeah, it was a  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:09):**  really enjoyable piece of work to help with. So what stage David is RAU at now with the  
**[0:24:15-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:15):**  Positive Welfare Framework? And how is it going to be used?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:18):**  We don't know the answer to that is because it is being further developed and tested specifically  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:24):**  with DEFRA at the moment. They're exploring options for UK agricultural policy in the  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:29):**  animal health and welfare pathway, which involves financial incentives to farmers  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:34):**  to improve welfare. So the concept is being explored to understand farmers' attitudes to it,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:40):**  the financial costs of providing different things. And yeah, so that could inform that.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:45):**  So, so is the Positive Welfare Framework potentially going to be something that helps the  
**[0:24:50-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:50):**  farm payments for better welfare? Indeed, indeed. Exactly. That's, that's what  
**[0:24:53-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:53):**  it could be used for. I mean, at the end of the day, it is really also a communication tool  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:57):**  for farmers to share with others about what good stuff they're doing. And that can work at all  
**[0:25:02-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:02):**  sorts of levels, you know, farmers sharing ideas of best practice between other farmers.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:06):**  But also another potential use that sort of relates to that policy end is that different  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:12):**  countries want to describe that they're how well they are doing in animal welfare policy terms.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:19):**  You often hear about, you know, UK is world leading in animal welfare, and so say New Zealand,  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:24):**  and so say Denmark, and you know, you hear it in many, many places at the moment. That's primarily  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:29):**  based on legislation, which is a pretty rough measure of animal welfare performance. And so  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:35):**  positive welfare can help help with that. So that's something else that we're including in  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:39):**  the policy debates at the moment, because we, the national governments do want to share notes about  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:45):**  how well they're doing. And the positive welfare framework is potentially relevant at many different  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:50):**  levels from policy through to farmers. And fundamentally, it is about being able to  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:54):**  communicate how well farmers are caring for their animals. And within that framework, I mean, you  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:00):**  talk about being able to compare with other countries and have some sort of objective measure.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:04):**  Does that mean that they're scoring within the framework that farmers can do better or worse?  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:10):**  We're quite careful, actually, we've never gone down the route of really adding it up,  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:14):**  because actually, they're quite difficult. They're measuring very different things. And it's a quite  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:19):**  scientifically controversial to add them up and say one thing is more important than the other,  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:24):**  or twice as important as something else. So it's actually, we would prefer to think of it as more  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:29):**  of a discussion tool. This concept is important, and this concept is important, and there's  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:33):**  different ways of doing this and different ways of doing that, and share ideas. So really, the idea  
**[0:26:39-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:39):**  about positive welfare is to ensure that the good things in life are captured and valued, rather than  
**[0:26:46-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:46):**  turning on its head and having another way of nagging farmers. That's not the intention of the  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:51):**  exercise. Now, you've been involved in developing various farm animal welfare frameworks in the past.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:56):**  Do you think they're effective drivers of change? And actually, as a sort of subsidiary question,  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:01):**  who generally funds this kind of research? Where does the incentive come from to investigate these  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:06):**  sorts of things? Is the push coming from customers or from retailers or from government? Where's it  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:11):**  coming from? It's generally coming from all angles. I mean, let's take citizens, and I say that not  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:17):**  because you might say citizens, voting people that influence politicians, and they're quite clearly  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:23):**  animal welfare is on the agenda. So that's why we're talking about financial incentives.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:28):**  In the marketplace, it's either consumers seek out higher welfare, or even if they're not doing that,  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:34):**  they are choosing retailers that they trust, and retailers are making their purchasing decisions.  
**[0:27:40-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:40):**  And then, of course, as well as the retailers in the industry trying to deliver what they  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:47):**  expect their consumers to want, animal welfare charities, etc, have got an interest in promoting  
**[0:27:53-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:53):**  these ideas. So the funding has come from a range of those interested parties. It's not like the  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:00):**  old days, whereas animal welfare was a bad thing, and the industry was being defensive and trying to  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:06):**  stop all these bad stories. Genuinely, I see government, industry and civil society groups  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:12):**  genuinely having a debate about how best to improve welfare and communicate that to their  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:17):**  customers or citizens. Which seems to indicate to me that these frameworks that you've been  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:22):**  developing over the course of the last decade, or two or three, they are effective drivers of  
**[0:28:26-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:26):**  change, partly because they're able to communicate what it is that's expected and communicate the  
**[0:28:32-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:32):**  sort of change that's necessary. Exactly. Communication is critical, but sometimes,  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:36):**  actually, that activity doesn't, the communication happens at different levels. So, for example,  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:41):**  the work we've done on welfare outcome assessments, which is seeing how well, often, how healthy  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:46):**  animals are in laying hens and dairy, etc. That's obviously often a conversation between the  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:51):**  farmer assurance scheme and the farmer, and actually not so much between the customer. The  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:56):**  customer sees the logo on the packet and says, well, it's Red Tractor or RSPC assured or organic,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:01):**  whatever it is, and they have trust in that. So, that's the key communication vehicle to the  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:06):**  customer. But there is more detailed communication happening at the farmer end, which is about how  
**[0:29:12-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:12):**  many lent cows you've got, what the feather losses in your chickens are about. So, it's communication  
**[0:29:17-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:17):**  at different levels, and that communication needs to be relevant to that particular audience.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:22):**  Now, a different framework that you've been involved in in the past is a sure well,  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:25):**  and that was developing outcome-based assessments, which could then be sort of bolted on or integrated  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:31):**  within kind of Red Tractor assessments, for example, that sort of thing. Are you expecting  
**[0:29:35-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:35):**  the positive welfare framework to be used in a similar sort of way, or is it performing a  
**[0:29:40-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:40):**  different function? I think in due course, I think it could be, yes. The sure well welfare  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:44):**  outcome stuff is embedded into laying hen systems, dairy systems, pig systems, and those conversations  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:52):**  are already happening and data is being collected. And also improvements in welfare outcomes is being  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:57):**  demonstrated in all those sectors. On the positive welfare side, I think it's also often not about  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:03):**  farmer-to-farmer assessments, as we've been talking about. It is actually also very relevant  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:08):**  for looking at standards development, where different standards of different farm assurance  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:13):**  schemes need to move on to. So that's a different level of communication, and that is, it is already  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:19):**  being used for those discussions. Rachel, coming back to you and just sort of thinking for a moment  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:23):**  about broader sustainability, and part of my work has been about looking at the link between animal  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:29):**  health and welfare and the environment. And so from your own experience on the farm and from  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:34):**  your work with RAU, do you think that there is also a link between positive welfare experience,  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:40):**  good emotional experience, and good environmental outcomes? Yes, yeah, undoubtedly yes. If a dairy  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:46):**  animal has a longer and healthier life, she's going to require a lot less resources than  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:52):**  something that doesn't, the cow that doesn't. So there's less wasted inputs, and likewise for  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:57):**  a beef animal, it might grow faster from less feed, so its feed efficiency is more efficient  
**[0:31:03-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:03):**  if it's not set back. So for example, if we bought 20 beef animals from 20 different farms,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:11):**  I am certain that their productivity in terms of feed efficiency would be a lot worse than 20  
**[0:31:17-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:17):**  animals from one farm. So just by the fact that we're mixing those animals, not purely from a  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:22):**  disease point of view, but from a social point of view, they've all got their social groups and  
**[0:31:27-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:27):**  their social hierarchy. So the more we can make their life, give them more choice and enrich their  
**[0:31:33-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:33):**  environments, the healthier they will be. And also time. So I think time should be almost like a  
**[0:31:43-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:43):**  time footprint. So as well as a carbon footprint, time spent on tasks that perhaps aren't necessary.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:51):**  So at the moment, we try and buy in animals that are sired by polled breeds. So when I mean polled,  
**[0:31:58-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:58):**  obviously ones that don't naturally grow horns, because then we haven't got the need to disbudge  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:04):**  or take those horn buds out. So there's time saved, there's lower stress on the animal.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:10):**  Obviously we use pain relief to do that, but we're also reducing the medicines that we need to do  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:16):**  that. So I think things like that that we can do easily, which actually are saving us money,  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:23):**  and actually mean that the animals never set back, there's less intervention. But there are still a  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:27):**  lot of unanswered questions and we need more, I feel, we need more research on this. So what do  
**[0:32:33-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:33):**  we really know about the immune status of these animals? Have we actually done trials where an  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:40):**  animal, particularly for cattle, we might have done on hens and smaller animals, but on cattle,  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:46):**  what do we really know about their gut microbiomes? Is the way they're reared, is rearing on the cow  
**[0:32:53-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:53):**  versus artificial rearing on milk powder? Are there differences? Maybe the differences to start  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:00):**  with, but do those differences carry on through later life? So when these animals are three or  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:05):**  four years old, is there still a difference? That should be part of the analysis when you're looking  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:11):**  at costs and how systems are run. So I think we need to follow these cattle through more,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:16):**  and rather than just looking at them in snapshot trials, actually build up real knowledge over  
**[0:33:21-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:21):**  their lifetime. That's really fascinating. And of course, that whole genetics piece, genetics and  
**[0:33:25-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:25):**  breeding and the environmental benefits associated with that, I think are really interesting.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:29):**  And then of course, there's just kind of the straightforward stuff like providing trees or  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:34):**  big hedges for shelter and developing a good sward. There are clearly carbon benefits and  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:39):**  biodiversity benefits to doing that as well. So David, just finally, when we spoke before  
**[0:33:45-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:45):**  the recording, you talked about the way in which learned emotions can be passed on between different  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:51):**  generations of farm animals. Now, is this emotional behaviour learned from parents,  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:56):**  or is it passed on genetically? So there's been some fun, interesting work about how learning  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:03):**  about bad, good and bad experiences. So for example, there's been some nice little work  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:07):**  in chickens, which show that basically the basics of empathy, that they are observing bad behaviours  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:13):**  in other animals and learning to avoid, etc. So there is definitely learning between animals.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:19):**  But there's also these kind of have cross-generational effects,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:23):**  particularly bad experiences, very stressful experiences, or even starvation events,  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:29):**  those sorts of extreme events, you can demonstrate effects in subsequent generations.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:34):**  So that's called an epigenetic effect, which is really not just the genes themselves,  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:39):**  it's something about the environment that has affected that animal that is passed on.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:43):**  So that effect has been shown in pigs, for example, in their stress reactions. It's also  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:48):**  something that has actually been observed in human populations that have been exposed to extreme  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:53):**  stress, starvation reactions. So we're only just getting to grips with this, the complexity of the  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:59):**  emotional state, how sensitive we are to different situations, and animals have exactly the same  
**[0:35:04-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:04):**  level of complexity as we do. I mean, that is quite a mind-blowing thing to end on, really,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:11):**  and you know, we don't have time to go into the detail of it. But the idea that these emotional  
**[0:35:16-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:16):**  reactions are actually something that get embedded in genetics, passed on generation to generation,  
**[0:35:23-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:23):**  I mean, you know, quite aside from farm animals, the idea that that could be taking place in humans  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:28):**  as well, if you grow up on a council estate that has particular, you know, sort of pockets  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:33):**  of poverty, if you grow up in a war zone, that there can be impacts that are generational.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:38):**  I mean, the implications there are really pretty enormous.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:42):**  Yes, yes, they are indeed. And it's an example of how working with understanding animals in their  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:48):**  environment and what affects them can actually help humans too. We're animals too, funnily enough.

### Farm Gate  (2021-09-21)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Fenlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell. Do farm animals  experience emotions? Or are the behaviours people perceive as emotions purely an instinctive  response? Animal welfare science is well advanced, based on the principle that all animals experience  
**[0:00:21-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:21):**  pleasure and pain, and that all animals should have the opportunity to express natural behaviours.  But are farm animals really emotional? For example, do cows feel happy or depressed?  And does it really matter? Should a farm animal's ability to react instinctively or respond  
**[0:00:37-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:37):**  emotionally affect the way that we care for and handle livestock?  I'm joined by two experts in the field. Professor David Main is a veterinary surgeon and professor  of production of animal health and welfare at the Royal Agricultural University. Rachel  
**[0:00:50-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:00:50):**  Hauler is a cattle farmer for Mondross Farm in Somerset, who helped as part of the RAU's  farmer working group on a project to develop a positive welfare framework. Welcome both.  Hello. Hi.  
**[0:01:01-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:01):**  David, from an academic or physiological perspective, what's the difference between instinct and  emotion? Instincts are things, behaviours that animals  do that they don't need to learn about, that are the basis of their genes and their environment,  
**[0:01:16-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:16):**  etc, that they just do and always do, and they don't have to have prior learning. Whereas  emotion, of course, is about the feeling, the good or the bad emotional sense that an  animal has in response to an environment. So an animal will be showing an instinctive  
**[0:01:34-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:34):**  behaviour, avoiding something, but that may or may not be associated with an emotional  sense. So is choice part of that? I mean, you've  specialised in farm animal welfare across your career. And so how do we know that farm  
**[0:01:48-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:01:48):**  animals are experiencing emotions and that these behaviours that we're observing aren't  simply just instinctive responses? Yeah, there's been quite a lot of effort  in the scientific literature to understand the emotional state of the animals. I mean,  
**[0:02:02-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:02):**  one can get all philosophical about this and start thinking, well, actually I'm not going  to... Please do, you know.  Even for people, we don't really know what's going on in other people's heads at any one  
**[0:02:12-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:12):**  time. But actually the physiological neuroanatomy behaviours that animals are showing match  so closely onto our emotional responses that it's highly likely that they are emotional  responses. And of course, from an evolutionary point of view, the point of consciousness,  
**[0:02:33-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:33):**  did consciousness suddenly arrive with humans? No, consciousness is an evolutionary advantage  that many other animals are experiencing. So yeah, the way that animals respond, they  respond predictably to positive and negative experiences, gives us a pretty good indication  
**[0:02:53-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:02:53):**  that they are experiencing emotions. So if we take that sort of philosophical view  that you introduced there, then I don't know if you're feeling anything emotionally. I  can't know that for sure. But I know that I'm feeling something and that I'm reacting  
**[0:03:08-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:08):**  to something and because your brain is wired similarly and because large animals, for example,  have similar wiring, from that perspective, we can take a pretty good bet that they experience  emotions. Yeah, that's good. Exactly that. And the point  
**[0:03:24-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:24):**  is we can then predict. We can predict how humans are going to behave and we can predict  how animals are going to behave in similar circumstances. So it gives us a pretty good  idea that they are experiencing similarly bad things that they don't like and similarly  
**[0:03:37-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:37):**  good things that they would choose to access, giving us an indication of what things that  they like as well as which things that they want to avoid and that are aversive.  So when I framed that last question to you, it was around large animals because I think  
**[0:03:52-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:03:52):**  if we see an animal that's a similar size to us, give or take, then it's easier to kind  of assume that they experience something in a relatively similar way. But is there a difference  between species? So for example, do chickens or do fish experience emotion in the same  
**[0:04:06-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:06):**  way that larger animals like cattle and sheep do?  We don't know. We never will know exactly what it is to experience from their point  of view. And that is likely never going to be the case. But we know from an analogy that  
**[0:04:20-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:20):**  they're likely to feel similar positive and negative emotions. Exactly how that is played  out is difficult to know. I think going back to philosophy, if you like, that Jeremy Bentham,  famous philosopher, talked about animals, whether it's not a question of whether they  
**[0:04:36-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:36):**  reason, it's a question of, or talk, it's a question of whether they suffer. And certainly  from a moral perspective, how we look after farm animals crucially is whether they can  suffer and what things we can provide. And as I'm sure we're going to talk about in a  
**[0:04:50-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:04:50):**  minute, is what things that they like too also has a role to play in seeing how we should  care for animals.  So we talked there about the way the brain is and the ability to suffer, but I'm wondering  
**[0:05:01-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:01):**  if there are sort of experiments that you're aware of with, you know, chicken or fish or  larger animals that have helped to demonstrate that emotional response, that emotional side  of the behaviour.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:12):**  Yes. So a good example is what they, they're increased sensitivity in a pain state. So  animals can be subjected to pain during husbandry procedures, et cetera. And these animals remember  those circumstances and avoid those similar situations, showing that it's aversive as you  
**[0:05:32-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:32):**  like. And they're also showed high sensitivity because the physiology of the pain system  is that you become hypersensitive. And so they show the similar hypersensitivity as  people do. There's one infamous experiment, maybe this is a diversion, but I can tell  
**[0:05:47-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:05:47):**  you anyway. And that's around the pain associated with circumcision in babies. In babies, it  was assumed that circumcision wasn't a painful operation, but they had some babies that we  circumcised with or without local anaesthetic and that they could see several months later  
**[0:06:06-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:06):**  when these babies were then given their routine vaccinations is that those babies that had  had circumcision without local anaesthetic, their pain reactions, their vocalisations  were much more extreme than if they hadn't had it. So indicating that it was a painful  
**[0:06:24-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:24):**  event that they experienced, that local anaesthetic was a better thing to do. And it actually  persists for quite a long time, for several months.  Jason Vale-  
**[0:06:44-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:06:44):**  Well, firstly I just would just like to sort of set the scene in terms of where I'm coming  from, as a farmer in this conversation. So we're farming about 78 hectares down in Somerset  on the coastal levels, which is adjacent to the Bristol Channel below sea level. Over  
**[0:07:01-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:01):**  a third of the farm has got herbal multi-species glaze sown and we're finishing native side organic  cattle at about 22 to 24 months off of grass and forage. This has replaced what was a dairy system,  so we were dairy up until two years ago. Most of our stores are bought as weaned, but we seem to  
**[0:07:20-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:20):**  have accrued a dozen suckler cows, which is interesting because I do remember having  conversations saying we weren't going to have suckler cows. We seem to have got a dozen here,  which I think have filled the emotional hole left by our dairy cows leaving, which is interesting.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:35):**  So that was your emotional hole?  I think so. I think we needed some cows to just have on the farm, just as a sort of backstop,  so we'd go and have a scratch with them. So that was interesting in itself. Yeah, so examples of  
**[0:07:49-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:07:49):**  why I think cattle are emotional creatures. Last weekend, actually, we went to visit some friends  up in Shropshire who bought a couple of our dairy heifers two years ago. So these heifers have been  on the farm for about six to eight months with us and then they moved to Shropshire to these friends.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:05):**  So we walked into the field after lunch to go and see the cows. We went in with some other people  and one of these heifers actually strode up to me and literally sort of headbutted me and wanted  a scratch. Of course, I reciprocated and I scratched the cow. And yes, I can't deny a little  
**[0:08:25-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:25):**  tear in my eye to think that she recognised me. Then I thought perhaps I'm being silly and she  didn't recognise me. And I turned around to the other lady behind me and said, well, that was  weird, wasn't it? Do you think she recognised me? And she said, well, she didn't do it to me. And I  
**[0:08:38-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:38):**  walked past her, you know, I can't prove that, can I? But it was very interesting. And yeah,  it was nice to think that she recognised me and we did. Yeah, she had some scratches and she then  went off to eat. So that, you know, maybe that's in emotion. There's also other examples I can  
**[0:08:55-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:08:55):**  give. The time in February when the grass down here in Somerset just starts to grow,  starts to green up. The cows seem to be able to smell it and they put their heads and noses over  the wall of the yards where they're housed over the winter. And this is the time of year that you  
**[0:09:10-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:10):**  got to be very careful not to leave a gate open by mistake or unlutched, because they will escape  out into the field. But when it is their time to go out, there is certainly some play behaviour.  And I believe in Denmark and other countries, they actually do this as a day for the nation to come  
**[0:09:26-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:26):**  and watch the cows being turned out. Now you could argue, well, yeah, they're pleased to be out to  eat the grass. But then why run round on it and play around on it? Why don't they just put their  heads down and eat? There's obviously something going on there that they are enjoying being out  
**[0:09:40-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:40):**  in the field for the first time in the spring. And if you've got that sort of smell response  that you were talking about there, then that, you know, that's sort of creeping in for days or for  the weeks before they are let out. And that sort of sense of excitement must be building. And then,  
**[0:09:54-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:09:54):**  you know, when you open the gate, the dam bursts. I think so. And I think we all experience it when  we say, oh, I think spring is starting to come because there's a little birdsong and there's  some of the soil smells a bit different. And there are triggers. We all feel it. So why wouldn't  
**[0:10:09-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:09):**  a cow feel it? They also show curiosity and fear. And sometimes they can do those two together. So  if you go into a field, a new person goes into the field of cattle and just stands there,  the cattle will come up quite curiously and they sort of timidly come up to you. And then  
**[0:10:27-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:27):**  if you just stand still, they'll come up and start licking you or get close. But if you perhaps move  your hand or brush your hair away or take your coat off, they jump back and then they start creeping  up again. So that's, I think that's an emotion. That's a curious fear. So there are lots of  
**[0:10:43-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:43):**  examples when I think it's just spending the time to stop and think about them. And then you realise  there are quite a lot of examples of that. And there's a degree to which if it was  instinctive behaviour, then they'd all do basically the same thing, kind of at the same time when  
**[0:10:56-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:10:56):**  they're reacting to something. And, you know, I know when I walk through a field of cows,  that you've got cows that are more confident or a little bit stroppier, a little bit more friendly,  a little bit more curious. And there is that sort of that emotional diversity within a herd.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:10):**  Joanna  There is. And I think there's probably something more that David did comment on,  the different, I was trying to think about it myself. How do we differ  
**[0:11:18-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:18):**  characters and characteristics and personalities? But there are, they do have different likes and  dislikes. And there are some that are bolder than others. That makes part of the job that we do  more interesting. It wouldn't be dull if they were all the same.  
**[0:11:32-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:32):**  David Now, you've spent 25 years, as you said, as a dairy farmer, and dairy farms now are getting  bigger and bigger, as increasingly they get consolidated. Do you think that farmers are  less able to give cows a good life and respond to their emotional needs on these large farms of 500  
**[0:11:49-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:11:49):**  or 800 cows? Joanna  I don't think it's a case of large herds versus small herds argument. I don't think that's  relevant. I think what's important is how that farm is managed and how that unit is managed,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:02):**  particularly based on what resources they've got. So labour availability and the time available to  spend with cows and with the cattle on that farm is probably the limiting factor. So having time  out in the day and the routines of actually being with the cows and not having to do a job, so  
**[0:12:21-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:21):**  having time to look over the gate and actually look and see what's happening with the cows rather  than head down on the tractor scraping, doing some milking, doing time out of the job in terms of  actually looking at the cows and having a sufficient number of people. So it's an ongoing  
**[0:12:39-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:39):**  challenge at the moment. And it's a very difficult one. Stockkeepers need to be consistent. So having  the right people trained up to follow the same protocols is equally important. But also it can  be, you know, there is a sort of converse argument in actually a very small herd of cows managed by  
**[0:12:57-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:12:57):**  one person, 365 days a year. Those cows actually might have problems with strangers coming onto the  farm or say a vet comes on the farm because they actually have had less socialisation. So they  haven't been used to lots of new people. And they'll find that stranger interaction more  
**[0:13:16-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:16):**  stressful. So I don't think it's a large versus small argument. And I guess if there's just in  that scenario where you've just got one farmer, then, you know, if they're coming up against  things that they don't understand or they haven't encountered before, then their knowledge base is  
**[0:13:30-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:30):**  smaller, I suppose, than if you've got several stock people there. So I think that what you're  saying is it doesn't really matter if it's a really big farm or a relatively small farm. It's  about the stock person ratio, stock person cow ratio, and making sure that there's some consistency,  
**[0:13:46-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:13:46):**  that the people who are looking after the cows are genuinely tending to their needs, which is  really interesting. So if we take that size issue, I guess there's a system issue as well.  And so the question is really around sort of fully indoor permanently housed cattle and seasonally  
**[0:14:01-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:01):**  grazed cattle. And this issue comes up a lot in dairy, particularly now where there is an ever  greater intensification and sort of more indoor herds in Britain, is whether or not cows need  grass. And bearing in mind those emotional needs that we've been discussing, what do you think?  
**[0:14:17-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:17):**  I think it's a simple question, but quite a complicated answer. I don't think it's about  do cows need grass, more that it's about enriched environments. So I don't think it's a out at grass  versus housed argument per se. You could argue that cows that go out in a field with no diversity  
**[0:14:36-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:36):**  in the sward, so they've only got grass, just one variety of grass to eat. If they got no shelter  from inclement weather, they've got no enriched things to play with or, you know, good tracks,  that would probably be no better than a really good enriched environment indoors, which has got  
**[0:14:54-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:14:54):**  say different things to walk on, straw yards, loafing areas outside. You see a lot of brushes  now on dairy units, toys, scratching posts. The last winter we put in large tree stumps in our  housed area for them to play with and actually we moved those around as well so it became novel  
**[0:15:14-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:14):**  experiences. So I think the answer should be the environment should match what resources there are.  So it would be wrong to out winter cows at grass all year round in Derbyshire on heavy soils,  because that would be not fair on the cows in terms of the conditions and the protection from  
**[0:15:32-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:32):**  the elements. So I think it's sort of bespoke. I think it should be resources match what's there  and make that indoor environment as close to a natural environment as you possibly can.  So it's starting from the cows, starting from the land resource that you have and the human resource  
**[0:15:51-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:15:51):**  that you have and designing your farm system, a bespoke farm system around that.  Yes, yes, it's not, I don't think it's a one size fits all answer.  Have you noticed a shift in the expectations of your customers as people have become more aware  
**[0:16:05-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:05):**  of farm animal welfare as an issue and, you know, I've come to understand it better over  the course of the last 30 years or so? Yeah, so there has been a shift,  there's no getting away from that. But I also think that now farms, we are audited,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:21):**  we actually have three audits a year. So our organic audit, our retractor audit,  and other welfare schemes. So I think it's almost like they don't, they're probably worrying overly  now when actually probably the worries should have been three decades ago. So I think we've come on  
**[0:16:37-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:37):**  leaps and bounds. So I think but I actually, you know, as I said before, we actually enjoy  speaking to our, and we haven't got direct customers, but we actually enjoy interacting  with ultimately, everyone who eats, eats up, you know, meat or dairy or milk. They are customers,  
**[0:16:53-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:16:53):**  aren't they? So yes, I think they're right to put an emphasis on that. And I don't think we've got  anything to fear in terms of keeping up. And I think we're doing a lot more, we just need to  shout about it more. And as a farmer yourself, how do you think an understanding of animals  
**[0:17:10-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:10):**  as sentient, emotional creatures should change the way that we rear and treat livestock? Does  it influence the way that you farm? There's a lot of things. Yeah, I've sort of  three things straight away about what we do with this in mind. So for example, if we're talking  
**[0:17:27-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:27):**  about social needs of cattle, we tend to rear our, so if we're calf rearing, we always rear our  calves in even numbers. So I think it's a known fact that having observed calves in research  experiments that they actually buddy up with a mate quite early on in life. And so if we're  
**[0:17:47-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:17:47):**  keeping them in twos or fours or eights or sixteens, they're always with a friend, so to  speak. So that's something that we do. And also we try and rear in that social group, we try and  avoid mixing too much or too regularly as well. So try and once they go into that group, they stay  
**[0:18:05-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:05):**  in that group. So it's a little bit like, we wouldn't expect children all going back to school  now, we wouldn't expect our children to move class every term and mix all the classes up, would we?  They actually stay in that cohort group right the way through school. And there's a reason for that  
**[0:18:20-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:20):**  is because they make friends. And I don't think that's any different with cattle. We used to,  when we had the dairy cows, a milk recorder, so someone would come onto the farm once a month,  and record the milk yield per cow that each cow gives. And to do that, she has to write down the  
**[0:18:37-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:37):**  numbers of the cows. So when the cow calves for the first time, she's given a unique number.  And if they carve, obviously, when the same, roughly the same age, they'll have consecutive  numbers. One of our milk recorders used to play something called cow bingo. So when those cows  
**[0:18:53-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:18:53):**  came into the parlour, if she had a like three consecutive numbers, like two, three and four,  stand next to each other in the parlour, that would be cow bingo, the ultimate would be say  four in a row. And actually, it was surprising how often that would happen. And why are we  
**[0:19:08-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:08):**  surprised because yeah, they would come in with their mates, and they obviously worked out what  order they would would come in. And they could also tell which cows come in first, quite often  the same cows would come in the first part of the milking and then the same ones at the end.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:22):**  And actually, it's little things like that, that a farmer will notice. And when can number 15 is  last come in the parlour, where it usually comes in in the first half an hour, that would raise  alarm bells and they then they'd act on that, that information. So there's obviously something  
**[0:19:37-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:37):**  perhaps not quite right with that cow. So it's it's almost a subconscious thing from the farmer  point of view. And the other things we do is just if we've got new experiences, so training cows to  the coming into the milking parlour, we allow time for them to learn and adapt to do that we don't  
**[0:19:54-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:19:54):**  expect them to do a new thing straight away. And there's the same thing could be applied to people  couldn't it and making their environments interesting. I think recent lockdowns have  probably highlighted the need that people need more than just food, water and shelter.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:09):**  They need interaction, they need exercise, and they need opportunities for play.  David, there must be some kind of a link between positive welfare and productivity. Are you aware  of any examples of that? Certainly, I think that there are lots of examples of industries making  
**[0:20:24-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:24):**  very financially motivated decisions based on things that animals want and choose to do. And  for example, Temple Grand in America has done some great work in abattoirs, which is really focusing  on the behavioural choice of what cows would choose to do in an abattoir and showing that  
**[0:20:40-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:40):**  that actually leads to better outcomes for increased meat quality, etc. And there's a  really nice example of chickens. I mean, chickens production, the mantra for producing meat chickens  is that you have a one shared, you have a very uniform production system, same light patterns,  
**[0:20:57-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:20:57):**  same food, because these are very similar chickens, they all need the same thing.  And they don't need behavioural choice. But actually some interesting work to show that  like their ancestors, the red jungle fowl, actually chickens do quite like and choose to have  
**[0:21:13-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:13):**  different types of light, different light patterns. So they in commercial chicken systems, they've  provided different amounts of light within a shed and actually it showed increased growth rate,  increase and improve food conversion ratio, just providing that diversity of light. And who would  
**[0:21:33-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:33):**  have thought it that providing behavioural choice like that would actually increase  a commercial measure such as growth rate. So let's watch what the animals do and work with them.  Thanks, David. I mentioned earlier, Rachel, that you helped as part of the Royal Agricultural  
**[0:21:49-0:22:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:21:49):**  University's Farmer Working Group on a new positive welfare framework. What sort of things  were being measured in the pilot scheme that you were part of? So the audit, so as a dairy farmer,  we formed a little invited to form a focus group with other other farmers, and we actually  
**[0:22:05-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:05):**  brainstorm areas of a cow's life, so to speak, that will, we felt was contributed to a good life.  So we tried to pick out areas that were key to contributing to a good life that formed a  framework. So those sections are physical environment. So that could be the flooring or  
**[0:22:22-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:22):**  the bedding. It could be the thermal environment. So how cold or hot or draughty somewhere was,  it looked at play, social interactions, maternal cow-calf bonding, calves learning from their  mothers, interactions with stockkeepers, that was a really important one we felt had to be in there,  
**[0:22:44-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:22:44):**  access to pasture, feed choices, health and welfare, and observation and monitoring. So  we looked at how in tune, you know, farmers were with the cows in terms of their behaviour and  picking up problems before they arose almost. And the important thing about the framework  
**[0:23:01-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:01):**  is that it could be applied to all types of systems. So it's a list of questions as to what  the cows have access to, but it can be those questions can be applied to all different sorts  of system. So my role really, for helping with this was to translate the science which David  
**[0:23:16-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:16):**  and his team had come up with, and translate that into a sort of farmer friendly language. So it  could be actually out those questions could be asked on farm without the need of a bit of  interpretation. Go on, give us an example of where the academics just got it wrong and they  
**[0:23:31-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:31):**  needed to re-translate it into farmer speak. They didn't get it wrong, but there was probably things  like affiliative behaviour and licking or something. And I said, what does that actually  mean? And they said, well, it just means the cows are just grooming each other and playing. So,  
**[0:23:48-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:23:48):**  so yeah, so locomotor, we know we said that. I must use that phrase when my kids are playing  and mucking around later. I was telling them that's affiliative behaviour.  Locomotor and things like that. It's like, do you mean running? Yes, we probably mean running.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:04):**  Okay, why don't we just put running then? So things like that. So it was a, yeah, it was a  really enjoyable piece of work to help with. So what stage David is RAU at now with the  Positive Welfare Framework? And how is it going to be used?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:18):**  We don't know the answer to that is because it is being further developed and tested specifically  with DEFRA at the moment. They're exploring options for UK agricultural policy in the  animal health and welfare pathway, which involves financial incentives to farmers  
**[0:24:34-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:34):**  to improve welfare. So the concept is being explored to understand farmers' attitudes to it,  the financial costs of providing different things. And yeah, so that could inform that.  So, so is the Positive Welfare Framework potentially going to be something that helps the  
**[0:24:50-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:24:50):**  farm payments for better welfare? Indeed, indeed. Exactly. That's, that's what  it could be used for. I mean, at the end of the day, it is really also a communication tool  for farmers to share with others about what good stuff they're doing. And that can work at all  
**[0:25:02-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:02):**  sorts of levels, you know, farmers sharing ideas of best practice between other farmers.  But also another potential use that sort of relates to that policy end is that different  countries want to describe that they're how well they are doing in animal welfare policy terms.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:19):**  You often hear about, you know, UK is world leading in animal welfare, and so say New Zealand,  and so say Denmark, and you know, you hear it in many, many places at the moment. That's primarily  based on legislation, which is a pretty rough measure of animal welfare performance. And so  
**[0:25:35-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:35):**  positive welfare can help help with that. So that's something else that we're including in  the policy debates at the moment, because we, the national governments do want to share notes about  how well they're doing. And the positive welfare framework is potentially relevant at many different  
**[0:25:50-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:25:50):**  levels from policy through to farmers. And fundamentally, it is about being able to  communicate how well farmers are caring for their animals. And within that framework, I mean, you  talk about being able to compare with other countries and have some sort of objective measure.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:04):**  Does that mean that they're scoring within the framework that farmers can do better or worse?  We're quite careful, actually, we've never gone down the route of really adding it up,  because actually, they're quite difficult. They're measuring very different things. And it's a quite  
**[0:26:19-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:19):**  scientifically controversial to add them up and say one thing is more important than the other,  or twice as important as something else. So it's actually, we would prefer to think of it as more  of a discussion tool. This concept is important, and this concept is important, and there's  
**[0:26:33-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:33):**  different ways of doing this and different ways of doing that, and share ideas. So really, the idea  about positive welfare is to ensure that the good things in life are captured and valued, rather than  turning on its head and having another way of nagging farmers. That's not the intention of the  
**[0:26:51-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:26:51):**  exercise. Now, you've been involved in developing various farm animal welfare frameworks in the past.  Do you think they're effective drivers of change? And actually, as a sort of subsidiary question,  who generally funds this kind of research? Where does the incentive come from to investigate these  
**[0:27:06-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:06):**  sorts of things? Is the push coming from customers or from retailers or from government? Where's it  coming from? It's generally coming from all angles. I mean, let's take citizens, and I say that not  because you might say citizens, voting people that influence politicians, and they're quite clearly  
**[0:27:23-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:23):**  animal welfare is on the agenda. So that's why we're talking about financial incentives.  In the marketplace, it's either consumers seek out higher welfare, or even if they're not doing that,  they are choosing retailers that they trust, and retailers are making their purchasing decisions.  
**[0:27:40-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:27:40):**  And then, of course, as well as the retailers in the industry trying to deliver what they  expect their consumers to want, animal welfare charities, etc, have got an interest in promoting  these ideas. So the funding has come from a range of those interested parties. It's not like the  
**[0:28:00-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:00):**  old days, whereas animal welfare was a bad thing, and the industry was being defensive and trying to  stop all these bad stories. Genuinely, I see government, industry and civil society groups  genuinely having a debate about how best to improve welfare and communicate that to their  
**[0:28:17-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:17):**  customers or citizens. Which seems to indicate to me that these frameworks that you've been  developing over the course of the last decade, or two or three, they are effective drivers of  change, partly because they're able to communicate what it is that's expected and communicate the  
**[0:28:32-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:32):**  sort of change that's necessary. Exactly. Communication is critical, but sometimes,  actually, that activity doesn't, the communication happens at different levels. So, for example,  the work we've done on welfare outcome assessments, which is seeing how well, often, how healthy  
**[0:28:46-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:28:46):**  animals are in laying hens and dairy, etc. That's obviously often a conversation between the  farmer assurance scheme and the farmer, and actually not so much between the customer. The  customer sees the logo on the packet and says, well, it's Red Tractor or RSPC assured or organic,  
**[0:29:01-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:01):**  whatever it is, and they have trust in that. So, that's the key communication vehicle to the  customer. But there is more detailed communication happening at the farmer end, which is about how  many lent cows you've got, what the feather losses in your chickens are about. So, it's communication  
**[0:29:17-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:17):**  at different levels, and that communication needs to be relevant to that particular audience.  Now, a different framework that you've been involved in in the past is a sure well,  and that was developing outcome-based assessments, which could then be sort of bolted on or integrated  
**[0:29:31-0:29:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:31):**  within kind of Red Tractor assessments, for example, that sort of thing. Are you expecting  the positive welfare framework to be used in a similar sort of way, or is it performing a  different function? I think in due course, I think it could be, yes. The sure well welfare  
**[0:29:44-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:29:44):**  outcome stuff is embedded into laying hen systems, dairy systems, pig systems, and those conversations  are already happening and data is being collected. And also improvements in welfare outcomes is being  demonstrated in all those sectors. On the positive welfare side, I think it's also often not about  
**[0:30:03-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:03):**  farmer-to-farmer assessments, as we've been talking about. It is actually also very relevant  for looking at standards development, where different standards of different farm assurance  schemes need to move on to. So that's a different level of communication, and that is, it is already  
**[0:30:19-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:19):**  being used for those discussions. Rachel, coming back to you and just sort of thinking for a moment  about broader sustainability, and part of my work has been about looking at the link between animal  health and welfare and the environment. And so from your own experience on the farm and from  
**[0:30:34-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:34):**  your work with RAU, do you think that there is also a link between positive welfare experience,  good emotional experience, and good environmental outcomes? Yes, yeah, undoubtedly yes. If a dairy  animal has a longer and healthier life, she's going to require a lot less resources than  
**[0:30:52-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:30:52):**  something that doesn't, the cow that doesn't. So there's less wasted inputs, and likewise for  a beef animal, it might grow faster from less feed, so its feed efficiency is more efficient  if it's not set back. So for example, if we bought 20 beef animals from 20 different farms,  
**[0:31:11-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:11):**  I am certain that their productivity in terms of feed efficiency would be a lot worse than 20  animals from one farm. So just by the fact that we're mixing those animals, not purely from a  disease point of view, but from a social point of view, they've all got their social groups and  
**[0:31:27-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:27):**  their social hierarchy. So the more we can make their life, give them more choice and enrich their  environments, the healthier they will be. And also time. So I think time should be almost like a  time footprint. So as well as a carbon footprint, time spent on tasks that perhaps aren't necessary.  
**[0:31:51-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:31:51):**  So at the moment, we try and buy in animals that are sired by polled breeds. So when I mean polled,  obviously ones that don't naturally grow horns, because then we haven't got the need to disbudge  or take those horn buds out. So there's time saved, there's lower stress on the animal.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:10):**  Obviously we use pain relief to do that, but we're also reducing the medicines that we need to do  that. So I think things like that that we can do easily, which actually are saving us money,  and actually mean that the animals never set back, there's less intervention. But there are still a  
**[0:32:27-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:27):**  lot of unanswered questions and we need more, I feel, we need more research on this. So what do  we really know about the immune status of these animals? Have we actually done trials where an  animal, particularly for cattle, we might have done on hens and smaller animals, but on cattle,  
**[0:32:46-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:32:46):**  what do we really know about their gut microbiomes? Is the way they're reared, is rearing on the cow  versus artificial rearing on milk powder? Are there differences? Maybe the differences to start  with, but do those differences carry on through later life? So when these animals are three or  
**[0:33:05-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:05):**  four years old, is there still a difference? That should be part of the analysis when you're looking  at costs and how systems are run. So I think we need to follow these cattle through more,  and rather than just looking at them in snapshot trials, actually build up real knowledge over  
**[0:33:21-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:21):**  their lifetime. That's really fascinating. And of course, that whole genetics piece, genetics and  breeding and the environmental benefits associated with that, I think are really interesting.  And then of course, there's just kind of the straightforward stuff like providing trees or  
**[0:33:34-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:34):**  big hedges for shelter and developing a good sward. There are clearly carbon benefits and  biodiversity benefits to doing that as well. So David, just finally, when we spoke before  the recording, you talked about the way in which learned emotions can be passed on between different  
**[0:33:51-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:33:51):**  generations of farm animals. Now, is this emotional behaviour learned from parents,  or is it passed on genetically? So there's been some fun, interesting work about how learning  about bad, good and bad experiences. So for example, there's been some nice little work  
**[0:34:07-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:07):**  in chickens, which show that basically the basics of empathy, that they are observing bad behaviours  in other animals and learning to avoid, etc. So there is definitely learning between animals.  But there's also these kind of have cross-generational effects,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:23):**  particularly bad experiences, very stressful experiences, or even starvation events,  those sorts of extreme events, you can demonstrate effects in subsequent generations.  So that's called an epigenetic effect, which is really not just the genes themselves,  
**[0:34:39-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:39):**  it's something about the environment that has affected that animal that is passed on.  So that effect has been shown in pigs, for example, in their stress reactions. It's also  something that has actually been observed in human populations that have been exposed to extreme  
**[0:34:53-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:34:53):**  stress, starvation reactions. So we're only just getting to grips with this, the complexity of the  emotional state, how sensitive we are to different situations, and animals have exactly the same  level of complexity as we do. I mean, that is quite a mind-blowing thing to end on, really,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:11):**  and you know, we don't have time to go into the detail of it. But the idea that these emotional  reactions are actually something that get embedded in genetics, passed on generation to generation,  I mean, you know, quite aside from farm animals, the idea that that could be taking place in humans  
**[0:35:28-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:28):**  as well, if you grow up on a council estate that has particular, you know, sort of pockets  of poverty, if you grow up in a war zone, that there can be impacts that are generational.  I mean, the implications there are really pretty enormous.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Are-farm-animals-emotional-e17lb41#t=0:35:42):**  Yes, yes, they are indeed. And it's an example of how working with understanding animals in their  environment and what affects them can actually help humans too. We're animals too, funnily enough.  So let's watch and learn. That's been really interesting. Thanks so much. But that's all

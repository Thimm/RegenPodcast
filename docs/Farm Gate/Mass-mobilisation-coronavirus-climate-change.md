### Farm Gate  (Mon, 04 May 2020 17:12:40)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Logue-Kustein.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:09):**  The coronavirus pandemic has generated a monumental response from governments and the general  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:14):**  public alike. Political parties philosophically opposed to the big state have reversed their  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:20):**  laissez-faire principles and intervened in our lives to an enormous extent. Our freedoms  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:25):**  have been removed by various states of lockdown, billions have been borrowed and spent, and  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:31):**  in many countries the government is now paying at least some of the wages of ordinary citizens.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:36):**  In January, hardly anyone had heard of Covid-19. Now many of us think of little else. This  
**[0:00:43-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:43):**  is partly down to a combination of the infectious and dangerous nature of the virus itself,  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:48):**  and partly to government decisions and communications. But the media has also ramped up the jeopardy  
**[0:00:54-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:00:54):**  and society itself has, at least for now, been generally co-operating.  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:00):**  So the question for this podcast is, what can we learn from the way that Covid-19 has  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:05):**  been communicated and the speed of society's response? And how can we apply this knowledge  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:11):**  to other public health emergencies such as climate change and biodiversity loss, which  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:16):**  perhaps present fewer immediate risks, but which in the medium term also threaten the  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:21):**  existence of human society as we know it? I'll be speaking to Jason Wojciechowski,  
**[0:01:27-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:27):**  a senior fellow at the Centre for Impact Communication, and Oystein Torson, the director of FAI Farms.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:34):**  Hello both. Perhaps you could introduce yourselves and talk briefly about your interest in this  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:39):**  area. Jason.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:40):**  Jason Wojciechowski, Senior Fellow, Centre for Impact Communication,  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:41):**  Finland  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:42):**  Finland, thanks so much for having me. Exciting to be talking to you today. Yeah, at the Centre  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:46):**  for Impact Communication, we look at communication and specifically how communication drives  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:51):**  social change and impact across a range of issues. And our latest project is Communicating  
**[0:01:57-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:01:57):**  Coronavirus, where we are pulling together, synthesizing best practices on this pandemic.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:04):**  I'm Oystein Torson. I'm the director of FAI Farms. And communicating science is something  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:10):**  we think about every day because our work is driven by three sets of values. One is  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:15):**  the purpose and impact and wanting to make a difference. All the people that work for  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:20):**  FAI do it because they believe in what we do and want to make a change. And then secondly,  
**[0:02:26-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:26):**  we're science led. So everything we do is also focused on the scientific method, knowing  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:31):**  the best science. And thirdly, we're client focused, so we want to deliver value to the  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:36):**  people that we work with. So being able to communicate what science says and then practically  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:42):**  applying it with purpose in the real world is sort of our everyday craft.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:46):**  Fantastic. Thank you both. So Jason, you've been collating and putting together knowledge  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:52):**  around the way that coronavirus has been communicated to the public. Tell us some of the things,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:02:58):**  some of the top line findings that you've come across.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:01):**  Yeah, absolutely. It's a really interesting time to be looking at this because health  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:06):**  crises have very direct outcomes, right? You can tell right away what's working and what's  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:11):**  not working, much like you can see the curve flattening or not flattening. And in all communication,  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:16):**  really, but especially in a health crisis, there's two key elements. One is trust and  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:21):**  one is action. Do people trust the messengers and is the message that they're giving them  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:26):**  driving them to act in a way that stops the spread of the virus in this case?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:31):**  So that's really interesting. You're talking about trust and action being linked there.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:35):**  And if we think of your own country, you're speaking from New York, Trump isn't exactly  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:40):**  trusted. Well, certainly not around the world, but not by half of your own countrymen. You  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:45):**  know, almost the opposite. And in our country, different people trust their own political  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:50):**  party or parties that they voted for much more readily than they trust an opposition  
**[0:03:56-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:56):**  party, surely.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:03:57):**  Yeah, that's absolutely right. And one of the recommendations from both the CDC and  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:02):**  the WHO have extensive guidelines on this is to put the scientists forward, let the  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:07):**  doctor speak. And so, you know, with some exceptions we have here in the US, we have  
**[0:04:12-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:12):**  Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, who are those leading scientists. Birx now most famous for  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:19):**  shaking her head in the corner, as Trump talked about, bleach and disinfectants. And the guidance  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:26):**  is to put those scientists forward, let them speak. You know, if you look at Obama's handling  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:31):**  of H1N1U, it's pretty diametrically opposed in the level that he got up there, introduced  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:37):**  the speakers, said the key message and got out of the way, came up again and repeated  
**[0:04:41-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:41):**  the key message. And that was his role.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:43):**  It's interesting, isn't it, that, you know, when you've got the World Health Organization  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:47):**  basically saying to President Trump, look, people aren't going to trust you, therefore,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:51):**  get the scientists out there because people trust scientists and it's kind of no wonder  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:55):**  he's fallen out with them a bit.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:04:57):**  Yeah, it's, it's bound to happen. And, you know, it's been better for everyone that these  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:03):**  scientists have become a bit of celebrities in their own right. And on that piece of trust,  
**[0:05:07-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:07):**  though, you know, I think there are some, some very specific learnings that can be applied  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:11):**  across all science communication and really across probably all communication, because  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:16):**  what actually engenders trust isn't necessarily what you might think it is. A lot of times  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:20):**  what we think about trust and authority in this situation is by, you know, speaking with  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:26):**  in absolutes, having complete knowledge, never showing uncertainty. But what actually the  
**[0:05:31-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:31):**  research shows is that there's a couple of key elements to getting the public on your side  
**[0:05:37-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:37):**  and having real deep trust in what you're saying, which you need when you're asking  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:41):**  them to do pretty bold, life changing actions. So one of the things is don't over reassure.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:47):**  Probably the most dangerous period here in New York and certainly in the UK when Boris  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:52):**  Johnson's government was flirting with the herd immunity is that period where they act  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:05:57):**  like life is going to go on as normal. And that that period went on much longer than  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:00):**  it should have. And what they should have been doing is preparing everyone for what  
**[0:06:04-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:04):**  was to come.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:05):**  And this is what you call anticipatory guidance. Is that right?  
**[0:06:09-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:09):**  Exactly. Anticipatory guidance is just priming people for what's to come. So it's not a shock  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:15):**  to the system so they can prepare. And so they can not be in this kind of limbo where  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:20):**  theatres are wondering, do we put on shows or don't we put on shows? Do we tell people  
**[0:06:24-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:24):**  to come or not come? Here in the US, they went forward with some elections and we already  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:28):**  know dozens of new coronavirus cases in Wisconsin and Michigan that came out of them going forward  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:34):**  with their elections. So you need to say here's what's coming and prepare people for that  
**[0:06:39-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:39):**  change before you lead to it.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:40):**  But that must be really difficult for governments. I mean, you know, I'm remembering it here  
**[0:06:43-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:43):**  in the UK, the way that the herd immunity, you know, we were flirting with that idea.  
**[0:06:48-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:48):**  And in theory, you know, that's it's it's not a bad theory. It's not a bad approach.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:52):**  It just it falls down when it comes into contact with human beings because human beings don't  
**[0:06:57-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:06:57):**  want to be the collateral in that approach. And so when you've got the government dealing  
**[0:07:03-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:03):**  with a crisis, it's something new. They haven't spent as much time as perhaps they should  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:08):**  have done in gaming out in scenarios analysis around what they would do here. They haven't  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:13):**  been investing in in this sort of decision making. And so they are making decisions on  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:17):**  the hoof, so they're bound to get it wrong. And I'm kind of interested that, you know,  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:21):**  I feel like I'm kind of giving the government a bit more of a free pass than perhaps I would  
**[0:07:25-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:25):**  otherwise because, you know, as a citizen, I kind of understand that.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:29):**  Yeah. There's a, you know, infamous John F. Kennedy quote after the Bay of Pigs where  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:34):**  he said, the more you F up in this job, the more they trust you. And there's a there's  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:40):**  two surprising elements in in this research that we've been pulling together, at least  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:44):**  surprising to me. One is that you should embrace change. You know, there's a fear that if you  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:49):**  tell people one thing one day and a few days later, you change it, that you'll have lost  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:53):**  them completely and they'll they'll hold that against you. But the research shows, if you  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:07:57):**  let them know why you're changing it, what new information has come to light that they'll  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:01):**  get on board. And, you know, the mask rollout here in the U.S. was absolutely not perfect.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:07):**  There are a lot of mistakes made. But ultimately, I was walking around New York to go to a store  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:13):**  yesterday and everyone has a mask on. Every store clerk has a mask on. It's and that was  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:18):**  a huge change. They they went from saying, we're never going to ask people to wear masks  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:22):**  in New York. They said, we're never going to ask you to shelter in place. And when they  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:26):**  said, hey, we know we have to change this because asymptomatic people are spreading  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:30):**  the virus. People people trusted that it actually creates more trust. And the other one, which  
**[0:08:34-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:34):**  is, I think, really aligned with what you were saying in the UK situation, that you  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:39):**  shared dilemmas. You share that there's difficult choices and you be open about that. You don't  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:44):**  say we have all the answers and this is the only way to do it. You actually say there's  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:48):**  a few directions we can go. Here's the one we are going to go and here's why. And it's  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:52):**  a difficult choice. In New York, that was really around health care workers who were  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:08:57):**  telling the mayor, keep the schools open because I need to go to my job and I can't do that  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:01):**  if the schools are open. And teachers saying, shut down the schools. We have a lot of immunocompromised  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:06):**  teachers and faculty. And coming out and sharing that dilemma actually created some space to  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:11):**  make the decision to shut down the school.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:13):**  I wonder if that changes over the course of a crisis. You know, as I say, you kind of  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:19):**  got that sort of 10 days or so when the British government was flirting with herd immunity,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:24):**  when it was sharing those dilemmas, as you say, and inviting people to sort of embrace  
**[0:09:30-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:30):**  the fact that they were going to have to, information from government, decisions from  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:33):**  government were going to change. At some point, the schools were going to close. And so there  
**[0:09:37-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:37):**  was that anticipatory guidance that you talk about. But it wasn't happening yet. And then  
**[0:09:42-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:42):**  it came in. And at that point, although it wasn't single messages, it was simple messages  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:48):**  that were coming out. You know, it was stay home, keep the NHS safe. But in the last two  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:53):**  or three weeks, as the lockdown has extended, as people have started feeling more frustrated  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:09:59):**  and bored, I suppose, and now that there's a more effective opposition leader asking  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:04):**  questions, I wonder if things are starting to change. And that single message isn't working  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:10):**  quite so well, that there's almost another stage of communication that the government  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:15):**  somehow needs to move into to sustain public support.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:19):**  You know, and getting people when you share those dilemmas, getting them ultimately on  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:23):**  the side of harsher action, the anchor and all the pandemic research, all the public  
**[0:10:28-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:28):**  health research, you know, really the top line you see in every paper you read on this  
**[0:10:32-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:32):**  is don't over reassure, give people the stick, not the carrot. What we know from social science  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:36):**  research is people are much more motivated by immediate loss and the threat of loss than  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:43):**  potential future gains. So, you know, I think that goes against political instincts, which  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:47):**  are always to to minimise threats, say the economy is going to be fine, be cheerleaders.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:53):**  In this case, you need to err on the side of that threat and the danger to people. And  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:10:59):**  once you start taking your foot off up the gas on that issue, you're going to see you're  
**[0:11:04-0:11:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:04):**  going to have people starting to question it more.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:06):**  Oystein, you were wanting to come in.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:08):**  Yeah, I was going to say, I think all the examples we've talked about, you know, both  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:12):**  the masks, the schools, the social distancing and thinking about it sort of personally,  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:18):**  too, going through it, you know, remembering the week when there was a bunch of mixed messages  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:23):**  around schools and then turning into a school closure on a Sunday night. For me, the big,  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:29):**  you know, it's very simple, but the big change in all of that is that the communication became  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:33):**  effective when when essentially you moved away from kind of individual choice to this  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:38):**  is what we need you to do. So I guess I guess that echoes some of the some of the findings  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:42):**  that Jason alluded to earlier around that, you know, being very clear about the single  
**[0:11:47-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:47):**  outcome you want from a particular message. I remember just that resonated with with me  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:52):**  as well, just knowing that this is what you know, this is what you're being told to do.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:11:56):**  All right. That's, you know, let's hunk it down and do it. It was, you know, the worst  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:00):**  period is that is that period where, you know, there's just a lot of lot of worry or a lot  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:05):**  of mixed messages. And you're talking about some might want to wear masks or some might  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:09):**  not want to, might not want to wear masks, you know, and you leave the audience to sort  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:14):**  of make up their own mind about the right action. You know, maybe it's, you know, it's  
**[0:12:18-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:18):**  an obvious point, but then it is less, you know, less effective.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:21):**  I wonder, you know, we've sort of talked through various different elements of communication,  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:26):**  which are important here. And, you know, and specifically, you've talked about Jason targeting  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:31):**  the single message outcome. This is what you need to do over and over again until people  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:36):**  do it, providing that anticipation of something that's going to happen in the future, not  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:41):**  over reassuring and sharing dilemmas. And I wonder, you know, sort of moving on from  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:47):**  there slightly, if each of you are able to reflect on, you know, this is a big change  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:52):**  in our lives. We have had our freedoms taken away by the government. You know, you know,  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:12:57):**  six months ago, if somebody said this was going to happen, you know, my instinct would  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:00):**  have been to rebel against that. You know, the idea that I have to stay at home, that  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:05):**  I can't go out and shop or meet friends. I mean, ridiculous in a modern society setting.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:11):**  And I think for me, it was an emotional response. And I spoke to somebody the other day and  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:15):**  for them, it was analytical. If everybody got it at the same time, the NHS would be  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:19):**  overwhelmed. Therefore, we stayed home to protect the NHS. For me, it was much more  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:23):**  emotional. You know, at some point, I could suddenly see my parents in particular with  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:28):**  coronavirus and I feared for their health. And so my emotional response was, well, if  
**[0:13:33-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:33):**  I expect other people to make sure that they socially distance from my parents, I need  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:38):**  to do that myself for people who live around me. And then, you know, the final element  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:42):**  of it was the fear of being seen to get it wrong. Uncertainty about what we were allowed  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:48):**  to do, a fear of authority. So that's it for me. And I wonder what it was for you guys.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:53):**  Interesting. I mean, I think for me, it's sort of definitely like you're saying, I think  
**[0:13:59-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:13:59):**  the sort of precautionary principle played in for me is sort of you hear the message,  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:06):**  you're being told that there is something you can do to sort of get out of the way,  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:10):**  protect the health care system and, you know, flatten the curve, so to speak. And I think  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:16):**  it just, you know, I think it was that combination of, yeah, we have the ability and opportunity  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:21):**  to get out of what was becoming the epicenter. And I think that idea of just, you know, I'd  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:26):**  rather be rather be safe than sorry and act on that precautionary principle sort of echoed  
**[0:14:32-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:32):**  echoed with me. But like, you know, like you were saying, I was definitely in the camp  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:35):**  that argued that, you know, if they when we started seeing the measures they implemented  
**[0:14:41-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:41):**  in China, I was definitely one of the people saying, you know, if they try to do this in  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:45):**  New York or in Chicago, whatever, there's going to be, you know, there's going to be  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:48):**  riots, but there weren't, you know, I think people just sort of gradually, you know, understood  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:53):**  the size of the threat and the sort of the specialness of the situation. And then when  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:14:59):**  you heard a uniform and clear message, people followed.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:04):**  Jason.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:05):**  Yeah, it's interesting that break between emotional and analytical, because I'm sure  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:08):**  we all go through that a bit. For me, I definitely have family members that are first responders  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:14):**  and nurses and my sister is a mail carrier. And I've worked with the nurses union here,  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:19):**  which is a very impressive union. And, you know, we all quite rightly revered the nurses.  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:25):**  And I think hearing them say this is what I need was powerful, probably a bit of a side  
**[0:15:29-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:29):**  note to this conversation. But across all industries, we're seeing the importance of  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:33):**  unions speaking up for their members and how that can have an impact on times like this.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:38):**  Another thing that really impacted me and I you know, this is something we know from  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:42):**  other communication research is when the challenge got bigger, it gives you permission to make  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:46):**  more drastic life changes. And so when they're telling you, you know what, don't touch your  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:50):**  face, that doesn't do anything that doesn't really help. That's like telling someone to  
**[0:15:54-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:15:54):**  sign a petition with their email address is also weirdly harder than maybe social distancing.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:03):**  But it doesn't match the scale right when they know this is life and death, try to wash  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:07):**  your hands a bit more and don't touch your face compared to this is life and death and  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:11):**  you all need to stay home and not go to work and our whole economy needs to be flipped  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:16):**  on its head. So actually giving people a bigger challenge, I think we'll find they're more  
**[0:16:21-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:21):**  likely to rise to that and it'll communicate the severity much more.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:25):**  It's much more like a movie, isn't it? You kind of, you get to that moment, you know,  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:29):**  in that kind of UFO invasion movie where Jeff Goldblum stands up and you know, he's the  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:33):**  scientist, he's the person that we trust. And he says, look, you guys, you just got  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:37):**  to stay home. And you know, that's the point at which you know, the shit's going to hit  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:41):**  the fan. And and as you say, that's, that's quite different from, from just saying, try  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:46):**  not to pick your nose because because that's going to kill you. And I'm sort of I'm aware  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:52):**  as we sort of talk about those, you know, I'm remembering some of the some of these  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:56):**  things. You know, when we go out for a walk, we live in the countryside, we're not in the  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:16:59):**  city, I think it'd be very, very different if we were living in the city. But you know,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:03):**  when we were first walking through a kissing gate, I'd be telling the kids off saying,  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:08):**  look, you just you can't touch the kissing gates, you know, don't don't do it. I'm here.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:12):**  I've got my stick. I'm using that. And and I think everybody was like that for the first  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:17):**  week or two. And then we kind of got bored. And then I realised today, you know, I've,  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:20):**  I've not been doing that for really quite a long time. And so, you know, there is this  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:25):**  kind of, you kind of forget time passes and, and things start to normalise. And unless  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:31):**  people are directly threatened immediately next to you, these messages just begin to  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:35):**  wash over a little bit.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:37):**  Well, I guess the big risk there is, is when some of the measures are having the intended  
**[0:17:43-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:43):**  effect, isn't it? So, you know, you're starting to see that around around this country, where  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:48):**  in in states where perhaps they enacted stay at home orders fairly soon, and numbers have  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:17:54):**  been kept very low, then you get the argument of like, what are we doing all this for type  
**[0:18:00-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:00):**  thing, which then, you know, you're sort of becoming a you're becoming victim of your  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:04):**  own success in in some ways. And I think, as you alluded to earlier, Finlow, I think  
**[0:18:09-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:09):**  that will require a kind of next next stage of effective communication and effective and  
**[0:18:14-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:14):**  effective measures to sort of shore up shore up that piece.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:17):**  Yeah, I mean, that the sign we've seen, you know, we've seen this in Singapore, we've  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:21):**  seen it in places where they've relaxed, I fear we're going to see it a lot more is that  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:25):**  Finlow, what you were describing is very common and you might kind of beat yourself up for  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:30):**  I was I was much more conscientious before than I am right now. But I think what you're  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:35):**  missing is that because the measures are so drastic, you're still following a whole bunch  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:39):**  of drastic measures. I might be touching my face, but I'm crossing to the other side of  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:44):**  the street just out of habit now when someone else is walking down. Yeah, that's true. There's  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:49):**  a element in these health crises where you're never gonna it's never gonna be 100%. Right.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:18:54):**  But all you can do is put the odds in your favor. And I guess that effectively communicated  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:00):**  the hierarchy of those actions. So as long as you stick to the big to the big essential  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:05):**  ones. Yeah, yeah, the big ones will will have the most impact and some of the smaller ones,  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:10):**  you know, will be mitigated by the fact that everyone is taking these huge steps, you know,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:15):**  like just not going to work, not being on crowded subways, those types of things. But  
**[0:19:19-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:19):**  once that message starts relaxing, it's Yeah, it's gonna be a pretty, pretty major second  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:26):**  wave. And I think that's going to be the communication challenge when those those next waves come  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:31):**  and people are over this, you know, one of the things in misinformation that gets talked  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:35):**  about a lot is the difference between qualitative and quantitative information. And a quantitative  
**[0:19:40-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:40):**  information is much easier for people to misuse, to confuse, and that there needs to be qualitative  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:48):**  voices out there saying that may seem like they're coming down, but they're they're actually  
**[0:19:51-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:51):**  just coming to the level that we're at quantitative is the numbers, right? It's, it's the numbers  
**[0:19:57-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:19:57):**  of deaths, it's the graphs and charts that we're we're looking at. And qualitative is  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:03):**  the context behind that. What does that mean? And one of the, you know, depending how you  
**[0:20:08-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:08):**  look at it, one of either the benefits or the dangers of the internet age is that we  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:13):**  all have a lot more immediate access to quantitative information. You know, some of these drug  
**[0:20:18-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:18):**  trials were seeing information about them far earlier than we would ever see them years  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:22):**  earlier than we would see them in normal circumstances. And all of a sudden you have people trying  
**[0:20:27-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:27):**  to make their own home remedies and getting sick and dying from them. That's the quantitative  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:32):**  home remedies from the president. I'm interested on social media at the moment. I mean, the  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:37):**  main messages that I tend to see on social media where people starting to question whether  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:41):**  the government has been effective or not. And the other is argument about graphs, argument  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:46):**  about the data that's coming out. And I, I don't reckon that many people really understand  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:52):**  the data that's coming through and that's got a cause for problems.  
**[0:20:55-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:55):**  It is. And I, it's, you know, it makes me think of the other major threats to humanity  
**[0:20:59-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:20:59):**  right now. This virus and climate change, and both of them suffer from kind of being  
**[0:21:05-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:05):**  negative action. And what I mean by that is if you succeed, nothing will change, right?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:10):**  If you succeed, you won't, you won't see the worst case scenario. It's very difficult to  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:14):**  communicate success because success looks like we overreacted to this.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:18):**  Interesting. And you've, you've, you've, you've delivered the segue beautifully for me. You  
**[0:21:23-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:23):**  know, cause you know, we've, we've talked about COVID and we talked about the kind of  
**[0:21:27-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:27):**  communication that's the most successful, you know, which again, it's targeting that  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:30):**  single message outcome, the anticipatory guidance, don't over reassure, share dilemmas, et cetera.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:37):**  And so the question is, well, what can we learn from what governments have done well  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:42):**  and what they've done badly, how we have responded as a society and how can we, how can we find  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:48):**  parallels? Are there parallels with these, you know, these big public health crises that  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:53):**  we know are coming and yet we still don't seem to be doing an awful lot about, and obviously  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:21:59):**  climate change is one, biodiversity loss is another. To me, COVID is different. It is  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:04):**  an immediate threat and these interventionist responses around freedom and expenditure are  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:12):**  temporary. Whereas trying to solve climate change, it isn't about a temporary change.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:17):**  Frankly, if you need to remove people's freedoms and create a massive economic depression in  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:24):**  order to solve climate change, I don't think many people are going to volunteer and say,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:27):**  yeah, let's do that.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:28):**  Yeah, I certainly don't disagree with that. I do feel that this, it's not as much an apples  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:35):**  to oranges comparison as it's that this pandemic is a hyper focus. It's a shortened timeline.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:41):**  You know, if we do look at the stages, we have a period where there was denialism. We  
**[0:22:46-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:46):**  have the social media posts I see from the doubters are also the same people who are  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:50):**  climate change doubters actually on my feed. They question the numbers. They say, oh, hospitals  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:22:55):**  are just labeling everyone as COVID-19 when that's not really what's happening. They say  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:00):**  influenza is worse. So I think we're actually seeing a lot of the same issues just in a  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:05):**  very focused, heightened timeframe. So I do think we, there are things that we can learn  
**[0:23:11-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:11):**  from it. You know, one thing that we have seen maybe to counter what you were saying  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:16):**  of kind of huge changes, people will take huge change if they feel the threat is real.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:20):**  Now convincing them the threat is real has of course been one of the most difficult challenges.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:25):**  But the other piece of this has been leadership has not been there right across the climate  
**[0:23:29-0:23:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:29):**  issue. And I think an idea that it's just going to be a grassroots groundswell that  
**[0:23:34-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:34):**  will fix this and save us from this ecological catastrophe is wrong. It's going to take government  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:40):**  leadership. And what we know now is people will respond to government leadership.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:44):**  I think it's hard to communicate. And I think that it's dangerous if we start confusing  
**[0:23:50-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:50):**  the sort of, you know, the actions that we're being asked to do around the corona crisis  
**[0:23:55-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:23:55):**  with what actions we would want society to take around climate. That can take us down  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:02):**  the wrong path. I think, you know, if we zoom out a little bit, to me, what the corona crisis  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:08):**  shows is that when government understands that it's a clear and present danger, it is  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:14):**  still the most effective force, if you like, to create change and that it's sort of rather  
**[0:24:20-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:20):**  than I feel like in climate discussions, in sustainability discussions more broadly, we  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:27):**  put, you know, put all the effort on the consumer, if you like, or the citizens' choice, and  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:34):**  that it's all about influencing, gently nudging and influencing behaviour change. But to me,  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:40):**  what stands out with the last few weeks is its regulation and its orders that is coming  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:47):**  with a, you know, unison argument behind it is, you know, changes things much quicker  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:53):**  and much more drastically than a nudge ever will. And then obviously, we need to try and  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:24:58):**  figure out how do we not make those orders all be negative and sort of negatively influence  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:05):**  everyone's day to day living. And how do we make them also about, you know, really kind  
**[0:25:10-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:10):**  of powering up the green, you know, the green shift, if you like, and putting our money  
**[0:25:14-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:14):**  behind structural, you know, structural changes and using the kind of power of government  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:20):**  to steer society in a different direction.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:22):**  interventionism seems to be a lesson that's coming out of this. But surely that's not  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:27):**  a lesson that's going to that's going to hold going forward. I mean, over the last 30 years,  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:31):**  there's been this this huge schism between the liberal left who have been proposing interventionist  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:37):**  policies to solve climate change. A lot of people on the right denying that climate change  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:41):**  exists because the solutions are so unpalatable. And, and only recently if we started having  
**[0:25:46-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:46):**  a, you know, really intelligent and grown up debate about how we balance out that need  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:50):**  for regulation and a bit of intervention with, you know, market innovation and competition.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:25:56):**  And so if the lesson coming out of COVID is the intervention is the way to go, you know,  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:00):**  we've got some challenges with climate change, you know, still, even though we've got some  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:04):**  governments, you know, the right on the right in the UK in the US that have intervened in  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:09):**  this instance, it is because they believe it's a temporary intervention. It's not because  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:13):**  they suddenly had some political epiphany and change their mind about, you know, the  
**[0:26:17-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:17):**  way the world works.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:18):**  Yes, I agree. I guess the the premise, in this case, intervention, this seem to have  
**[0:26:25-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:25):**  worked because the key actors all agree on the clear and present danger. And I guess  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:31):**  the beginning of our conversation was how do we how did we get to a situation where  
**[0:26:36-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:36):**  there was so much agreement on the danger that the main focus of communication and debate  
**[0:26:43-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:43):**  have been around how do we best mitigate and prevent this. And if you get to that point,  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:49):**  then we know the clear orders and regulatory guidance, if you like from from governments  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:26:54):**  is is extremely is extremely effective. Obviously, when it comes to climate, we still we're still  
**[0:27:00-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:00):**  faced with that first challenge, which is, you know, how do we make sure that the politicians  
**[0:27:06-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:06):**  and an industry and the key actors agree on the agree on the on the danger so that we  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:12):**  can move to that more constructive part of the conversation and look at how do we how  
**[0:27:16-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:16):**  do we generate the shift that we need.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:18):**  And I'd say that there is a few specifics we can learn from the Coronavirus communication  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:23):**  and that apply to climate and probably some other issues where we're dealing with science  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:28):**  and societal change that needs to happen. And, you know, there's two places I think  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:33):**  they failed on the climate change side, the scientists and the activists. One is having  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:39):**  that single message outcome, having something that they're trying, they're communicating  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:42):**  the science for a purpose. There's been this belief and complete objectivity. And if they  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:47):**  if the IPC just comes out and says, this is just the science, do what you will with it.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:53):**  And also some over reassurance. Their models are are on the conservative side. So I think  
**[0:27:57-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:27:57):**  that's been a mistake in communicating the science. I talked about trust and action at  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:02):**  the beginning underpinning everything is values. And the scientists have values. I don't think  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:07):**  it needs to be an agenda, so to speak, but they have values guiding what they're doing  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:11):**  and being transparent about those actually will drive more trust. And the other piece,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:16):**  as it applies to the activists, is sharing dilemmas. We've talked about these huge changes  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:20):**  that will need to happen, but not in a way that shares the dilemmas behind them. The  
**[0:28:25-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:25):**  hard choices that will have to be made, the sacrifices that will have to be made that  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:29):**  honours those people making those sacrifices. And so I think if we can start having that  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:33):**  conversation about those dilemmas we're going to face as a society and economic choices  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:38):**  we're going to have to make, then it'll prepare people for moving forward with that.  
**[0:28:42-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:42):**  There's an interesting crossover with a couple of things that you were talking about there.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:47):**  There's that whole kind of don't over reassure. And a whole way that the IPCC has approached  
**[0:28:52-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:52):**  this is by, as you say, downplaying the risks, not factoring in the impact of feedbacks like  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:28:59):**  tundra melt and that sort of thing. And then there's that whole sort of element of denialism  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:05):**  and the focusing on numbers. And in the same way, I was talking about social media, people  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:09):**  arguing about the numbers, which graph is most telling. I think that there has been  
**[0:29:14-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:14):**  a huge focus on the number of degrees in a minute. One point five degrees, two degrees  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:21):**  to most people, they're not thinking of it as an average across the planet. They're thinking  
**[0:29:25-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:25):**  of, well, what does two degrees mean for me? It means I get a better summer. And that fixation  
**[0:29:30-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:30):**  on the numbers obfuscates entirely the impacts of what we're talking about. Whereas perhaps  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:36):**  with coronavirus, it would, you know, going back to that conversation we were having earlier  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:40):**  about why we as individuals decided to have our freedoms restricted and that emotional  
**[0:29:46-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:46):**  theme, we can see our family in danger. And if we focus more on the consequences of climate  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:29:55):**  change and less on the number of degrees, maybe that would be a start.  
**[0:30:01-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:01):**  You know, the thing that cuts through the numbers is the human stories. And with COVID,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:08):**  you know, it's these images of these nurses and doctors talking about having to inform  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:13):**  families over FaceTime or a doctor standing outside his house waving at his young child,  
**[0:30:18-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:18):**  young, healthy people having to lose a leg because of complications of COVID-19 and even  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:24):**  dying because of it when young people felt they were invincible. In climate, we have  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:30):**  the stories already. It's already impacting people. When farmers start saying, here's  
**[0:30:34-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:34):**  what I'm seeing, the impact on my crops, here's how my life and livelihood has changed because  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:38):**  of climate change, that cuts through all the noise about how many degrees and parts per  
**[0:30:43-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:43):**  million and the numbers. And I guess what we've been talking about  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:47):**  is that those stories and the people who, you know, generating those stories, I guess  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:52):**  it needs to be coupled with a really clear definition of what we would want people to  
**[0:30:57-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:30:57):**  do with that information. So that would be one of the other key lessons that I take from  
**[0:31:03-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:03):**  Corona is that there is a responsibility that falls on scientists to be clear about what  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:10):**  kind of change they want their findings to have. And maybe there's even a sort of opportunity  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:15):**  to take, you know, in finance, you've got this sort of subsection of people who call  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:19):**  themselves impact investors who are unapologetically looking to spend their money in a way that  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:25):**  will have a clearly defined societal or environmental impact over and beyond the sort of financial  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:32):**  return. And I think getting some of that kind of thinking and language also into the scientific  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:38):**  community where sort of impactful communication or measuring the impact the findings are having  
**[0:31:44-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:44):**  on society or however you want to define it, that that becomes part of how scientists are  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:51):**  rated, how their careers develop, that we need to maybe look at how universities rate  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:31:57):**  their researchers, that there are things that are perhaps more important than just being  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:01):**  cited by other academics and other academic journals.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:05):**  It seems to me that the IPCC in itself is a problem in this in terms of communicating  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:12):**  the urgency of climate change, because it's a political institution informed by science.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:17):**  And so when we get these, you know, these big assessments that come out, it's a piece  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:22):**  of diplomacy. It's the lowest common denominator. It's what everybody's been able to agree to  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:28):**  from the most denialist states that, you know, that are most oil dependent in the world,  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:33):**  you know, those states that are most bought into the the urgent need to deal with this.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:39):**  And so by its very nature, those messages are going to be, you know, very conservative.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:44):**  And then there's the element where, you know, governments want to be seen to be in control.  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:49):**  But actually, I think what we're hearing is that governments need to be a bit more honest  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:54):**  about the threats that are coming, be a bit more united in talking about that, and then  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:32:59):**  start to be a bit more honest about that conversation, the trade offs that society perhaps needs  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:04):**  to consider making. And I think that's starting to happen in the UK now that we've moved on  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:09):**  from a conversation about whether climate change exists or not. And we're now in that  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:13):**  place where we're starting to have a conversation about how quickly, how successful, which party  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:18):**  is going to drive emissions down fastest.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:20):**  Yeah, I think that's a strong summation of, you know, where we've been, where we are now  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:27):**  and where we need to go. And I think the one other piece that we can learn from this current  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:32):**  crisis is that need to challenge people and be clear about what you're asking them to  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:36):**  do. And I think that's really been missing from climate change. There's been a sense  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:40):**  that there's moral authority and just raising the alarm or putting out the science without  
**[0:33:46-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:46):**  asking anything of people. And we have to admit we've moved beyond that point. We need  
**[0:33:51-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:51):**  to start sharing those dilemmas and then asking people to be part of taking tough, what may  
**[0:33:56-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:56):**  be tough actions and challenging to be part of that solution.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:33:59):**  Fantastic. I mean, I've kind of, you know, I've been trying to sort of scribble down  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:03):**  some of these, these learnings that we can take as we've been talking and you know, the  
**[0:34:07-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:07):**  one there was that challenging of individuals, you know, why is it, why is there anybody  
**[0:34:13-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:13):**  in the UK who is concerned about climate change that isn't on a renewable energy tariff? That's  
**[0:34:19-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:19):**  something that everybody can do and something that we all should be doing, especially because  
**[0:34:23-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:23):**  the prices are, you know, entirely competitive with, with old fashioned fossil fuel energy.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:30):**  And then there's that whole thing of forgetting the numbers. Just let's stop talking about  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:34):**  degrees, stop talking about parts per million and start focusing on the impacts, the impacts  
**[0:34:41-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:41):**  right now in our society, how it's going to impact on me, on my community, on my country,  
**[0:34:48-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:48):**  on my food security, as well as those impacts around the world. And let's get that single  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:53):**  message outcome as well. Let's talk about fossil fuels. Let's talk about CO2, bringing  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:34:59):**  that down instead of getting focused as we have done recently on whether people should  
**[0:35:04-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:04):**  be vegetarian or whether they shouldn't be vegetarian, focus on the things that matter  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:07):**  and that's stopping using fossil fuels. And then there's, there's that whole piece we've  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:11):**  just touched on now about being honest about the risks and having a debate about how we  
**[0:35:16-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:16):**  as a society, what those trade-offs are and those choices we should make.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:20):**  As I hear you put all them together, there's a word that comes to mind, which is justice.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:25):**  And that in the response there needs to be, there won't always be fairness, but there  
**[0:35:29-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:29):**  needs to be a sense of justice. And that's what we're saying. You know, in this it's,  
**[0:35:34-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:34):**  it's not fair that kids can't go to school. It's not fair that people have to stay home.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:38):**  It's not fair that we can't enjoy the park on what is a beautiful day today here in New  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:43):**  York. But by looking out for those essential workers, we're, you know, we're taking part  
**[0:35:47-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:47):**  in a form of justice. And I think with climate and other major issues, the kind of value  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:53):**  framing for looking at those dilemmas and those tough choices is really about it being  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:58):**  rooted in justice.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:35:59):**  It's interesting you say that because of course there was this whole conversation certainly  
**[0:36:02-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:02):**  here, you know, at the beginning where politicians were saying, look, and the media was saying,  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:07):**  look, coronavirus is the great leveler. Anybody can get coronavirus. It doesn't matter where  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:12):**  you come from in society. But actually that isn't true. The people who are getting coronavirus  
**[0:36:18-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:18):**  the most are those who are, you know, in those key worker jobs, people with big houses and  
**[0:36:22-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:22):**  big gardens aren't suffering from the lockdown to the same extent that people living in,  
**[0:36:27-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:27):**  you know, tower blocks are. The people who are contracting the virus are those who are  
**[0:36:31-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:31):**  going out working in shops on a daily basis, working in the health service, collecting  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:36):**  our BIMs. So it isn't a great leveler. And we, I think you're absolutely right that that  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:41):**  sense of justice has to be at the heart of our response to dealing with climate change  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Mass-mobilisation--coronavirus--climate-change-edjtie#t=0:36:46):**  and biodiversity loss. That's all we've got time for. I'd like to thank my guests, Jason

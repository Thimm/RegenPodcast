### Farm Gate  (Wed, 08 Jan 2020 10:39:33)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, I'm Finnlow Castayne and this is Farmgate. Today I'm investigating the contribution  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:11):**  that ruminant methane makes to global warming. Research by a global team of scientists based  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:16):**  at the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford has established a new way of measuring  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:21):**  the impacts of methane. GWP Star allows us to accurately measure the impact of ruminant  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:27):**  methane for the first time. I'll be talking to Professor Miles Allen and Dr John Lynch  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:32):**  from the University of Oxford. Later in the programme I'll speak to Roland Bonney, a  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:37):**  farmer and co-founder of FAI Farms and Benchmark Holdings. Professor Miles Allen is a coordinating  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:44):**  lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on 1.5 degrees,  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:50):**  having served on the IPCC's third, fourth and fifth assessments. He was also the lead  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:55):**  scientist on the Oxford Martin methane research team. It's important to stress that this  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:01):**  is not particularly new science. In fact, in many ways we're just drawing out the implications  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:06):**  of science that the community has understood for a very long time. Methane behaves in a  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:10):**  fundamentally different way to carbon dioxide. If you dump a tonne of carbon dioxide into  
**[0:01:15-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:15):**  the atmosphere, it causes warming which persists effectively forever, tens of thousands, even  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:21):**  hundreds of thousands of years. To do the same with methane, you would have to increase  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:27):**  your rate of methane emissions, that's tonnes per year of methane emissions, and then hold  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:32):**  them up forever. And that would have the same impact on global temperature as dumping that  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:37):**  single tonne of carbon dioxide would have. So that's a fundamentally different thing,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:42):**  but it does mean you can compare methane and CO2, but what you have to do is compare a  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:48):**  change in the emission rate of methane with a single tonne of CO2, a one-off emission  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:55):**  of CO2.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:56):**  Dr. John Lynch is a postdoctoral research assistant in the Department of Physics at  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:01):**  the University of Oxford. He was also part of the methane research team. I asked him  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:05):**  to explain the different behavioural characteristics of carbon dioxide and methane.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:11):**  We'll start by thinking about carbon dioxide because this is the most important greenhouse  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:16):**  gas that we emit the most of, and it's by quite a long way the bigger contributor to  
**[0:02:22-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:22):**  global warming, and it's also the reference gas that we compare the other emissions to.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:27):**  So for carbon dioxide, let's say we emit a one-off emission of carbon dioxide today.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:34):**  There are then various removal processes that will, some of it will get absorbed into the  
**[0:02:39-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:39):**  ocean, some of it will be fixed by plants and trees, but a significant fraction of that  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:44):**  carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere and continue exerting a global warming effect.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:50):**  Even after centuries to millennia, we'll still have quite a big chunk of the carbon  
**[0:02:54-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:54):**  dioxide still there.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:55):**  Did you say centuries and millennia?  
**[0:02:57-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:57):**  Yes, so it will gradually keep declining, the atmospheric increase of carbon dioxide  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:04):**  after our emission, but the rate at which it's removed will get increasingly slow,  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:09):**  and even after millennia, unless we actively remove it, we still expect a significantly  
**[0:03:13-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:13):**  greater carbon dioxide concentration because of our human activities.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:18):**  So that's CO2.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:19):**  How is methane different to that?  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:21):**  Yeah, so methane is very different because even though, if you imagine emitting one molecule  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:27):**  of methane to one molecule of CO2, that molecule of methane actually has quite a strong warming  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:33):**  impact, quite a lot stronger than the CO2.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:36):**  But unlike CO2, the methane is going to break down naturally quite quickly.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:40):**  So after a few decades, if we emit methane today, most of that's going to have been  
**[0:03:45-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:45):**  lost from the atmosphere, whereas for CO2, as we've just discussed, it's going to  
**[0:03:49-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:49):**  stay there and carry on accumulating for as long as we keep on the emissions.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:53):**  So if we were thinking about this with a playground metaphor, methane acts like a sudden punch  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:00):**  in the face, whereas carbon dioxide behaves a bit more like that teacher that just keeps  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:06):**  on at you time after time after time, breaking down your confidence until you're a shrivelling  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:10):**  wreck at the end of your school life.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:13):**  That could be one way to think of it, yes.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:15):**  A metaphor that my boss is quite keen on, actually, is he would describe methane as  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:20):**  like getting drunk.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:22):**  So you go, you have a few too many beers, and then the next morning, you know, you don't  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:27):**  feel great because of it, but after the next couple of days, it's going to wear off,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:31):**  and you won't be that much worse for wear for it, whereas carbon dioxide is a bit like  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:36):**  lead poisoning, where if you get lead poisoning, you're going to be stuck with the damage.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:42):**  And if you keep on having that poisoning, it's just going to get worse and worse and  
**[0:04:46-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:46):**  worse.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:47):**  OK, so between science and metaphor, we've got a pretty clear idea of the way in which  
**[0:04:51-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:51):**  methane behaves differently from carbon dioxide.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:54):**  Next I asked John to apply that information practically in a farm setting, in particular,  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:59):**  to describe the life cycle of methane, where it comes from and where it goes to, in a grass-based  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:05):**  ruminant system.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:06):**  Yeah, so let's imagine we are setting up a new farm, we've got grass growing there  
**[0:05:13-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:13):**  that the animals eat.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:15):**  So this grass is growing by pulling carbon out of the atmosphere, so atmospheric carbon  
**[0:05:20-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:20):**  dioxide is fixed into the grass biomass, then your ruminants, or your cow or your sheep  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:27):**  comes along and eats that grass, and they eat the carbon contained in the plant biomass.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:33):**  Now as a byproduct of the ruminant digestive process, so a process called enteric fermentation,  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:39):**  the bacteria in their gut that are breaking down that plant biomass, some of that carbon  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:44):**  contained in it is converted to methane, and then they belch that out as a byproduct of  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:50):**  their normal ruminant digestion.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:52):**  The rest of the carbon will go into the animal, which we may then eat, and then through either  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:58):**  the animal's respiration or our respiration, the rest of it will be returned as carbon  
**[0:06:02-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:02):**  dioxide.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:03):**  But that methane component, so the animal eats the grass, the carbon in that, some of  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:08):**  that's converted to methane, the animal breathes out the methane, and then that methane over  
**[0:06:12-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:12):**  the next few decades will also break down back to carbon dioxide.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:16):**  So we have a carbon cycle going on here over a few decades.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:21):**  Now having this step as methane in the middle does mean that it has an extra climate effect  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:26):**  that it wouldn't if it was just CO2 and respiration cycling around, but it's very distinct from  
**[0:06:32-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:32):**  what's happening with fossil fuels.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:34):**  So with fossil fuels, we have the carbon trapped up in oil or gas, been buried underground  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:40):**  for millions of years, and then when we burn those fossil fuels, the CO2 that's released,  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:45):**  that's an additional source of carbon that is going to affect the carbon cycle, essentially  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:50):**  indefinitely unless we manage to actively remove it again.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:54):**  So it's a very different kind of impact on the climate between these two types of emissions.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:59):**  Dr John Lynch.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:01):**  Let's go back to Professor Miles Allen.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:04):**  The rumour that's heard in Britain and Europe did cause global warming when it was built  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:09):**  up, whenever it was built up, probably centuries ago in many cases.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:14):**  But if that herd is now stable or slightly declining, then it's no longer adding to  
**[0:07:20-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:20):**  the warming it's already caused.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:22):**  It is of course holding temperatures up.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:25):**  So it's not, you know, just because we're gently reducing our methane emissions, it  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:33):**  doesn't mean that those methane emissions are right now causing significant global cooling,  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:38):**  but they're probably not contributing to any further global warming either.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:43):**  And so that's the very important difference between methane and CO2.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:47):**  If you were doing the same with CO2 and gently reducing your carbon dioxide emissions, you  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:54):**  would still be contributing to global warming.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:56):**  And you'd be still contributing global warming all the time until you got your carbon dioxide  
**[0:08:01-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:01):**  emissions all the way down to zero, because carbon dioxide accumulates in the climate  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:04):**  system as long as you've got any positive, net positive emissions of carbon dioxide associated  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:09):**  with whatever it is you're doing, you're still causing global warming.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:13):**  So the temperature increase from ruminant methane is historic, and providing that a  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:17):**  herd is stable or slightly declining, there will be no additional increase in global temperatures.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:23):**  There was an initial pulse of warming when the herd was first established, perhaps 50  
**[0:08:27-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:27):**  or 100 years ago.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:29):**  But even while the herd's methane emissions continue, there will be no additional temperature  
**[0:08:34-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:34):**  increase arising from that herd.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:37):**  I asked Dr. John Lynch if he could explain the science in just a little bit more detail.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:43):**  So if we think now, what does this mean in terms of the dynamics of how different emissions  
**[0:08:48-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:48):**  relate to temperature change?  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:49):**  It means that for methane, if we had kind of long term emissions at the same rate, eventually,  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:55):**  we would have stable emissions that are just going to be topping up the atmosphere to the  
**[0:09:00-0:09:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:00):**  same level, because they're essentially replacing past emissions at the same rate that they're  
**[0:09:04-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:04):**  naturally broken down.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:06):**  So if we manage to keep emissions of methane at the same rate for more than a few decades,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:11):**  we're going to have fairly stable temperatures.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:14):**  So there will be some global warming still occurring because there are long term response  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:18):**  elements of the climate.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:20):**  But ultimately, we're not going to have indefinitely increasing temperatures.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:23):**  Whereas for carbon dioxide, even if we stabilise CO2 emissions at the same rate, because it's  
**[0:09:28-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:28):**  accumulating, that would mean ever increasing temperatures.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:31):**  So that's the that's the first figure to imagine you have a flat line of emissions for both  
**[0:09:35-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:35):**  of the gases.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:37):**  That means relatively flat temperatures for methane, but increasing temperatures from  
**[0:09:41-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:41):**  carbon dioxide.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:42):**  And the even more striking comparison is if we then think about well, what if we managed  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:47):**  to reduce emissions?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:49):**  So again, just coming back down to these same fairly straightforward dynamics that CO2 is  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:54):**  cumulative and methane isn't.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:56):**  If we decrease CO2 emissions until we finally reach zero, we're only slowing the rate at  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:02):**  which we add extra CO2 to the atmosphere, and then only when we finally stop do we kind  
**[0:10:07-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:07):**  of cap out at a relatively fixed amount of warming for the next few centuries.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:11):**  But for methane, if we managed to reduce emissions below their current level, then we're kind  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:16):**  of not topping up emissions to the same amount that we are at the moment.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:20):**  So we'd actually be able to reverse the amount of methane in the atmosphere and reverse some  
**[0:10:25-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:25):**  of the warming that it causes.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:26):**  So if we have declining methane emissions for either gas for CO2, that means extra temperature  
**[0:10:32-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:32):**  increase slows down until it stabilises.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:35):**  Whereas for methane, it means you're able to reverse some of the past temperature changes.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:39):**  And if we're trying to deliver stability, if we're trying to make sure that there is  
**[0:10:44-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:44):**  no additional temperature increase from methane as we go forward, am I right in thinking that  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:50):**  emissions need to drop by about 0.3% year on year on year?  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:55):**  Yeah, that's right.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:56):**  So even if we even though if we have stable methane emissions, the amount of methane in  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:02):**  the atmosphere might not increase, there is still a slow adjustment of the climate to  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:07):**  those concentrations.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:09):**  So we can't just have stable methane for no warming, we need to have a slow gradual decline,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:15):**  or a slight offset from removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:19):**  And that's how we would be able to have stable temperatures.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:22):**  Whereas for carbon dioxide, the only way to have stable temperatures is just to stop emitting  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:26):**  the gas.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:27):**  And so if we were to encapsulate that more detailed description that you've given there,  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:34):**  would it be accurate to say that the emissions can continue from cattle, but providing there  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:41):**  is that very slight reduction year on year, while the emissions continue, the temperature  
**[0:11:46-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:46):**  does not continue to increase?  
**[0:11:48-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:48):**  Yeah, so the way I think about this is that we have our climate objectives to try and  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:54):**  stop warming before one and a half or two degrees.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:58):**  So the assumption there is that it's based around stabilising temperature without exceeding  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:03):**  these thresholds.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:04):**  So to stabilise temperature, you have to cut out co2 emissions completely or completely  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:09):**  offset any emissions you do have going on.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:11):**  And that's a physical requirement.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:13):**  There's no getting around it.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:15):**  But for methane, it is possible to have some ongoing emissions without ever increasing  
**[0:12:21-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:21):**  temperatures.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:22):**  There's Dr. John Lynch there explaining the underlying science.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:26):**  Next I asked him about the metric GWP star, which updates the standard metric used by  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:31):**  governments to analyse global warming potential, and which is embedded in global treaties.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:36):**  The GWP star metric allows us for the first time to accurately account for the global  
**[0:12:41-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:41):**  warming impact of methane.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:44):**  So what what GWP star can capture when you when you apply it to the two different gases  
**[0:12:49-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:49):**  is essentially that if you introduce a new source of methane emissions, that has a very  
**[0:12:54-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:54):**  different impact to if you simply sustain a previously long term ongoing methane emission.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:01):**  So if you add your new methane source over the first 20 years, that has a very big climate  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:07):**  impact.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:08):**  And you'd actually underestimate that impact from using the conventional global warming  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:12):**  potential.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:13):**  But after the first few decades, you already experienced most of the warming that you're  
**[0:13:16-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:16):**  ever going to from having introduced that new methane.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:19):**  So from that point onwards, GWP star will describe it as a smaller CO2 equivalence compared  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:25):**  to the conventional application of the metric.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:27):**  So that's that's the real fundamental implication of if you're trying to relate how do my emissions  
**[0:13:32-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:32):**  contribute to climate change, you need to have this distinct kind of temporal understanding  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:38):**  to be able to know, well, if I continue or add or remove methane emissions, what's that  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:43):**  going to mean for the climate in 1020 3040 years time, that's what you can use GWP star  
**[0:13:49-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:49):**  to answer.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:50):**  So that's what GWP star does.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:53):**  Next I asked Professor Miles Allen, why the new metric should be adopted by governments  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:58):**  and the global science community.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:01):**  The government measures is emissions based on this rather arbitrary GWP 100 standard.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:06):**  And what we're proposing is if we're aiming to end our contribution to global warming,  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:13):**  as Theresa May put it when they announced the net zero goal, if that's the objective, then  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:18):**  we should really be measuring emissions in terms of their contribution to global warming.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:22):**  That seems like a natural way to to compare things.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:27):**  And what we've done in our research is really just to show how easy it is, if you like,  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:32):**  to compute the impact of different gases on actual global temperatures, rather than this  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:38):**  nominal carbon dioxide equivalent number, which actually doesn't relate directly to  
**[0:14:43-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:43):**  global temperature change at all.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:46):**  So it strikes me that we're interested in emissions really as a proxy for what we're  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:50):**  actually interested in, which is the warming from those emissions.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:53):**  So it, you know, it makes complete sense to to measure things in that way.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:58):**  What's been the response of government and the global science community when you've presented  
**[0:15:02-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:02):**  this science?  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:03):**  Well, as I said at the outset, the science here is not particularly controversial at  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:07):**  all.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:08):**  It's the implications that some people find controversial, because we've got a policy  
**[0:15:12-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:12):**  community that's got a established, they built up practices and so on based on this notion  
**[0:15:21-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:21):**  of carbon dioxide equivalents.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:23):**  And people are nervous about the implications of any change to that.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:28):**  I don't think, however, keeping on with a flawed accounting system just because it's  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:34):**  the one you're using is sustainable in the long term.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:38):**  So I think it's important we get these ideas out there.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:41):**  And also really important to emphasize to them that we are using the same data that's  
**[0:15:46-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:46):**  already been reported.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:47):**  We're just suggesting a different way of processing it, which actually reflects impact  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:53):**  on global temperature much better.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:55):**  So it's not a particularly radical change to what people are having to do anyway.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:59):**  Professor Miles Allen, at this point, we have a working understanding of the science and  
**[0:16:04-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:04):**  of the updated global warming potential metric GWP star.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:09):**  But what does this mean in practical terms?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:11):**  How important is the science and what difference will it actually make?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:15):**  Roland Bonney is a co-founder of FAI Farms and Benchmark Holdings.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:20):**  And in 2018, when the methane research was first published, he immediately recognized  
**[0:16:24-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:24):**  its importance.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:26):**  Over the last 18 months, FAI Farms and my organization Farmwell have worked with the  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:31):**  Oxford Martin team to bring this science to the attention of farmers' organizations and  
**[0:16:36-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:36):**  to governments.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:37):**  The research is important because it fixes an anomaly in the way in which we've accounted  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:42):**  for the warming impact of methane.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:44):**  And it allows farmers to accurately assess their farm's warming contributions and therefore  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:51):**  accurately identify what they can do to mitigate that contribution.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:56):**  So over the last couple of years or so, the media has been full of how methane is a real  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:02):**  problem.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:03):**  That's where all of the attention should lie.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:05):**  And therefore, cattle and sheep are a real problem.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:08):**  Well, everything that has emissions obviously is making a contribution one way or another  
**[0:17:15-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:15):**  to climate warming.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:17):**  But the situation around cattle and sheep or around ruminants has been exaggerated because  
**[0:17:23-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:23):**  the metric is a very poor metric.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:25):**  The new metric is accurate and approximately halves the impact of the methane, halves the  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:32):**  number that reflects the warming impact of the methane.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:35):**  And in reality, what it means is that if we stabilize methane and reduce them or mitigate  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:43):**  in other ways, but reduce them at about 0.3% per animal, 10% over 30 years, which could  
**[0:17:49-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:49):**  be done with a small reduction in livestock or can be done through mitigating in other  
**[0:17:52-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:52):**  ways, essentially those animals, those ruminants are not contributing in terms of their methane  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:59):**  output to increased heating.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:01):**  And when you say mitigating in other ways, I imagine that you're talking about things  
**[0:18:06-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:06):**  like tree planting.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:07):**  So how does that work?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:09):**  Are we are we talking about sort of plantations next to a farm in order to mitigate that or  
**[0:18:15-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:15):**  is it in some way integrated like agroforestry?  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:18):**  Well, I think this is another problem at the moment is a lot of the modeling that's been  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:23):**  done that's fueling some of the headline discussions with regard to land use, for example, planting  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:30):**  the uplands just takes into account the benefits of having tree and the carbon that's soaked  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:35):**  up by those trees over the next 60 years.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:37):**  It doesn't take into account the carbon that's already there, much of which would be lost  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:42):**  because if you plant grasslands with trees, as the tree grows, the grassland, when we  
**[0:18:47-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:47):**  get towards canopy cover, the grassland dies off.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:50):**  And therefore, the numbers have been overblown in terms of that land use change in terms  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:55):**  of the benefits.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:56):**  There's also there's been very little discussion as to the stability of that biological carbon  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:01):**  in the terms of fast tracks of forests, which at 15 years of age are going to be highly  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:07):**  prone to fires.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:08):**  I'm not suggesting quite the scale that we're seeing in Australia, but there will be fires  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:13):**  that there are now and the more woodland and the more dead grass we have, the more likely  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:18):**  we are to have fires.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:19):**  And we need to recognize, we need to manage our land if we want to seriously lock up carbon  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:24):**  and that requires intervention, it requires thought.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:28):**  And the best way probably to do this on a national scale is through the national patchwork,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:35):**  the patchwork of sort of quilt like nature of our British landscape, where we have trees  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:40):**  across our landscape, we have fire breaks in the form of livestock, graze fields, we  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:46):**  have crops and we have mixed rotations.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:50):**  I think that's probably the best solution.  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:53):**  So at the moment, sort of central to the government's policy seems to be this idea of a sparing off.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:59):**  They're talking about taking 20% of land out of production for tree planting.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:04):**  Other people are wanting land taken out for rewilding.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:07):**  And then it's almost as though, you know, the food that's being produced is going to  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:12):**  be produced in even in ever smaller pockets of land and presumably more intensively.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:17):**  I think, I think the again, the arguments have been polarized into sharing and sparing.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:23):**  And I think they're unhelpful polar opposites or appear to be that way.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:29):**  I think there are areas of the country that will and are being, you know, where agriculture  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:34):**  is withdrawing from those areas.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:37):**  I think so there is an opportunity for areas to be, you know, wilded as some would call  
**[0:20:42-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:42):**  it and certainly opportunities for tree planting and therefore establishing larger scale woodlands.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:50):**  But there's a far greater opportunity to integrate back into the biology of nature, the whole  
**[0:20:57-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:57):**  of our food system at a national level.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:01):**  So if I was to summarize that and I know that's slightly crass, then you're saying some sparing,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:07):**  a lot of sharing.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:08):**  Yeah, I think some sparing.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:10):**  I think we've already seen, we're seeing some of that.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:12):**  We've seen a lot of it, certainly in parts of Scotland.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:16):**  But, you know, a lot of sharing would be the way forward, because then we can have a rich  
**[0:21:21-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:21):**  patchwork quill of diverse food stuffs grown locally, corridors for wildlife and biodiversity  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:30):**  and the ability for it to move and breathe across the whole of our landscape, not just  
**[0:21:36-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:36):**  in pockets away from people.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:39):**  So I think that that is the better way forward.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:41):**  And I think we will achieve far more going down that route, because I think that will  
**[0:21:45-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:45):**  be supported by the farming community and the landowners.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:49):**  Whereas if we're if we turn to them and just say, we want you to stop and we're only going  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:53):**  to encourage this 30 percent of farmers to carry on, I think we'll you know, we'll be  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:57):**  arguing about that for the next 50 years.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:59):**  I know a lot of farmers phone you up and talk to you.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:02):**  And I wonder if you could tell me how farmers are feeling at the moment about the way that  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:08):**  the way that the media is talking about them and the emissions that are related to farming  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:13):**  and how farmers respond when they hear about this this updated metric.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:18):**  Well, as you can expect, there's a range of responses.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:21):**  I think that the fundamental response is captured in two things that come out strongly.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:27):**  One is shock.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:28):**  They're shocked that the media is turned on them in this way.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:31):**  They don't feel that they're being represented fairly in this debate.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:36):**  And I think, you know, with some reason and the idea that the food chain can be turned  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:40):**  on its head in the way some are suggesting in the sort of time frame that's being suggested.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:44):**  I think for most farmers don't believe that that's possible or likely.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:49):**  I see farmers, they're like a standing army and they're sprung on wire to respond to these  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:54):**  challenges.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:55):**  But we need a constructive partnership between government, consumer and farmer or maybe government  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:01):**  citizen and farmer, because it isn't just about what the consumer wants or doesn't want  
**[0:23:04-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:04):**  to eat.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:05):**  The critical issue here is how we farm and how we use our land to provide us with a diverse  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:09):**  nutritious diet and at the same time stabilise climate and biodiversity.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:15):**  The farmers that are phoning me up and that I'm talking to are passionate about tackling  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:20):**  climate change.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:21):**  They're passionate about addressing diversity.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:25):**  They just want clarity on that partnership with government and consumer or citizen to  
**[0:23:32-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:32):**  allow them to do that.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:33):**  Now, we know we're not going to get complete agreement.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:36):**  People have different views as to what we should do and what we shouldn't do.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:40):**  But we have to remember that these, for millennia, these farms have been farmed by families and  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:46):**  society has been happy to support that.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:49):**  And there's a huge amount of trust in farmers.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:51):**  What we need to do now is create an environment where we can empower them to get on and hit  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:57):**  the targets that have been identified by the NFU 2040 and to be net zero warming impact  
**[0:24:03-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:03):**  is doable, but only if we get on with that partnership with a healthy partnership in  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:09):**  the interim.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:11):**  That was Roland Bonney.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:12):**  So what difference does GWP Star make to the warming impact of individual farms?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:18):**  To find out, we've run the numbers on several farms with the Oxford Martin team.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:23):**  We used the SRUC carbon calculator as the basis for analysing greenhouse gas emissions  
**[0:24:28-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:28):**  and then applied GWP Star to recalculate the warming impact of methane.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:33):**  FAI Farms near Oxford is primarily a cattle and sheep operation.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:37):**  The impact of greenhouse gases is still described in terms of CO2 equivalents and as you might  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:43):**  expect their carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide values remain the same.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:47):**  Their methane emissions value, however, under GWP Star fell by 75%.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:54):**  Factored together, the whole farm climate impact fell by half.  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:58):**  In Northumberland, we visited a sheep farm.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:01):**  Again, the methane emissions value fell by 75%, with the whole farm emissions dropping  
**[0:25:06-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:06):**  by 52%.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:08):**  When we consider these numbers, we can see clearly that the global warming impact of  
**[0:25:13-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:13):**  ruminant methane has been greatly exaggerated.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:16):**  Metrics matter and under the old metric, the inaccurate representation of agricultural  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:21):**  methane has allowed attention to be diverted away from fossil fuels.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:26):**  Professor Miles Allen again.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:28):**  Of course, we should be focusing on fossil fuels because most of the warming caused to  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:32):**  date has been caused by carbon dioxide from fossil fuels.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:35):**  Most of the warming caused in the future under all scenarios is caused by carbon dioxide  
**[0:25:40-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:40):**  from fossil fuels.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:42):**  Methane is an important contributor.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:45):**  It is a very powerful greenhouse gas.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:47):**  It does therefore matter.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:49):**  It may in some cases be easier to reduce methane emissions than carbon dioxide emissions.  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:55):**  Some of our methane emissions at the moment come from the natural gas industry just operating  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:00):**  leaky pipes.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:01):**  That's, in my view, is unforgivable.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:03):**  Just finally, would you say that your research shows that methane can be a get out of jail  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:09):**  free card that we could play now to give us a good strong pulse of cooling if we dramatically  
**[0:26:15-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:15):**  reduce cattle and sheep numbers today?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:17):**  Well, that is what would happen, but it would only happen once.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:21):**  And so if you reduce temperatures temporarily, and it wouldn't be that much, it would be  
**[0:26:27-0:26:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:27):**  at the order of a tenth of a degree at absolute maximum, maybe even less.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:32):**  You know, that's only a few years of warming due to carbon dioxide as CO2 emissions continue.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:39):**  So you know, you level off temperatures very temporarily and then they carry on rising.  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:45):**  The important point to stress therefore is action on methane can help, but at the end  
**[0:26:51-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:51):**  of the day, if we're still piling on warming in degree by degree with fossil fuels, then  
**[0:26:59-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:59):**  actions that affect global temperatures at the level of a tenth of a degree to some extent  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:04):**  do risk becoming a bit of a distraction.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:07):**  And I am quite concerned by how much of the conversation around climate change has been  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:12):**  diverted onto these measures.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:15):**  It's not just methane, it's many other measures that would make a relatively small difference  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:19):**  to the outcome when the big element in the corner is the fact that we are still using  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:25):**  fossil fuels at an ever faster rate.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:28):**  And until we get the fossil fuel CO2 problem under control, which means bringing net fossil  
**[0:27:32-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:32):**  fuel emissions to zero, we're going to carry on warming the climate.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:37):**  Professor Miles Allen, climate change doesn't exist because people farm cattle and sheep.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:44):**  It exists because we have burned and continue to burn fossil fuels at a prodigious rate.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:49):**  Agricultural land use has a hugely important role to play in mitigating global warming,  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:55):**  but we must assess the impact of farming accurately if we're to make informed decisions about  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:00):**  how best to mitigate the impacts of food production while restoring nature and making judgements  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:06):**  about how much extra farmland we can use to sequester additional carbon on behalf of society.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:12):**  Methane of course remains an important and potent greenhouse gas, but the focus on emissions  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:18):**  has been misleading.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:19):**  GWP Star allows us to set the record straight, and if we promote instead a regenerative approach  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:25):**  to ruminant agriculture, we can help to ensure that farmers produce high quality nutritious  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:31):**  food while mitigating climate change and restoring biodiversity.

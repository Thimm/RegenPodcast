### Farm Gate  (2020-01-08)

**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, I'm Finnlow Castayne and this is Farmgate. Today I'm investigating the contribution  that ruminant methane makes to global warming. Research by a global team of scientists based  at the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford has established a new way of measuring  
**[0:00:21-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:21):**  the impacts of methane. GWP Star allows us to accurately measure the impact of ruminant  methane for the first time. I'll be talking to Professor Miles Allen and Dr John Lynch  from the University of Oxford. Later in the programme I'll speak to Roland Bonney, a  
**[0:00:37-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:37):**  farmer and co-founder of FAI Farms and Benchmark Holdings. Professor Miles Allen is a coordinating  lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on 1.5 degrees,  having served on the IPCC's third, fourth and fifth assessments. He was also the lead  
**[0:00:55-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:00:55):**  scientist on the Oxford Martin methane research team. It's important to stress that this  is not particularly new science. In fact, in many ways we're just drawing out the implications  of science that the community has understood for a very long time. Methane behaves in a  
**[0:01:10-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:10):**  fundamentally different way to carbon dioxide. If you dump a tonne of carbon dioxide into  the atmosphere, it causes warming which persists effectively forever, tens of thousands, even  hundreds of thousands of years. To do the same with methane, you would have to increase  
**[0:01:27-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:27):**  your rate of methane emissions, that's tonnes per year of methane emissions, and then hold  them up forever. And that would have the same impact on global temperature as dumping that  single tonne of carbon dioxide would have. So that's a fundamentally different thing,  
**[0:01:42-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:42):**  but it does mean you can compare methane and CO2, but what you have to do is compare a  change in the emission rate of methane with a single tonne of CO2, a one-off emission  of CO2.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:01:56):**  Dr. John Lynch is a postdoctoral research assistant in the Department of Physics at  the University of Oxford. He was also part of the methane research team. I asked him  to explain the different behavioural characteristics of carbon dioxide and methane.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:11):**  We'll start by thinking about carbon dioxide because this is the most important greenhouse  gas that we emit the most of, and it's by quite a long way the bigger contributor to  global warming, and it's also the reference gas that we compare the other emissions to.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:27):**  So for carbon dioxide, let's say we emit a one-off emission of carbon dioxide today.  There are then various removal processes that will, some of it will get absorbed into the  ocean, some of it will be fixed by plants and trees, but a significant fraction of that  
**[0:02:44-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:44):**  carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere and continue exerting a global warming effect.  Even after centuries to millennia, we'll still have quite a big chunk of the carbon  dioxide still there.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:02:55):**  Did you say centuries and millennia?  Yes, so it will gradually keep declining, the atmospheric increase of carbon dioxide  after our emission, but the rate at which it's removed will get increasingly slow,  
**[0:03:09-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:09):**  and even after millennia, unless we actively remove it, we still expect a significantly  greater carbon dioxide concentration because of our human activities.  So that's CO2.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:19):**  How is methane different to that?  Yeah, so methane is very different because even though, if you imagine emitting one molecule  of methane to one molecule of CO2, that molecule of methane actually has quite a strong warming  
**[0:03:33-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:33):**  impact, quite a lot stronger than the CO2.  But unlike CO2, the methane is going to break down naturally quite quickly.  So after a few decades, if we emit methane today, most of that's going to have been  
**[0:03:45-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:03:45):**  lost from the atmosphere, whereas for CO2, as we've just discussed, it's going to  stay there and carry on accumulating for as long as we keep on the emissions.  So if we were thinking about this with a playground metaphor, methane acts like a sudden punch  
**[0:04:00-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:00):**  in the face, whereas carbon dioxide behaves a bit more like that teacher that just keeps  on at you time after time after time, breaking down your confidence until you're a shrivelling  wreck at the end of your school life.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:13):**  That could be one way to think of it, yes.  A metaphor that my boss is quite keen on, actually, is he would describe methane as  like getting drunk.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:22):**  So you go, you have a few too many beers, and then the next morning, you know, you don't  feel great because of it, but after the next couple of days, it's going to wear off,  and you won't be that much worse for wear for it, whereas carbon dioxide is a bit like  
**[0:04:36-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:36):**  lead poisoning, where if you get lead poisoning, you're going to be stuck with the damage.  And if you keep on having that poisoning, it's just going to get worse and worse and  worse.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:47):**  OK, so between science and metaphor, we've got a pretty clear idea of the way in which  methane behaves differently from carbon dioxide.  Next I asked John to apply that information practically in a farm setting, in particular,  
**[0:04:59-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:04:59):**  to describe the life cycle of methane, where it comes from and where it goes to, in a grass-based  ruminant system.  Yeah, so let's imagine we are setting up a new farm, we've got grass growing there  
**[0:05:13-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:13):**  that the animals eat.  So this grass is growing by pulling carbon out of the atmosphere, so atmospheric carbon  dioxide is fixed into the grass biomass, then your ruminants, or your cow or your sheep  
**[0:05:27-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:27):**  comes along and eats that grass, and they eat the carbon contained in the plant biomass.  Now as a byproduct of the ruminant digestive process, so a process called enteric fermentation,  the bacteria in their gut that are breaking down that plant biomass, some of that carbon  
**[0:05:44-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:44):**  contained in it is converted to methane, and then they belch that out as a byproduct of  their normal ruminant digestion.  The rest of the carbon will go into the animal, which we may then eat, and then through either  
**[0:05:58-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:05:58):**  the animal's respiration or our respiration, the rest of it will be returned as carbon  dioxide.  But that methane component, so the animal eats the grass, the carbon in that, some of  
**[0:06:08-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:08):**  that's converted to methane, the animal breathes out the methane, and then that methane over  the next few decades will also break down back to carbon dioxide.  So we have a carbon cycle going on here over a few decades.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:21):**  Now having this step as methane in the middle does mean that it has an extra climate effect  that it wouldn't if it was just CO2 and respiration cycling around, but it's very distinct from  what's happening with fossil fuels.  
**[0:06:34-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:34):**  So with fossil fuels, we have the carbon trapped up in oil or gas, been buried underground  for millions of years, and then when we burn those fossil fuels, the CO2 that's released,  that's an additional source of carbon that is going to affect the carbon cycle, essentially  
**[0:06:50-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:06:50):**  indefinitely unless we manage to actively remove it again.  So it's a very different kind of impact on the climate between these two types of emissions.  Dr John Lynch.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:01):**  Let's go back to Professor Miles Allen.  The rumour that's heard in Britain and Europe did cause global warming when it was built  up, whenever it was built up, probably centuries ago in many cases.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:14):**  But if that herd is now stable or slightly declining, then it's no longer adding to  the warming it's already caused.  It is of course holding temperatures up.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:25):**  So it's not, you know, just because we're gently reducing our methane emissions, it  doesn't mean that those methane emissions are right now causing significant global cooling,  but they're probably not contributing to any further global warming either.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:43):**  And so that's the very important difference between methane and CO2.  If you were doing the same with CO2 and gently reducing your carbon dioxide emissions, you  would still be contributing to global warming.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:07:56):**  And you'd be still contributing global warming all the time until you got your carbon dioxide  emissions all the way down to zero, because carbon dioxide accumulates in the climate  system as long as you've got any positive, net positive emissions of carbon dioxide associated  
**[0:08:09-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:09):**  with whatever it is you're doing, you're still causing global warming.  So the temperature increase from ruminant methane is historic, and providing that a  herd is stable or slightly declining, there will be no additional increase in global temperatures.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:23):**  There was an initial pulse of warming when the herd was first established, perhaps 50  or 100 years ago.  But even while the herd's methane emissions continue, there will be no additional temperature  
**[0:08:34-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:34):**  increase arising from that herd.  I asked Dr. John Lynch if he could explain the science in just a little bit more detail.  So if we think now, what does this mean in terms of the dynamics of how different emissions  
**[0:08:48-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:08:48):**  relate to temperature change?  It means that for methane, if we had kind of long term emissions at the same rate, eventually,  we would have stable emissions that are just going to be topping up the atmosphere to the  
**[0:09:00-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:00):**  same level, because they're essentially replacing past emissions at the same rate that they're  naturally broken down.  So if we manage to keep emissions of methane at the same rate for more than a few decades,  
**[0:09:11-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:11):**  we're going to have fairly stable temperatures.  So there will be some global warming still occurring because there are long term response  elements of the climate.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:20):**  But ultimately, we're not going to have indefinitely increasing temperatures.  Whereas for carbon dioxide, even if we stabilise CO2 emissions at the same rate, because it's  accumulating, that would mean ever increasing temperatures.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:31):**  So that's the that's the first figure to imagine you have a flat line of emissions for both  of the gases.  That means relatively flat temperatures for methane, but increasing temperatures from  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:41):**  carbon dioxide.  And the even more striking comparison is if we then think about well, what if we managed  to reduce emissions?  
**[0:09:49-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:09:49):**  So again, just coming back down to these same fairly straightforward dynamics that CO2 is  cumulative and methane isn't.  If we decrease CO2 emissions until we finally reach zero, we're only slowing the rate at  
**[0:10:02-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:02):**  which we add extra CO2 to the atmosphere, and then only when we finally stop do we kind  of cap out at a relatively fixed amount of warming for the next few centuries.  But for methane, if we managed to reduce emissions below their current level, then we're kind  
**[0:10:16-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:16):**  of not topping up emissions to the same amount that we are at the moment.  So we'd actually be able to reverse the amount of methane in the atmosphere and reverse some  of the warming that it causes.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:26):**  So if we have declining methane emissions for either gas for CO2, that means extra temperature  increase slows down until it stabilises.  Whereas for methane, it means you're able to reverse some of the past temperature changes.  
**[0:10:39-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:39):**  And if we're trying to deliver stability, if we're trying to make sure that there is  no additional temperature increase from methane as we go forward, am I right in thinking that  emissions need to drop by about 0.3% year on year on year?  
**[0:10:55-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:10:55):**  Yeah, that's right.  So even if we even though if we have stable methane emissions, the amount of methane in  the atmosphere might not increase, there is still a slow adjustment of the climate to  
**[0:11:07-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:07):**  those concentrations.  So we can't just have stable methane for no warming, we need to have a slow gradual decline,  or a slight offset from removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:19):**  And that's how we would be able to have stable temperatures.  Whereas for carbon dioxide, the only way to have stable temperatures is just to stop emitting  the gas.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:27):**  And so if we were to encapsulate that more detailed description that you've given there,  would it be accurate to say that the emissions can continue from cattle, but providing there  is that very slight reduction year on year, while the emissions continue, the temperature  
**[0:11:46-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:46):**  does not continue to increase?  Yeah, so the way I think about this is that we have our climate objectives to try and  stop warming before one and a half or two degrees.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:11:58):**  So the assumption there is that it's based around stabilising temperature without exceeding  these thresholds.  So to stabilise temperature, you have to cut out co2 emissions completely or completely  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:09):**  offset any emissions you do have going on.  And that's a physical requirement.  There's no getting around it.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:15):**  But for methane, it is possible to have some ongoing emissions without ever increasing  temperatures.  There's Dr. John Lynch there explaining the underlying science.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:26):**  Next I asked him about the metric GWP star, which updates the standard metric used by  governments to analyse global warming potential, and which is embedded in global treaties.  The GWP star metric allows us for the first time to accurately account for the global  
**[0:12:41-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:41):**  warming impact of methane.  So what what GWP star can capture when you when you apply it to the two different gases  is essentially that if you introduce a new source of methane emissions, that has a very  
**[0:12:54-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:12:54):**  different impact to if you simply sustain a previously long term ongoing methane emission.  So if you add your new methane source over the first 20 years, that has a very big climate  impact.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:08):**  And you'd actually underestimate that impact from using the conventional global warming  potential.  But after the first few decades, you already experienced most of the warming that you're  
**[0:13:16-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:16):**  ever going to from having introduced that new methane.  So from that point onwards, GWP star will describe it as a smaller CO2 equivalence compared  to the conventional application of the metric.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:27):**  So that's that's the real fundamental implication of if you're trying to relate how do my emissions  contribute to climate change, you need to have this distinct kind of temporal understanding  to be able to know, well, if I continue or add or remove methane emissions, what's that  
**[0:13:43-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:43):**  going to mean for the climate in 1020 3040 years time, that's what you can use GWP star  to answer.  So that's what GWP star does.  
**[0:13:53-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:13:53):**  Next I asked Professor Miles Allen, why the new metric should be adopted by governments  and the global science community.  The government measures is emissions based on this rather arbitrary GWP 100 standard.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:06):**  And what we're proposing is if we're aiming to end our contribution to global warming,  as Theresa May put it when they announced the net zero goal, if that's the objective, then  we should really be measuring emissions in terms of their contribution to global warming.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:22):**  That seems like a natural way to to compare things.  And what we've done in our research is really just to show how easy it is, if you like,  to compute the impact of different gases on actual global temperatures, rather than this  
**[0:14:38-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:38):**  nominal carbon dioxide equivalent number, which actually doesn't relate directly to  global temperature change at all.  So it strikes me that we're interested in emissions really as a proxy for what we're  
**[0:14:50-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:14:50):**  actually interested in, which is the warming from those emissions.  So it, you know, it makes complete sense to to measure things in that way.  What's been the response of government and the global science community when you've presented  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:02):**  this science?  Well, as I said at the outset, the science here is not particularly controversial at  all.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:08):**  It's the implications that some people find controversial, because we've got a policy  community that's got a established, they built up practices and so on based on this notion  of carbon dioxide equivalents.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:23):**  And people are nervous about the implications of any change to that.  I don't think, however, keeping on with a flawed accounting system just because it's  the one you're using is sustainable in the long term.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:38):**  So I think it's important we get these ideas out there.  And also really important to emphasize to them that we are using the same data that's  already been reported.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:47):**  We're just suggesting a different way of processing it, which actually reflects impact  on global temperature much better.  So it's not a particularly radical change to what people are having to do anyway.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:15:59):**  Professor Miles Allen, at this point, we have a working understanding of the science and  of the updated global warming potential metric GWP star.  But what does this mean in practical terms?  
**[0:16:11-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:11):**  How important is the science and what difference will it actually make?  Roland Bonney is a co-founder of FAI Farms and Benchmark Holdings.  And in 2018, when the methane research was first published, he immediately recognized  
**[0:16:24-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:24):**  its importance.  Over the last 18 months, FAI Farms and my organization Farmwell have worked with the  Oxford Martin team to bring this science to the attention of farmers' organizations and  
**[0:16:36-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:36):**  to governments.  The research is important because it fixes an anomaly in the way in which we've accounted  for the warming impact of methane.  
**[0:16:44-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:16:44):**  And it allows farmers to accurately assess their farm's warming contributions and therefore  accurately identify what they can do to mitigate that contribution.  So over the last couple of years or so, the media has been full of how methane is a real  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:02):**  problem.  That's where all of the attention should lie.  And therefore, cattle and sheep are a real problem.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:08):**  Well, everything that has emissions obviously is making a contribution one way or another  to climate warming.  But the situation around cattle and sheep or around ruminants has been exaggerated because  
**[0:17:23-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:23):**  the metric is a very poor metric.  The new metric is accurate and approximately halves the impact of the methane, halves the  number that reflects the warming impact of the methane.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:35):**  And in reality, what it means is that if we stabilize methane and reduce them or mitigate  in other ways, but reduce them at about 0.3% per animal, 10% over 30 years, which could  be done with a small reduction in livestock or can be done through mitigating in other  
**[0:17:52-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:17:52):**  ways, essentially those animals, those ruminants are not contributing in terms of their methane  output to increased heating.  And when you say mitigating in other ways, I imagine that you're talking about things  
**[0:18:06-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:06):**  like tree planting.  So how does that work?  Are we are we talking about sort of plantations next to a farm in order to mitigate that or  
**[0:18:15-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:15):**  is it in some way integrated like agroforestry?  Well, I think this is another problem at the moment is a lot of the modeling that's been  done that's fueling some of the headline discussions with regard to land use, for example, planting  
**[0:18:30-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:30):**  the uplands just takes into account the benefits of having tree and the carbon that's soaked  up by those trees over the next 60 years.  It doesn't take into account the carbon that's already there, much of which would be lost  
**[0:18:42-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:42):**  because if you plant grasslands with trees, as the tree grows, the grassland, when we  get towards canopy cover, the grassland dies off.  And therefore, the numbers have been overblown in terms of that land use change in terms  
**[0:18:55-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:18:55):**  of the benefits.  There's also there's been very little discussion as to the stability of that biological carbon  in the terms of fast tracks of forests, which at 15 years of age are going to be highly  
**[0:19:07-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:07):**  prone to fires.  I'm not suggesting quite the scale that we're seeing in Australia, but there will be fires  that there are now and the more woodland and the more dead grass we have, the more likely  
**[0:19:18-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:18):**  we are to have fires.  And we need to recognize, we need to manage our land if we want to seriously lock up carbon  and that requires intervention, it requires thought.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:28):**  And the best way probably to do this on a national scale is through the national patchwork,  the patchwork of sort of quilt like nature of our British landscape, where we have trees  across our landscape, we have fire breaks in the form of livestock, graze fields, we  
**[0:19:46-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:46):**  have crops and we have mixed rotations.  I think that's probably the best solution.  So at the moment, sort of central to the government's policy seems to be this idea of a sparing off.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:19:59):**  They're talking about taking 20% of land out of production for tree planting.  Other people are wanting land taken out for rewilding.  And then it's almost as though, you know, the food that's being produced is going to  
**[0:20:12-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:12):**  be produced in even in ever smaller pockets of land and presumably more intensively.  I think, I think the again, the arguments have been polarized into sharing and sparing.  And I think they're unhelpful polar opposites or appear to be that way.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:29):**  I think there are areas of the country that will and are being, you know, where agriculture  is withdrawing from those areas.  I think so there is an opportunity for areas to be, you know, wilded as some would call  
**[0:20:42-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:20:42):**  it and certainly opportunities for tree planting and therefore establishing larger scale woodlands.  But there's a far greater opportunity to integrate back into the biology of nature, the whole  of our food system at a national level.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:01):**  So if I was to summarize that and I know that's slightly crass, then you're saying some sparing,  a lot of sharing.  Yeah, I think some sparing.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:10):**  I think we've already seen, we're seeing some of that.  We've seen a lot of it, certainly in parts of Scotland.  But, you know, a lot of sharing would be the way forward, because then we can have a rich  
**[0:21:21-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:21):**  patchwork quill of diverse food stuffs grown locally, corridors for wildlife and biodiversity  and the ability for it to move and breathe across the whole of our landscape, not just  in pockets away from people.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:39):**  So I think that that is the better way forward.  And I think we will achieve far more going down that route, because I think that will  be supported by the farming community and the landowners.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:49):**  Whereas if we're if we turn to them and just say, we want you to stop and we're only going  to encourage this 30 percent of farmers to carry on, I think we'll you know, we'll be  arguing about that for the next 50 years.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:21:59):**  I know a lot of farmers phone you up and talk to you.  And I wonder if you could tell me how farmers are feeling at the moment about the way that  the way that the media is talking about them and the emissions that are related to farming  
**[0:22:13-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:13):**  and how farmers respond when they hear about this this updated metric.  Well, as you can expect, there's a range of responses.  I think that the fundamental response is captured in two things that come out strongly.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:27):**  One is shock.  They're shocked that the media is turned on them in this way.  They don't feel that they're being represented fairly in this debate.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:36):**  And I think, you know, with some reason and the idea that the food chain can be turned  on its head in the way some are suggesting in the sort of time frame that's being suggested.  I think for most farmers don't believe that that's possible or likely.  
**[0:22:49-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:22:49):**  I see farmers, they're like a standing army and they're sprung on wire to respond to these  challenges.  But we need a constructive partnership between government, consumer and farmer or maybe government  
**[0:23:01-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:01):**  citizen and farmer, because it isn't just about what the consumer wants or doesn't want  to eat.  The critical issue here is how we farm and how we use our land to provide us with a diverse  
**[0:23:09-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:09):**  nutritious diet and at the same time stabilise climate and biodiversity.  The farmers that are phoning me up and that I'm talking to are passionate about tackling  climate change.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:21):**  They're passionate about addressing diversity.  They just want clarity on that partnership with government and consumer or citizen to  allow them to do that.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:33):**  Now, we know we're not going to get complete agreement.  People have different views as to what we should do and what we shouldn't do.  But we have to remember that these, for millennia, these farms have been farmed by families and  
**[0:23:46-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:46):**  society has been happy to support that.  And there's a huge amount of trust in farmers.  What we need to do now is create an environment where we can empower them to get on and hit  
**[0:23:57-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:23:57):**  the targets that have been identified by the NFU 2040 and to be net zero warming impact  is doable, but only if we get on with that partnership with a healthy partnership in  the interim.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:11):**  That was Roland Bonney.  So what difference does GWP Star make to the warming impact of individual farms?  To find out, we've run the numbers on several farms with the Oxford Martin team.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:23):**  We used the SRUC carbon calculator as the basis for analysing greenhouse gas emissions  and then applied GWP Star to recalculate the warming impact of methane.  FAI Farms near Oxford is primarily a cattle and sheep operation.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:37):**  The impact of greenhouse gases is still described in terms of CO2 equivalents and as you might  expect their carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide values remain the same.  Their methane emissions value, however, under GWP Star fell by 75%.  
**[0:24:54-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:24:54):**  Factored together, the whole farm climate impact fell by half.  In Northumberland, we visited a sheep farm.  Again, the methane emissions value fell by 75%, with the whole farm emissions dropping  
**[0:25:06-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:06):**  by 52%.  When we consider these numbers, we can see clearly that the global warming impact of  ruminant methane has been greatly exaggerated.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:16):**  Metrics matter and under the old metric, the inaccurate representation of agricultural  methane has allowed attention to be diverted away from fossil fuels.  Professor Miles Allen again.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:28):**  Of course, we should be focusing on fossil fuels because most of the warming caused to  date has been caused by carbon dioxide from fossil fuels.  Most of the warming caused in the future under all scenarios is caused by carbon dioxide  
**[0:25:40-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:40):**  from fossil fuels.  Methane is an important contributor.  It is a very powerful greenhouse gas.  
**[0:25:47-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:25:47):**  It does therefore matter.  It may in some cases be easier to reduce methane emissions than carbon dioxide emissions.  Some of our methane emissions at the moment come from the natural gas industry just operating  
**[0:26:00-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:00):**  leaky pipes.  That's, in my view, is unforgivable.  Just finally, would you say that your research shows that methane can be a get out of jail  
**[0:26:09-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:09):**  free card that we could play now to give us a good strong pulse of cooling if we dramatically  reduce cattle and sheep numbers today?  Well, that is what would happen, but it would only happen once.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:21):**  And so if you reduce temperatures temporarily, and it wouldn't be that much, it would be  at the order of a tenth of a degree at absolute maximum, maybe even less.  You know, that's only a few years of warming due to carbon dioxide as CO2 emissions continue.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:39):**  So you know, you level off temperatures very temporarily and then they carry on rising.  The important point to stress therefore is action on methane can help, but at the end  of the day, if we're still piling on warming in degree by degree with fossil fuels, then  
**[0:26:59-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:26:59):**  actions that affect global temperatures at the level of a tenth of a degree to some extent  do risk becoming a bit of a distraction.  And I am quite concerned by how much of the conversation around climate change has been  
**[0:27:12-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:12):**  diverted onto these measures.  It's not just methane, it's many other measures that would make a relatively small difference  to the outcome when the big element in the corner is the fact that we are still using  
**[0:27:25-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:25):**  fossil fuels at an ever faster rate.  And until we get the fossil fuel CO2 problem under control, which means bringing net fossil  fuel emissions to zero, we're going to carry on warming the climate.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:37):**  Professor Miles Allen, climate change doesn't exist because people farm cattle and sheep.  It exists because we have burned and continue to burn fossil fuels at a prodigious rate.  Agricultural land use has a hugely important role to play in mitigating global warming,  
**[0:27:55-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:27:55):**  but we must assess the impact of farming accurately if we're to make informed decisions about  how best to mitigate the impacts of food production while restoring nature and making judgements  about how much extra farmland we can use to sequester additional carbon on behalf of society.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:12):**  Methane of course remains an important and potent greenhouse gas, but the focus on emissions  has been misleading.  GWP Star allows us to set the record straight, and if we promote instead a regenerative approach  
**[0:28:25-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:25):**  to ruminant agriculture, we can help to ensure that farmers produce high quality nutritious  food while mitigating climate change and restoring biodiversity.  If you want to know more, then you can Google methane and Oxford Martin and you'll go  
**[0:28:40-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Ruminant-methane--global-warming---GWP-ea27m1#t=0:28:40):**  straight to the relevant page and be able to download pamphlets explaining this research.

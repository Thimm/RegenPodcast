### Farm Gate  (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 10:15:26)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Kirstein. Today I'm talking to Robin O'Brien,  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:11):**  who in September 2020 was named in the Forbes Impact 50, a list of the top impact investors  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:17):**  in the USA. A key influencer around food quality and health in particular, Robin is the best-selling  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:23):**  author of The Unhealthy Truth and her TED Talks have received over a million views.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:29):**  Today we're here to talk about Replant Capital, a new fund to help finance scalable climate  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:34):**  solutions. It's based in the USA and it's worth $250 million. Replant's flagship fund,  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:41):**  its soil fund, is focused on the transition of American farmland to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:47):**  Welcome to the programme, Robin. And I wonder if we could just sort of start at the beginning.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:52):**  What is Replant Capital and what do you think it is that makes it special?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:00:56):**  Well, thanks so much for having me. It's great to be with you today and thank you for asking  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:00):**  what makes Replant special. We clearly believe that there's an enormous opportunity to really  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:05):**  step into a leadership role and invite others to do the same and think about capital as  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:10):**  the most important ingredient in our food and agricultural system. We all around the  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:14):**  world have inherited a very extractive, very broken food and agricultural system. And you  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:19):**  can see that play out by what is actually happening to the financial and economic wellbeing  
**[0:01:24-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:24):**  of farmers. And as we looked at that, we thought, you know, there is no food security if there  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:29):**  is not financial security for farmers and there is no climate security unless we really  
**[0:01:34-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:34):**  get at this issue of soil health. So as we were really putting our heads together, there  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:38):**  are three co-founders, myself, Dave Haynes, who comes from a private equity background  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:43):**  and the company was a B Corp. And then Don Schafer, who comes from an integrated capital  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:47):**  background as the CEO of RSF Social Finance for 10 years. We put our heads together and  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:52):**  we thought, how can we create a financial services firm that is mindful and aware and  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:01:57):**  integrated with these issues as opposed to extractive? Because so many of the financial  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:03):**  partners that come into these partnerships for food and ag, they come from a very extractive  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:07):**  place. They don't have an understanding. They aren't mission aligned. They aren't value  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:11):**  driven. They're simply there as the bank to extract what they can from that client. And  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:15):**  as a result, we now have inherited these very extractive, very broken financial and agricultural  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:20):**  systems. So we flipped it and we said, you know, what would it look like if capital was  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:25):**  value aligned? What would it look like if there was a financial services firm that was  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:29):**  mission driven and value aligned with a team that understood not only food, but understood  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:33):**  the economic and the financial crisis that's happening on U.S. farmland? And you highlight,  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:39):**  you know, the U.S. farmers. That's who we're starting with. We've had to be very disciplined  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:43):**  in the beginning of the fund. It's a 250 million dollar fund, as you highlighted, really disciplined  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:48):**  on working with replacing these extractive loan terms that American farmers have been  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:53):**  under and replacing them with loans that are actually tied to soil health. So if you want  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:02:58):**  to talk about that a little bit, you know, that's where we get really excited, because  
**[0:03:01-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:01):**  loan terms are always dictated by the banks. And there was not a lot of creativity and  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:05):**  there was not a lot of innovation. And for whatever reason, the financial industry sort  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:09):**  of got stuck. The rest of the world has moved into the 21st century. We talk about pretty  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:14):**  much every other industry in a very different way today than we were 20 or 30 years ago.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:19):**  But for whatever reason, the financial world got stuck. And so they're measuring these  
**[0:03:23-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:23):**  food companies and these agricultural companies using the same metrics they always have for  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:27):**  the last 30, 40, 50, 100 years. The invitation is to really update that and say, you know,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:32):**  what are the metrics that are relevant to 21st century farming? What are the metrics  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:36):**  that are relevant to a 21st century shareholder? What are the metrics that are relevant to  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:41):**  a 21st century food company? And if you were to be in an interview or in a conversation  
**[0:03:46-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:46):**  with General Mills or Nestle or Denone or any of these companies, they are capturing  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:50):**  different metrics today than they were capturing 30 years ago. But Wall Street's not asking  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:03:55):**  for that. So we've got a really antiquated, outdated, ignorant financial system as a partner  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:01):**  in food and ag.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:02):**  Well, let's get into that information about the metrics and the loan repayment terms and  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:07):**  that sort of thing a bit later. But let's sort of take a step backwards, if we may,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:11):**  at this stage. And in the UK, where I'm based, the whole conversation about regenerative  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:16):**  agriculture is probably only about two years old. Is it a longer timeline in the USA? Have  
**[0:04:20-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:20):**  you been talking about regen ag for longer?  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:22):**  That's a great question. So, yes, in the United States, we have an institution, an organisation  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:27):**  called the Rodale Institute. And the founder of the Rodale Institute was actually talking  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:31):**  about regenerative agriculture 60 years ago. I think, you know, as we as we think about  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:37):**  this and as we consider what is now emerging as this very powerful force in food and ag,  
**[0:04:41-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:41):**  a lot of times we get the question, you know, what is regenerative agriculture? I think  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:46):**  to step back from that just a little bit, the bigger question is, what is soil health?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:50):**  How are we defining soil health? Because how we define soil health is actually how we define  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:04:56):**  regenerative agriculture. So we've been talking about soil health for a while. And in the  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:01):**  last 10 years with soil scientists, there's really been this emergence of this realisation  
**[0:05:06-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:06):**  again, leveraging 21st century technology, that soil serves as a really powerful database.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:13):**  So now that we have this awareness and the technology and the tools to access that database  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:18):**  that is soil, that's the conversation that's changing. And that's my point exactly with  
**[0:05:23-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:23):**  the prior issue is, is we are in the 21st century and we have tools and we have metrics  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:27):**  and we have technology that we didn't have 30 years ago. So it changes our ability to  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:31):**  talk about these things. So as we begin to talk about soil health, and the regeneration  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:36):**  of soil health, we can then include these metrics like carbon sequestration, water conservation,  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:41):**  water infiltration, soil organic matter, nutrient density, we can talk about these metrics today,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:47):**  because we now have tools to capture that data. If you want to flip it, if we talk about  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:52):**  regeneration, the reason we've all been brought to this point of talking about regeneration  
**[0:05:56-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:05:56):**  is because agriculture up until this point has been about degenerating, it has degenerated  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:02):**  the soil, and degeneration has been the issue we have extracted and extracted and extracted,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:08):**  both financially from the farmers that are serving the soil and serving the food and  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:12):**  ag industry. And we have extracted so much from the soil itself through this agrochemical  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:17):**  model that was so widely embraced for the last 30 years. So all of a sudden, we've all  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:22):**  kind of hit this point where we've realized, wow, we can't extract more financially from  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:27):**  farmers. I mean, in the United States, US farmers carry $426 billion of debt, that income  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:33):**  on a farm on any given year is in the it's negative, it's a negative $1,800. So I can't  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:39):**  imagine trying to sell that proposition to any 30 year old who wants to go into farming.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:43):**  So we've got a really, really upside down economic and financial situation for farmers.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:49):**  And then on top of that, as they took out more and more loans to finance that agrochemical  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:53):**  model, they got further and further into debt. And so we have applied these agrochemicals  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:06:58):**  across the soil, harming the soil, we now know we stand on soil that is damaged. And  
**[0:07:03-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:03):**  then at the same time, we've got this economic problem for the farmer. And that duality is  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:07):**  what we saw as both the problem and the enormous opportunity to come in and say, what does  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:12):**  it look like to think about capital in a regenerative way for the farmer at the same time we're  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:17):**  talking about regeneration of the soil.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:19):**  And that experience that you describe of the debt burden that's on US farmers, of course,  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:24):**  you know, that's replicated in so many countries around the world. And I'm, I'm interested  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:28):**  because of course, you know, some of the people that you're looking to fund and that you're  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:32):**  working with the people like carbon cowboy, Will Harris from White Oak Pastures, and you  
**[0:07:37-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:37):**  know, he has turned his whole business around.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:40):**  Exactly. And I think, you know, Will's a great example, because in our conversations, I asked  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:44):**  him once I said, what was the hardest part for you transitioning to regenerative agriculture?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:49):**  Because as you highlighted, I mean, these guys are fifth, six, sometimes seventh generation  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:54):**  farmers that have been farming conventionally. So in that initial transition, that can feel  
**[0:07:59-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:07:59):**  pretty radical. And I asked him, I said, what was the hardest part? And he paused, and he  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:03):**  got really quiet. And he said, I'll tell you what the best part was, the best part was  
**[0:08:08-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:08):**  that my kids came back to the farm. And so again, if we're going to be talking about  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:13):**  food security, if we're going to be talking about farming in any country, and you're right,  
**[0:08:17-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:17):**  because I have dual citizenship, my mother is from New Zealand, the debt levels in New  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:21):**  Zealand are equal, equal to debt levels here in the United States, when you look at the  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:25):**  percentages, if we're going to be talking about food security for any country, we absolutely  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:30):**  have to secure that career, we have to secure that legacy and that succession of farmers,  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:36):**  young farmers, stepping into this and taking over the farm. And so what we're hearing from  
**[0:08:41-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:41):**  farmers is, and what I love about the regenerative movement in the United States is that what's  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:45):**  happening is the farmers are coming in first, this isn't being dictated by the consumer,  
**[0:08:50-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:50):**  some of the food companies are pretty loud about it. But it's the farmers themselves  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:53):**  who are coming in, out of curiosity, out of concern that their kids don't want to take  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:08:58):**  over the farm out of concern for the debt levels out of concern for soil health, because  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:02):**  they're standing on that soil that they have routinely treated for 20 or 30 years of these  
**[0:09:07-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:07):**  chemicals, and they understand what has happened to it. So if you're going to go from this  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:11):**  kind of really intense chemical input model, which is what we have had for the last 20  
**[0:09:15-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:15):**  or 30 years, really, with genetically engineered crops, and all of the portfolios of chemicals  
**[0:09:20-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:20):**  and herbicides and fungicides and insecticides, if we're going to go from that chemical input  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:24):**  model and all of the debt that was required to finance it into a service model, the other  
**[0:09:30-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:30):**  piece that's going to be required are these technical assistance partners. So guys and  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:34):**  women on the ground, who can walk a farmer through that transition. And again, it's  
**[0:09:39-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:39):**  not going to be one size fits all. You got a guy like Will out in Georgia, and the technical  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:44):**  assistance and expertise that he's going to need to transition to regenerative is going  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:49):**  to be so different to the technical expertise that would be required of almond growers in  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:54):**  the San Joaquin Valley in California.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:09:56):**  Before we come into the detail around the type of loans and the metrics and that sort  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:00):**  of thing, I just wonder if I could talk to you, Robin, about your own journey, because  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:03):**  it's, you know, it's quite unique. You did a TED Talk about the connection between food  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:08):**  quality and health maybe 10 years ago. But I wonder if you could talk us a little bit  
**[0:10:12-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:12):**  about your background and how you came to be involved in this work.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:16):**  Yeah, my entire career has been in food and agriculture. And I'm actually named after  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:21):**  a farmer who lives in New Zealand in Palmerston North. You know, I think back to that. And  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:25):**  it's, it has always been the work that I have done when I got out of graduate school and  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:29):**  got out of business school. I joined an investment team. I was the only woman on the team. So  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:34):**  the guys had me cover the food industry. I was not in any way emotional about this. I  
**[0:10:38-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:38):**  was not in any way dialed into organic. This was back in the late 1990s, early 2000s. And  
**[0:10:43-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:43):**  so I simply was analyzing the food industry from that purely mechanical analytical place.  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:48):**  My heart was not involved in all and I liked it that way. It was safe, you know, but I  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:52):**  could see how, and we were celebrating this at the time, how real ingredients were taken  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:10:57):**  out, artificial ingredients were put in, drove margins, drove profitability. And that's what  
**[0:11:01-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:01):**  we rewarded in the marketplace. That's what we were looking for as shareholders. So I  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:05):**  understood that incredible drive and that incredible pressure on these companies by  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:10):**  Wall Street because I was one of the people doing it. So, you know, as we sat with those  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:14):**  teams and learn those models, and then a few years later, we started our family and we  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:19):**  moved to Colorado. So to move from Texas to Colorado at that point in time was like moving  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:24):**  from Earth to Mars. You couldn't have picked two cultures that were more different going  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:28):**  from oil and gas centered economy out into the Rocky Mountains, you know, where nature  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:33):**  and the environment, everything was protected and taken care of. So as I was moving into  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:37):**  this space, it was sort of that awareness, you know, like this whole other way of thinking  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:42):**  about things. And then my kids got sick. And so as the kids were getting sick, I was looking  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:47):**  at food because they were having these reactions. And as I was looking at the size of these  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:51):**  boxes, I was like, what in the world is this stuff? You know, we had compensated the management  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:11:56):**  teams because they were driving profitability. But when you suddenly flip that box of mac  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:01):**  and cheese over, we're not just talking about noodles and milk and cheese anymore. You know,  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:06):**  there's a list of probably 29 ingredients that you can't pronounce. And so as I was  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:10):**  turning back into that, you know, coming at it from this different angle as a mother of  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:15):**  a child that was sick, I went back to my team and I said, you know, all of these chemicals  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:19):**  that are that are now in our food system, why did we not cover that when I was covering  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:23):**  the food industry? And they said, well, the chemical industry analyst covered that. And  
**[0:12:26-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:26):**  I said, well, these these shouldn't be in two separate buckets. You know, if the food  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:30):**  industry is using genetically engineered ingredients and Roundup at record levels, we should be  
**[0:12:36-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:36):**  talking about that in those conversations that we're having with the food industry.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:40):**  And I felt so strongly about that, of marrying those two things back together, because by  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:45):**  separating them, they had been able to avoid some of these harder conversations. And the  
**[0:12:50-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:50):**  further I got down that path, talking to former analysts talking to different partners that  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:12:54):**  I had worked with, the more I understood why. And it had really been this effort to keep  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:00):**  the consumer in the dark. And you guys in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India, China,  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:05):**  Russia, everybody labeled genetically engineered ingredients when they were first introduced  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:08):**  in the 1990s. In the US, we were never informed, we were never told and they were never labeled.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:14):**  And to me, that was such a massive infringement on our freedoms, and on our right to know.  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:20):**  And it really challenged sort of how I viewed our ability to have information and freedom  
**[0:13:25-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:25):**  of access and an informed choice as an American. And so I began to make to make noise on that.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:31):**  And it was incredibly uncomfortable. I come from a really conservative family in the south  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:35):**  and to have to sort of step out and speak out. I mean, people would use the word activists,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:40):**  and I was like, that's not the right word. This is just, you know, it's driven by love.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:44):**  This is a love thing. It's so wrong that we haven't been told this. And if you love your  
**[0:13:48-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:48):**  family, of course, you want to make the best choice. But how can you make the best choice  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:51):**  if you don't even know that this change had happened? And so as I did,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:13:56):**  Did you find when you started doing that, that other people started coming out of the  
**[0:14:00-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:00):**  woodwork, mothers and fathers around you and started, you know, realizing that you were  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:04):**  championing something really important? Yes, but that did not happen immediately.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:08):**  In the very beginning, people looked at me like I had three heads. I mean, no one was  
**[0:14:10-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:10):**  talking about GMOs. And it was, you know, no one could believe that the US government  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:15):**  had introduced an entire new modality to agriculture without informing the public. I mean, that's  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:19):**  a pretty big challenge, you know, and so I had to say, Look, this has really happened.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:24):**  And the way that I was able to convince people was to take Kellogg's or Kraft or one of these  
**[0:14:30-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:30):**  American food companies and show two boxes side by side of the two boxes and the different  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:36):**  ingredients and how in the US, we use these cheaper, chemically packed, you know, ingredients  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:41):**  and products. And then in Europe, for example, you aren't allowed to use artificial colors  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:46):**  that are linked to hyperactivity, you aren't allowed to use the high fructose corn syrup.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:50):**  And if they're genetically engineered ingredients, and they're labeled, and when you can see  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:14:54):**  that exact same box side by side with two very different ingredient panels by our own  
**[0:15:00-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:00):**  American companies, that was the game changer. That's when people were like, you know what,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:04):**  that absolutely ticks me off, because what they're doing is they're making cheaper ingredients  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:10):**  for our families that put our families at risk while they are making better ingredients  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:14):**  and better products for families overseas. And that double standard was a universal offense.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:19):**  And so once I landed on that, once I could talk about that and say, Look, here's an example  
**[0:15:24-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:24):**  of how it's played out against us. That was when people mobilized around it. That's when  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:30):**  other families and other organizations started to mobilize, but there were probably two to  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:35):**  three years to at least two to three years in there that were just painfully isolating.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:41):**  Being tenacious. Yeah, yeah. So that was your sort of entry point into sustainable food.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:46):**  And obviously, you've traveled a million miles, and now you're part of replant. How did that  
**[0:15:53-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:53):**  come about?  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:54):**  So you know, it was really interesting, because we, all three of us come from, we've all been  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:15:58):**  in this space our entire careers, but you know, coming in through very different doors.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:03):**  And so for me, you know, as I began to speak out on this, and then really, you know, Random  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:07):**  House published my book in 2009. But it was really that 2011 TED Talk that really was  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:12):**  the catalyst. And that was a terrifying moment, because you're standing on that stage completely  
**[0:16:16-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:16):**  by yourself, you know, and you're delivering this story. And one of the first CEOs that  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:22):**  I heard from was the CEO of Nestle's frozen food division. And he reached out and he said,  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:26):**  Look, you can say things I can't say. And he said, I'm deeply concerned about what's  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:31):**  happening here. The shareholders don't understand, my board doesn't understand, you know, if  
**[0:16:36-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:36):**  I keep going down this path, I'm going to be laying off my employees who are like family.  
**[0:16:39-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:39):**  So he was an incredibly good guy, and had me come out to Ohio to meet with his team.  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:45):**  And as we started, as I started to work through this, you know, I began consulting with these  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:49):**  different companies to really help them understand the fundamental shift in the 21st century  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:16:56):**  consumer, the fact that things like food allergies and diabetes and pediatric cancer, they are  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:00):**  not a fad, they are not a trend. These were actual data points that we could sit down  
**[0:17:05-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:05):**  and discuss and explain why the 21st century consumer was looking for free from food. So  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:11):**  it began to shift their portfolio with Nestle, for example, seven years later, they were  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:16):**  able to introduce an allergen free USDA organic GMO free, you know, chocolate chip, and it  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:22):**  took that long. So once the food industry realized they were on the wrong side of this  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:27):**  issue, they began to acquire the organic companies like Annie's and Applegate. And that began  
**[0:17:32-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:32):**  to change the DNA inside these companies, it also began to change the leadership inside  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:36):**  these companies, we still have the problem where Wall Street didn't have a clue. So you  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:40):**  know, Wall Street's still grading General Mills and Nestle and all of these publicly  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:44):**  traded companies on those same old metrics from 1975, instead of asking them about conversion  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:49):**  to organic farmland, and what are the, you know, programs that you have in place. And  
**[0:17:53-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:17:53):**  so it quickly became clear from these multinationals that the supply chain was the crisis. And  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:00):**  we had, the consumer had moved into the 21st century, the consumer was asking for free  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:05):**  from food, because of all these conditions that we see now in the US. The problem was  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:10):**  that, you know, if 80% of consumers were asking for organic, and now 75% of grocery store  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:15):**  categories are carrying something organic, because these companies listened, the problem  
**[0:18:20-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:20):**  is that only 1% of US farmland is organic. So you can't grow an industry on 1%. And as  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:27):**  I would meet with these executives, I realized Wall Street wasn't going to give them the  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:31):**  bandwidth to convert that farmland, because Wall Street's grilling them and drilling down  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:35):**  on them on that quarterly earnings model every three months, what is this? What is this?  
**[0:18:39-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:39):**  What is this? You can't convert farmland in three months, that's a three year process.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:44):**  So that timeline tension created a problem for these brands that knew that the consumer  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:50):**  had moved into the 21st century. They knew that the consumer was asking for organic food,  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:18:55):**  they were developing the product line, but the supply chain isn't there. So somebody  
**[0:19:00-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:00):**  needed to step in. Yeah, I was frustrated because the organic industry was doing an  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:04):**  amazing job, sort of on the consumer side of things. And on the shelf side, and the  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:08):**  innovation there was great. Nobody was looking at procurement and nobody was trying to solve  
**[0:19:13-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:13):**  for supply chain at scale. And Dave Haynes, who was private equity at Greenmont Capital,  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:21):**  he was frustrated because at that point, everything was just, it was just flipping deals, and  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:24):**  it was hot. And it was, again, the values were starting to erode. And then Don Schafer  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:29):**  had come in from the debt side. And he had seen how hard it was for some of these companies  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:34):**  to get access to capital and loans. So the three of us were putting our heads together.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:37):**  And we thought, you know, how do we actually solve for the supply chain crisis? And how  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:43):**  do we come in and actually provide capital? And so the concept of the SOIL Fund emerged  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:48):**  and what's been fascinating is that it's been, you know, again, like, we're not talking to  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:53):**  Wall Street, like those guys are stuck, you know, we could be banging our heads against  
**[0:19:56-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:19:56):**  those walls for the next decade. Our focus was there's a lot of capital, philanthropic  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:01):**  capital, high net worth individuals, family foundations, donor advised funds, there is  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:05):**  a lot of capital that is out there. And it needs, you know, for us, it was as that capital  
**[0:20:11-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:11):**  was channeled and transitioned into regenerative agriculture. So we really emerged as a very  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:20):**  powerful platform for that capture. And what has been absolutely fascinating is that a  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:25):**  lot of our lead investors are female. A lot of them are women, a lot of them are mothers,  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:30):**  and you don't even have to get four sentences in before they understand exactly what this  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:34):**  is about.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:35):**  So help me clarify here, you've got $250 million. And as I understand it, the plan is to use  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:40):**  80% of that for loans, and 20% of it going towards investments in regen agri tech. And  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:47):**  so so how does that break down? When you talk about the soil fund? What is that within that  
**[0:20:52-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:52):**  $250 million?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:53):**  So the soil fund is $250 million, 80% of that. So 200 million of that is are these loans  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:20:58):**  that we are deploying to farmers. And, you know, it's when we sit down with Danone and  
**[0:21:03-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:03):**  these companies like General Mills or Driscolls, you know, to sit down with them, and they  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:07):**  say, our farmers are under these enormously extractive terms. We want to replace those  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:14):**  and have capital that's aligned with this greater mission. So with Danone, for example,  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:18):**  this is powerful stuff, all of the savings that they generate through the loans that  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:23):**  they will be offered through replant and through the soil fund, whatever savings are generated,  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:28):**  those savings are going to be immediately deployed back into regenerative agriculture  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:31):**  and other regenerative projects. And so you know, we have the opportunity to say, you  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:36):**  know, this extractive capital, these extractive terms can be replaced by regenerative capital  
**[0:21:42-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:42):**  and regenerative terms that allow a farmer to actually grow into regenerative agriculture  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:48):**  and grow into organic agriculture, because it's at the point like you touched on earlier,  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:53):**  they are in such a financial crisis that even if they wanted to transition, they don't have  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:21:58):**  the financial bandwidth to do it. So we realized you had to go in there and create that bandwidth.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:03):**  So 80% of the fund are these, you know, reconstructing these loans to farmers, and then 20% of the  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:09):**  fund, so 50 million is in the space of ag technology. And the reason we see those things  
**[0:22:14-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:14):**  side by side is because we're hearing from the farmers themselves, all these different  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:17):**  companies are coming at them, they don't know how to do due diligence on them, they don't  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:20):**  know how to sort through the companies themselves, like Danone and Anheuser-Busch, you know,  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:24):**  they're seeing kind of different opportunities come at them. So to conduct that due diligence  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:27):**  on the ag technology, but we're specific because the companies that were interested in that  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:32):**  space are directly tied to soil health. So how can an ag tech company that we may be  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:37):**  talking to on the equity side work with the farmers that we have on the debt side? And  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:42):**  how can we talk about, you know, there are different examples of algae, where algae,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:47):**  you know, companies that are developing technology through algae that's restoring soil health  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:51):**  is breaking that chemical dependence that the soil has. So there's so many different  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:22:55):**  opportunities. And we see so many synergies kind of across that, you know, equity to the  
**[0:23:00-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:00):**  farm level side.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:01):**  So we're going to talk about the farm loans in just a second. But I'm just interested  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:04):**  to sort of drill into that agri tech, you know, to a greater extent, and whether you're  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:08):**  able to give any any sort of specific examples about the type of thing that you mean? Is  
**[0:23:12-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:12):**  it sort of, you know, things that monitor soil carbon or collect data? Or is it things  
**[0:23:18-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:18):**  like robots that might go out and help with weeding? What sort of things are you thinking  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:21):**  of?  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:22):**  It's across the spectrum, you know, I think for us, it's, you know, we we are not going  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:28):**  to necessarily say this is what we think is best. But as we work with farmers in our network  
**[0:23:33-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:33):**  to be able to go to the farmers and say, is this something you would use, you know, because  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:36):**  I may think that they would use it or Dave may think that they would use it and the farmer  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:40):**  might look at us and be like, you guys are crazy. We're not going to use this. So it's  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:44):**  that it's that ability to sort of do a focus group or test across the acreage that we have.  
**[0:23:50-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:50):**  So you know, the answer is yes to those ag tech solutions that are really getting at  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:23:57):**  this intersection of soil health and climate. So if there is technology that can facilitate  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:03):**  and expedite the building of soil health, and if that is, you know, in some kind of  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:08):**  cover cropping way or some kind of weeding way that enables us to break that dependency  
**[0:24:13-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:13):**  on the chemical ag system that yes, you know, in terms of ag technology, but there are a  
**[0:24:18-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:18):**  million ways that it can go because as you touched on, you know, as the carbon market  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:21):**  continues to gel, you know, I think we're still a few years out from the actual mechanics  
**[0:24:26-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:26):**  of that and the metrics of that. But you know, in terms of capturing carbon in soil and measuring  
**[0:24:31-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:31):**  carbon in soil, that data, those metrics are incredibly powerful. And the same goes for  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:37):**  water. I mean, my bias is actually towards water. I think the water conversation is absolutely  
**[0:24:42-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:42):**  critical. So the ag technology that we can be using and deploying around water sensors  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:47):**  and infiltration and conservation and the way that we think about water, especially  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:51):**  as we deal with almond growers in places like the Central Valley and California. So it's  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:24:56):**  really that, you know, I think that the field of ag tech as we see it today, 10 years from  
**[0:25:01-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:01):**  now is going to be defined in so many different tiers and so many different ways as it continues  
**[0:25:07-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:07):**  to emerge.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:08):**  I wonder if you have any sense of how big the average loan is likely to be. What sort  
**[0:25:12-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:12):**  of scale of farm are you talking about?  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:14):**  You know, it's interesting. So, you know, Danone, for example, sent us a list of 10  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:19):**  farmers that they were hoping to sort of restructure their loans. Those 10 farmers alone carried  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:25):**  $289 million in debt. So, you know, if we wanted to, that could be the whole first fund.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:30):**  We don't want the first fund to only be for one partner, but it sort of speaks to the  
**[0:25:34-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:34):**  scope and scale and size of the problem, which is also the size of the opportunity. So for  
**[0:25:40-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:40):**  us, you know, what we see is the ability to do this at scale and with alacrity. So the  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:46):**  urgency around the work, around soil health and as it relates to climate for us is huge.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:51):**  All of us are parents. We see the enormity of the task at hand and also the opportunity.  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:55):**  So for us, it's to work with these multinational companies so that we can do this quickly and  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:25:59):**  at scale. But then, you know, to me, and I think it's because I am named after a farmer  
**[0:26:05-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:05):**  that runs a small farm, you know, we can't we don't we that's a place of privilege to  
**[0:26:11-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:11):**  say, oh, we're only going to work with the large scale farmers. We need to be working  
**[0:26:14-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:14):**  with all of them. So we are in the process right now as these smaller farms come in,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:19):**  you know, contacting us through the site and other means to figure out how we can create  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:23):**  opportunities and bundles and loans that work with all farmers. So we're in the process  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:28):**  of actually collecting that data right now as it comes in to understand, you know, if  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:33):**  there's a farmer in Washington state who has 500 acres and is looking to transition to certified  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:39):**  organic, what are the needs there? So we're really in a data collecting mode right now  
**[0:26:43-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:43):**  and all of that.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:44):**  And it seemed earlier on that you were indicating that, you know, you're starting in the US,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:48):**  you're being disciplined, but potentially if the fund goes well and you feel like you're  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:52):**  making a difference and you're able to scale those solutions, that perhaps there is an  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:26:56):**  intention to move outside of the US in due course?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:00):**  I mean, you know, as a dual citizen with New Zealand, I would love that because, you know,  
**[0:27:03-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:03):**  we see and we hear consistently from farmers in Australia that are really in this climate  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:07):**  crisis, especially as it relates to water. We've heard from farmers in Pakistan, India,  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:12):**  you know, just around the world, Europe, of course. For us, we are not territorial because  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:17):**  there is not time. There is not time to have that mindset of scarcity. So, you know, as  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:23):**  we have these conversations, you know, our goal is you can open source this. We can show  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:27):**  exactly what we're doing. We can demonstrate it because clearly the scale of the debt problem  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:32):**  for farmers around the world is massive. And replant is not of the mindset that this is  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:36):**  ours to solve alone. What we hope to create is an industry that thinks about capital differently,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:42):**  that services farms differently. And so where we're tying our loans to soil health, what's  
**[0:27:47-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:47):**  to say that the next company that emerges can come in and say, you know what, let's think about  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:51):**  capital as it's tied to the United Nations sustainability goals. And the more that this  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:27:55):**  organization or this farm hits those goals, then the lower the cost of capital. Some of the farmers  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:00):**  that we're in conversations with, they're B Corp certified. So what would it look like for a  
**[0:28:04-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:04):**  financial services firm to come in and say, you know what, we're going to work with B Corp  
**[0:28:07-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:07):**  certified farmers. So there's enormous opportunity to think about capital in this collaborative,  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:12):**  creative way. And that's what we're modeling and that's our invitation to others to come in beside  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:18):**  us and help grow the industry. So you talked about the importance of soil health metrics there. And  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:23):**  that kind of brings us on to the repayments because that's one of the sort of interesting  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:26):**  and unique elements that was talked about in Forbes magazine recently, the way in which you're  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:30):**  planning to tie the interest rates with the success, for example, that farmers have in  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:36):**  boosting soil carbon levels. Right, that's right. So that's where these third party technical  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:41):**  assistance partners come in, because, you know, for that to have validity, we can't be doing that  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:45):**  ourselves. It has to be independently verified. So we work with different partners, you know, again,  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:49):**  depending on the crop type, depending on the region, depending on the soil type and figure  
**[0:28:53-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:53):**  out what those metrics should be. So if it's water conservation on a dairy farm in Ohio,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:28:58):**  if it's carbon sequestration, if it's soil organic matter, to determine at the start of the loan,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:03):**  what those metrics are going to be. And then a huge part of the loan package is that guaranteed  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:10):**  buyer. So we're bringing in this third, you know, the multinational food company as a guaranteed  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:15):**  buyer so that the farmer has that buyer guaranteed for offtake at the end of the three year conversion.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:21):**  So as we looked at it, we thought, you know, how do you actually offer capital that helps mitigate  
**[0:29:27-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:27):**  the risk for the farmer as he steps into the conversion? Because it is a three year process.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:31):**  So, you know, it's not something that we can figure out in year one. However, what we are  
**[0:29:37-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:37):**  seeing is if there's a farmer, for example, like one of the growers that we know in Indiana,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:41):**  and he was converting his farmland from conventional soybeans and conventional corn,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:46):**  he had 7000 acres. And as he stepped into regenerative agriculture in that first year,  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:51):**  just the reduction of chemical inputs saved him half a million dollars. So, you know, again, it's  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:29:57):**  recognizing this is not going to be one size fits all. And as we work with dairy farmers and a  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:03):**  company like Denone with dairy, or we work with Anheuser-Busch and barley and rice growers to  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:08):**  really sit down and figure out what are the terms of that loan that work with the barley growers and  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:14):**  the metrics for soil health on a barley farm as we capture them. So that's Don's experience as CEO  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:20):**  of RSF Social Finance. He was able to really creatively create integrated capital metrics  
**[0:30:26-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:26):**  and loans and terms that allowed him to meet the needs of the specific organization that he was  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:32):**  working with. So we're bringing that skill set to replant. So do you find, are you planning that  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:38):**  the interest rates will actually change, that you'll be rewarding success? That's the goal.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:43):**  Yes, that's the goal. So the stronger the metrics are on soil health, the lower the cost of capital.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:48):**  Really interesting to hear what you're saying about using different metrics for different farms,  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:53):**  you know, based on a whole range of different elements in terms of what they're trying to  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:30:57):**  deliver, what you're trying to get them to deliver. And I'm wondering in terms of assessing that  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:02):**  baseline data, how many metrics you're sort of starting from? Is there a suite of 20 or 30  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:08):**  metrics that you kind of got to begin with that you then start to narrow down or to prioritize?  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:14):**  Or is there, you know, it's just, you know, there are three or four key metrics and those are the  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:18):**  ones that you're starting from? You know, that's a great question. And I think those metrics, again,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:23):**  if you think about soil as a database, you could have hundreds of metrics if you wanted to,  
**[0:31:28-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:28):**  you know. So for us, it's not to try not to pre-determine what those should be.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:35):**  Are there sort of checks and balances in there to make sure that there isn't too much  
**[0:31:39-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:39):**  emphasis on any single metric so that you're not driving unintended consequences?  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:44):**  Yes, exactly. And I mean, I think that's exactly the critical issue, I think, and is to be mindful  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:50):**  of unintended consequences and the ability to pivot as needed if those start to arise. So,  
**[0:31:57-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:31:57):**  you know, again, I think it's, you know, for us, it requires radical transparency.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:01):**  And with ag technology, there is a transparency that we can bring to farming. Like you touched  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:06):**  on with drone technology, I mean, they're all different ways to capture this data. Again,  
**[0:32:10-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:10):**  you know, what is the farmer going to engage with? What is he actually going to use? That's,  
**[0:32:15-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:15):**  you know, that's a big part of the conversation. And with some of the different ag tech companies  
**[0:32:19-0:32:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:19):**  that we've we've spoken to, I mean, one of the first questions I'll ask them is, do you have  
**[0:32:22-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:22):**  a farmer on your board? You know, because you can raise millions of dollars and have an idea that  
**[0:32:27-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:27):**  you think is absolutely brilliant on paper, but if it's not going to be deployed on the farm,  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:31):**  it's a waste of everybody's time and resources. So again, for us, it's having the farmer at the  
**[0:32:36-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:36):**  centre of these conversations. For too long, the farmer was sidelined and treated as just a servant  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:41):**  in the process. Robin, it's been so interesting talking to you. That's all we've got time for.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regenerative-finance-The-one-with-Robyn-OBrien-entud5#t=0:32:46):**  I'd like to thank my guest Robin O'Brien, the co-founder of replant capital. You can find out

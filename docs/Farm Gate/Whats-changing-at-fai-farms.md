### Farm Gate  (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 14:08:35)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finn Logue-Kustein.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:08):**  FAI Farms has worked with global food brands to embed sustainability at the heart of their  
**[0:00:13-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:13):**  supply chains for more than 20 years.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:16):**  Ever since I first came across the company in 2006, I've had a huge amount of respect  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:21):**  for the company itself and its objectives, and for the people behind the name.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:25):**  And while campaigning NGOs can wish things were different and advocate for change, FAI  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:31):**  can and has been working with big companies to help them understand the challenges of  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:35):**  sustainability and to drive change throughout their businesses.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:39):**  As we look forward to a future disrupted by global warming, biodiversity loss, population  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:46):**  growth, widespread social and financial inequity, increasing antibiotic resistance and of course  
**[0:00:50-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:50):**  pandemic, FAI's role remains vital.  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:54):**  While the FAI brand has remained constant, the company itself has existed in different  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:00:59):**  forms, most recently as part of Benchmark Holdings, PLC.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:03):**  Recently that changed again.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:04):**  There's been a management buyout and now Oystein Tawson, previously the company director,  
**[0:01:09-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:09):**  is the new chief executive.  
**[0:01:11-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:11):**  Carly Scott is the new director of sustainable operations.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:15):**  Welcome both.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:16):**  I'd like to start with just asking you to go into a bit of background for me.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:21):**  What is FAI Farms and why is it so important, do you think?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:25):**  Hi Finlay, thanks so much.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:27):**  So FAI originally stood for the Food Animal Initiative.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:31):**  We were founded in 2000 by Ruth Leighton, Roland Bonney and Malcolm Pi.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:35):**  These three had a vision really to create an equitable and sustainable food system.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:41):**  And our work is grounded really in bringing both practical experience and scientific expertise  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:47):**  to bring about new solutions to some of the challenges that we have within our supply  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:52):**  chain.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:53):**  And when we talk about those challenges, what we're looking to do is create food systems  
**[0:01:56-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:56):**  really that are always considering the three E's.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:01:59):**  So sustainably economically, sustainable in terms of environment and also sustainable  
**[0:02:04-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:04):**  from an ethics perspective as well.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:06):**  So considering both animal welfare and human ethics.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:10):**  And we've worked with all levels of the supply chain for many years now, from farmers and  
**[0:02:15-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:15):**  producers to food processors and suppliers and right up to food service providers and  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:21):**  retailers coming up with new solutions for how to develop a more sustainable supply base.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:26):**  It's interesting that you mentioned the way that FAI Farms really began as an outfit that  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:32):**  was particularly interested in embedding good farm animal welfare outcomes into the supply  
**[0:02:36-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:36):**  chain.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:37):**  And it's broadened that out so that it's much more about sustainability in the round.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:42):**  Are you able just to sort of briefly describe for me what the link is between farm animal  
**[0:02:46-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:46):**  welfare and overall sustainability?  
**[0:02:49-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:49):**  I think animal welfare sits right at the heart, I think, of a sustainable food system.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:02:55):**  In some ways, it's a bit of a litmus test of what is acceptable, what appeals to consumers,  
**[0:03:02-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:02):**  what sits right with producers.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:05):**  It's also one of those areas that I think a lot of sustainability frameworks leave out.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:11):**  The people, planet, profit type approaches leave out the animals.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:16):**  Those are a critical aspect of many of our food chains.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:20):**  And that's why we've always talked about ethics, ethics being the guiding light of how we treat  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:25):**  both people but also the animals that we depend on.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:29):**  So why is it, do you think, that FAI Farms and the role that it has is so important?  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:34):**  It seems to me that there's quite a unique element about the way that FAI works and the  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:39):**  way that it's almost an interface between society and society's wants and demands and  
**[0:03:46-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:46):**  businesses themselves.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:48):**  But it does this in a technical, scientifically robust way, which is sometimes lacking from  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:53):**  NGO, you know, we want a better world sort of narrative.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:03:58):**  We try to do three things at the same time.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:01):**  So we are purpose driven, we're driven people, we believe in a better food system, higher  
**[0:04:07-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:07):**  welfare regenerative practices, and we want to push that.  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:11):**  But we're also at the same time science based and science driven.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:16):**  And we have scientists on our staff, we deploy the scientific method in everything we do.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:22):**  We're hyper focused on data and analyzing data and understanding the insight that the  
**[0:04:28-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:28):**  data can tell us.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:30):**  And then finally, we're client focused, we're client driven.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:33):**  We want to make sure that we always help, you know, solve the problems that our clients  
**[0:04:38-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:38):**  have and deliver business value to them.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:40):**  So yeah, we are different in the sense that we're trying to hold those three purposes,  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:45):**  if you like, at the same time.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:48):**  And that generates a sort of continuous internal dialogue of what is right.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:55):**  And how do you balance those three things?  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:04:57):**  And how do you unapologetically do all those three things at the same time?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:02):**  And Farmgate, this podcast itself is part of that dialogue.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:06):**  It's you know, partly an internal dialogue that's spilling over into the outside world  
**[0:05:10-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:10):**  as well.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:11):**  Where Farmwell and FAI Farms together are producing this podcast and hoping that the  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:16):**  conversations that we have together, where we're reaching out and talking to people that  
**[0:05:20-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:20):**  we're interested in, are then of interest to the wider world as well.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:23):**  So that's a bit about FAI Farms, where it came from, why it's important, its role within  
**[0:05:29-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:29):**  the world.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:30):**  So you've gone through this management buyout, this MBO process.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:35):**  How did that come about?  
**[0:05:36-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:36):**  And where are you going now?  
**[0:05:38-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:38):**  What's next?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:39):**  We're really taking control of our own destiny with this process.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:44):**  Having been part of a bigger group for many years, we now have the opportunity to take  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:49):**  the company forward into a new era, a new chapter, making sure that the people who do  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:05:55):**  the work and who love the work are also now the ones that own and run that business.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:01):**  Through the process of setting ourselves up again, we've built an excellent new management  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:07):**  team.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:08):**  We have really done the hard thinking around, you know, how do we build on the legacy that  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:13):**  we have of our sort of charismatic founders, as well as create a new path for ourselves  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:20):**  in terms of both how we want to operate internally, how we want to make decisions, as well as  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:26):**  how we, you know, how we kind of express that into the wider world.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:30):**  And Kali, what do you think the central mission of FAI will be going forward now that you  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:36):**  have this new independence where you can kind of set the trajectory for FAI's future yourselves?  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:43):**  You've got that new team together.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:45):**  You yourself have stepped up.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:46):**  You're now the director of sustainable operations.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:49):**  You know, it's a really big role.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:50):**  What's going to be central to your mission?  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:52):**  Our mission now, we sort of frame as practical solutions for climate and food security.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:06:57):**  And I think whilst we feel that much of the work that we've done in the past will continue  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:01):**  to carry on our focus and our way of working across the supply chain and using that balance  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:07):**  of practical strategic thinking and scientific understanding will continue.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:12):**  What is changing, I think, is the pressures that we're under globally and the focus that  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:15):**  we have as a society on where we're going in the future.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:19):**  So it's really using this opportunity to bring more kind of pace and reach to the work that  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:24):**  we'll be doing and bringing new ideas to the forum on solutions in order to achieve that  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:29):**  for our future, really, for stabilizing the climate, repairing biodiversity and bringing  
**[0:07:33-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:33):**  food security and equitable supply chains.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:36):**  There's one shift that we, you know, that we see and that we want to help drive, which  
**[0:07:42-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:42):**  I think this opportunity helps us do, is that mindset shift from maybe sustainability to  
**[0:07:50-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:50):**  regeneration, if you like.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:52):**  That's something that we're passionately involved with both on our own farm, but also obviously  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:07:57):**  something that we've discussed many times on Farmgate and other forums.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:02):**  Essentially how do we become a force to sort of help businesses, farmers go through that  
**[0:08:07-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:07):**  mindset change of thinking about not just doing less bad when we produce food, but actually  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:12):**  generating goods and doing good through that process, which is really embodied in that  
**[0:08:18-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:18):**  term regenerative food production.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:21):**  So that's a really laudable mission.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:22):**  But there, Carly, you referred to some really big ambitions there.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:27):**  And Oystone has sort of locked that up in this transition from sustainability and, you  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:32):**  know, there are many definitions of what that is, and then to regeneration, which is something  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:36):**  I think, although again, there are lots of definitions, I think we can all agree that  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:41):**  it's something which is more dynamic about the change that's being embedded.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:46):**  You talked about individual farmers right up to big companies.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:51):**  And so I think it might be helpful for listeners if you could just kind of give us an idea  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:08:55):**  of who some of your clients are, because I said at the beginning, the changes that you  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:00):**  make, the changes that FAI embeds are big because you work with big names.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:06):**  And that presumably then somehow trickles down from those big name brands to the producers  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:11):**  that are working and supplying them.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:13):**  Yeah, I think it's fair to say that our impact is definitely through our clients.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:18):**  Since the very beginning, we've worked with McDonald's in the UK at the global level.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:24):**  We've had a very long lasting relationship with Marks and Spencer's in the UK.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:30):**  And from that, we've also we've expanded into packaged goods companies, chocolate companies,  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:36):**  variety of different retailers and food producers.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:40):**  But it's a big role call, isn't it?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:42):**  When you've got Nestle, Unilever, Ferrero, I mean, lots of big names you've got you guys  
**[0:09:47-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:47):**  have got some influence.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:49):**  True.  
**[0:09:50-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:50):**  And that is where our that's where our impact is.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:52):**  So I think where we're different is obviously we can't tell anybody what to do.  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:09:57):**  We don't have any coercive power, if you like.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:01):**  And I think that's where it goes back to those three kind of goals I talked about earlier  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:05):**  is how do we how do we inspire our clients to do the right things, to make the changes  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:10):**  that we think and the science would tell us are the necessary changes and really inspire,  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:17):**  you know, inspire that mindset in that is an area that we keep coming back to.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:22):**  How do we how do we get people to really commit to this themselves as opposed to doing it?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:27):**  Because they're being told to do it or they're being pressured by by external groups.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:31):**  I think that's where that's where our role is a bit different.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:34):**  We are we are trying to work with those big companies to help them see in a see the opportunity  
**[0:10:40-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:40):**  and see the reasons to do the right thing.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:42):**  And Carly, you were, I think, a brand manager in the past.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:46):**  And now you've stepped up your experience, therefore, is really important in terms of  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:50):**  understanding the nuts and bolts of the day to day of how you influence an organisation,  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:55):**  the sort of relationship that it's important to build up with them so that they they trust  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:10:59):**  you enough when it comes to making some sort of bigger and possibly slightly riskier decisions.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:04):**  Yeah, I think that's true.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:05):**  And I think one of the most rewarding part really, if the MBO for many of us is that,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:09):**  you know, we as a team will continue working together.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:12):**  We're also working together in partnership with many of these very engaged and motivated  
**[0:11:17-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:17):**  individuals within companies and organisations that we've been working with for many years  
**[0:11:20-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:20):**  that are prepared to make some of these these steps and decisions.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:24):**  And that does take time to build up that level of trust and to bring about those changes.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:28):**  As a company, how do you embed those sort of, you know, those ethical ideas that you're  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:32):**  trying to share with the rest of the world that you're trying to encourage in other companies  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:38):**  and other businesses?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:39):**  How do you embed those within within your own business?  
**[0:11:42-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:42):**  So we're a strong sort of values led company that's been there in the past.  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:45):**  But I think in FAI sort of becoming its own entity, I guess it's given us the opportunity  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:50):**  really to reflect and initiate upon any changes on our internal operations or the way we work  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:56):**  as a business for the future going forward.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:11:58):**  So that would include anything from, you know, our culture as a business, as a team and how  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:03):**  we work together, as well as how we make decisions as a business to shape the wider world that  
**[0:12:07-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:07):**  we're in.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:08):**  I think for me, it starts with having that openness within the within the company and  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:13):**  within the management group, always discussing our values, always discussing our mission,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:19):**  reminding people of why we do what we do and bringing that into the kind of everyday decision  
**[0:12:26-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:26):**  making.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:27):**  So it creates a it creates an open and lively, if you like, and an ongoing dialogue about  
**[0:12:34-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:34):**  what is the right thing to do.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:36):**  And I think trying to hold those three principles in your head at the same time, the purpose  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:41):**  driven, the science led and the client value piece together is what helps guide us.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:47):**  It's not that we have a set of answers that we, you know, we apply in order to be ethical.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:53):**  It's much more an exercise, if you like.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:55):**  It's a practice.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:12:56):**  Boyston, you've written about conscious leadership recently.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:00):**  And I wonder if you could just talk very briefly about what you think the difference is between  
**[0:13:06-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:06):**  a leader and a boss.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:07):**  Yeah.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:08):**  So the concept of conscious leadership is something that it really juxtaposes it against  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:14):**  sort of formal authority and bossiness.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:17):**  So a lot of people might think of bossiness in terms of leadership.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:21):**  So it's it's using formal authority to tell people what to do or coerce people to do a  
**[0:13:27-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:27):**  particular thing.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:28):**  Conscious leadership is more about soliciting that internal motivation in people and clients  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:34):**  in, you know, in stakeholders so that they do the right thing for the right reasons.  
**[0:13:39-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:39):**  So it's really, you know, working.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:42):**  You know, it's a principle that we practice internally.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:45):**  We have participatory kind of decision making.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:48):**  We involve people in the in the decisions that we're making, which means that you have  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:53):**  to you know, you really have to explain why you need to focus on the purpose of why we  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:13:58):**  should make this or that decision in order to solicit that commitment from your from  
**[0:14:03-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:03):**  your colleagues.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:04):**  And that is what we're trying to also practice with our with our clients.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:07):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:08):**  I mean, you talk about you talked earlier on about the fact that, you know, FAI isn't  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:12):**  a food producer.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:13):**  You don't sell food yourselves.  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:14):**  And so as a consultancy business, it is your role to lead and to and to bring your clients  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:21):**  into themselves, into a leadership position, ideally, but to help them to change the way  
**[0:14:26-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:26):**  that they work.  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:27):**  And it sounds like in the same way that you're trying to work outside the organisation, you're  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:31):**  trying to embed a similar process inside the organisation as well, which must be, you know,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:35):**  an exciting environment to work within.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:38):**  And I'm just struck because, you know, we've talked about some of the big names there that  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:42):**  you're working with, whether McDonald's or Nestle, you know, and and there, you know,  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:46):**  there were challenges that NGOs and the media have picked out with those companies and with  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:51):**  many others.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:52):**  So how do you deal as a business that has a very strong ethical foundation when ethical  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:14:58):**  conflicts or contradictions arise between what your own business ethics are and perhaps  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:04):**  what the client's needs or their shareholder needs are and where those appear to be at  
**[0:15:08-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:08):**  odds?  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:09):**  I think that there's always, you know, I think that is the definition of ethics.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:14):**  There's always, you know, there's always, always tension.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:17):**  For us, it starts with the it starts with the motivational, the motivation piece.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:22):**  So we've always said from the very beginning that we work with anybody who's willing to  
**[0:15:27-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:27):**  improve.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:28):**  So it's about the direction of travel.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:30):**  We know very well that everybody can't be at the same point because their starting points  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:35):**  are different.  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:36):**  So there's no point in judging clients or potential clients for where they're at at  
**[0:15:40-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:40):**  this point, as long as we can kind of agree on a on a direction of improvement.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:45):**  So that's that's really where we are at.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:47):**  And I think that's the that is the hard business of change, to be honest.  
**[0:15:51-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:51):**  It's sort of accepting that you're sometimes in an uncomfortable position, but knowing  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:15:57):**  that we are heading in a in a direction that we all agree with and that we believe in.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:03):**  So that's really where we where we start, where we start our work.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:06):**  And a lot of our engagements with clients will will essentially start with that type  
**[0:16:10-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:10):**  of, you know, vision, work.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:11):**  So where are you?  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:12):**  Where do you want to be?  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:13):**  Where are you now?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:14):**  And where do you want to be?  
**[0:16:15-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:15):**  And how do we how do we then get there?  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:17):**  Because to your point earlier, everybody doesn't want to be a leader.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:20):**  A lot of people, a lot of people just want to do better than they're doing now.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:25):**  And that's cool.  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:26):**  Carly, I hear what Oystein says, and that's you know, that's that's the chief executive's  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:30):**  pitch.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:31):**  And I know that you are somebody who in your own life is is very active in in campaigning  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:38):**  on climate change, that it's really important to you.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:40):**  Are there untouchables out there?  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:42):**  Are there companies, do you think that it just that they're kind of too beyond the pale?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:47):**  You can't work with them?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:48):**  That's a really good question.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:49):**  And I think probably one that we we continually have these conversations internally as to  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:54):**  where is the line between, I guess you could say greenwashing and wanting to make that  
**[0:16:58-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:16:58):**  step towards that final vision.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:01):**  And I sort of Toystone's point, really, I think our role really is to stay grounded  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:05):**  in the evidence, stay grounded in the science and help companies find that vision for the  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:09):**  future.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:10):**  But we're also there as a critical friend.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:12):**  And when we feel that a particular project or a line of work that we're working on isn't  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:17):**  going to bring about the necessary changes or it's it's not in the wider greatest interest.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:23):**  We also feel that it's not even in the brand or the partner that we're working with.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:27):**  It's not in their interest either to do projects or work that isn't fulfilling of that greater  
**[0:17:31-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:31):**  sort of mission that we're working to.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:33):**  So there are times when we would push back and say this isn't the right direction to  
**[0:17:37-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:37):**  go in and we feel that this is this is a better route.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:40):**  But our doors effectively remain open for everyone.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:43):**  We want to have that dialogue even when they're difficult conversations.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:45):**  So there's been lots of change over the course of the last few months as you've been going  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:50):**  through the management buyout, but probably quite a lot is also going to remain the same.  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:17:55):**  Is anything really going to change in the short term for the clients in terms of what  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:01):**  they will see or will the services and operations that you provide, will they just essentially  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:06):**  carry on as before?  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:08):**  So it's an immediate there's no changes to the to the way we work with the same team  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:12):**  and the same sort of level and quality of the work that we've always provided.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:16):**  But in the longer term, this is really an opportunity for us to build areas of the business  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:21):**  that we feel have the greatest potential to to bring about change.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:24):**  So we'll be looking to expand the reach and impact of our work, bring new ideas, new collaborations  
**[0:18:29-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:29):**  and new opportunities to the fore to do that.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:32):**  The management buyout itself has been talked about, I guess, for nine or 10 months, but  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:36):**  the hard graft has happened over the last five or six months.  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:40):**  And of course, coincidentally, there's been a pandemic at the same time.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:44):**  Oyston, you are in New York.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:46):**  Murillo, another director, is in Brazil.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:48):**  The rest of you are in the UK.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:50):**  How's that worked?  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:51):**  Yeah, this has been a process almost entirely done virtually.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:18:57):**  So as you say, we have a group of managers who are in Brazil, US, UK and Norway dealing  
**[0:19:05-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:05):**  with obviously the counterpart, which is also in a few different locations.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:12):**  Everything has been done on Zoom.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:15):**  It's a virtual MBO.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:18):**  I think we probably felt it, we felt it a little bit at the at the sort of, you know,  
**[0:19:22-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:22):**  at the signing point where, you know, you maybe were expecting some sort of a celebration,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:27):**  but it happened in the middle of the night.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:29):**  And most people were, you know, in bed with sleeping partners next to them.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:33):**  So there's maybe a little bit of an anticlimactic Zoom experience right there.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:39):**  But I think it's also shown us the opportunity of that of that type of technology.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:44):**  We've really invested in building a community, building a management culture, taking the  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:50):**  time to talk to each other as a group, as individuals.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:54):**  And I have to say it hasn't, sure, it's happened on the screen rather than in a room, but it's  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:19:58):**  been equally as meaningful.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:01):**  And we've managed to create those human connections through honest dialogue and honest conversations,  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:08):**  bringing in a coach with us as well to sort of help facilitate how do you build that kind  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:12):**  of culture and collaboration virtually.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:15):**  And I think we're on a good path.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:17):**  And Carly, there's a degree to which that's sort of the way that FAI has had to work over  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:21):**  the course of the last few years, the last decade or so anyway, that, you know, your  
**[0:20:25-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:25):**  clients are around the world.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:27):**  So actually, it's not that different a way of working.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:30):**  Do you think as we come out of lockdown, as the travel restrictions are eased, do you  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:34):**  think that you're likely to go back to a situation where you're trying to get people in a room  
**[0:20:39-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:39):**  together on a kind of monthly basis?  
**[0:20:42-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:42):**  Or do you think that you'll continue with this virtual approach?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:45):**  Yeah, so I think, you know, we're in the same situation that many companies have been in  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:50):**  working more remotely now.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:51):**  But we're also more familiar with this, as you say, from, you know, how we work as a  
**[0:20:54-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:54):**  team, we're a global based team, and we have partners in the industry and clients all over  
**[0:20:58-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:58):**  the world as well.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:20:59):**  And I feel there's enormous opportunity now for us as a whole society, really, to step  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:04):**  away from some of the practices that we have that are damaging for the environment.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:08):**  There's many ways I think that we can continue to work together collaboratively from a remote  
**[0:21:13-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:13):**  basis.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:14):**  So building that community and that trust between individuals is really possible.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:18):**  And Oistan spoke to a number of the different ways that we do that in our meetings.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:22):**  So with, you know, check ins at the start of meetings, you know, messenger or video  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:26):**  calls that are just for kind of team building purposes, or for short conversations, using  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:31):**  technology more effectively, really, to make sure we continue to connect as a team.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:35):**  I love the idea of those sort of management games.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:38):**  I remember one where it was a trust exercise, you got to stand on a mantelpiece and everybody  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:43):**  catches you when they fall off.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:45):**  When you fall off, I'd love to see that on zoom, that would be an interesting experience.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:50):**  So maybe it's just it's the celebrations that we've got to get right.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:53):**  I think in terms of what you know, what will change.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:21:55):**  I mean, for me personally, I don't hope I go back to the level of travel I did before  
**[0:22:01-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:01):**  COVID.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:02):**  And I think it's, you know, I think what COVID has done is open everybody's eyes to what  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:07):**  like basically any business can be done virtually.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:10):**  So the burden of proof, if you like the making the case for travel has absolutely been been  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:14):**  raised.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:15):**  I think the other part for us is we talked about it earlier, that kind of the need for  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:19):**  the mindset change in order to drive the type of improvements and changes that we believe  
**[0:22:24-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:24):**  in within our services.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:26):**  The one thing that has changed through this process is that we have brought with us a  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:30):**  suite of digital education courses and a team that works on digital education because we  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:37):**  see a critical part of the regenerative shift is the mindset shift and it's the knowledge  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:42):**  that's needed to implement those practices that will you know, the demand for that we  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:46):**  believe will just rise.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:48):**  So that's it.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:49):**  That's a new kind of feather if you like to our hat since the since the MBO and obviously  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:53):**  again with COVID something that's very opportune.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:22:56):**  That was a nice segue towards the end there from the internal to the external back to  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:01):**  regenerative agriculture and in the same way that the management buyout took place under  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:06):**  lockdown and that you've had your own experiences with that.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:09):**  There's also been a long and ongoing debate about food systems and food security linked  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:14):**  into food availability during the lockdown period.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:19):**  Do you think that COVID has told us anything new about food and food systems or has it  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:25):**  simply given us a new lens through which to see things that we already knew before?  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:30):**  I think it's maybe the latter.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:32):**  I think eating and sharing food is such a sort of universal human experience and the  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:37):**  pandemic has really sort of brought the importance of food to light.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:40):**  A lot of people I know are now preparing and sharing meals or even sort of growing food  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:43):**  at home on a daily basis and it's been a real sort of a focus of their days and comfort  
**[0:23:48-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:48):**  in recent months with all of the challenges that have been going on with the pandemic.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:51):**  I feel that the disruption caused to food distribution networks and the normal ways  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:23:57):**  that we access our food has really highlighted the fragility of food systems and the crucial  
**[0:24:02-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:02):**  job that many people growing food and providing our food play.  
**[0:24:05-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:05):**  I would agree it's exposed vulnerabilities in the food system to a new degree and I guess  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:12):**  for our business we also hope that it will have strengthened the appetite for building  
**[0:24:17-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:17):**  resilience and for investing in improvements, whether that is at the farmer level, ensuring  
**[0:24:23-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:23):**  that they can make a proper living through the processing stages and reducing the vulnerabilities  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:31):**  by building in more resilience.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:33):**  One of the things that seems to have shown to me is the importance of diversity, that  
**[0:24:36-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:36):**  just putting all of your eggs into the retailer basket just isn't good enough and there's  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:42):**  been a real shift back towards more community-based food.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:46):**  I mean you alluded to that, Carly, but also sort of village shops or smaller shops in  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:51):**  towns and farm shops and people have actually sought this out and I think not least because  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:24:56):**  with lots of people on furlough they've had time at home to actually do some cooking,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:00):**  which has been quite new and quite unique for a lot of people.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:03):**  They've not had the time in their lives to experiment with stuff and so that's probably  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:07):**  been really beneficial as well.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:09):**  I think the coronavirus pandemic and the challenges that we're in has given many people the opportunity  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:15):**  to reassess their day-to-day lives and their priorities and I think there is an increasing  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:20):**  interest really in where our food comes from, the transparency of our food supply chains  
**[0:25:25-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:25):**  and that element of community as well.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:27):**  Many people who were self-isolating or restricted at home were dependent on neighbours and local  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:32):**  shops and services to be able to support them through that time.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:35):**  There's definitely, I'd agree with you, a need really for the resilience of our food  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:39):**  systems going forward to maintain that diversity of how we source our food and how we grow  
**[0:25:45-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:45):**  our food and part of that I think is local-based or community-based supply chains I would say.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:51):**  And we're doing a piece of work right now founded by the San Calpa organisation with  
**[0:25:55-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:25:55):**  Cultivate Oxford which is looking at how we use the latest digital tools available to  
**[0:26:02-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:02):**  support community-led supply chains going forward so that they are able to play this  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:06):**  continuing role in an efficient and effective way to provide produce to our society going  
**[0:26:11-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:11):**  forward.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:12):**  So we're coming towards the end and I just wonder if I can ask you this final question  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:15):**  really about the buyout because you've gone from an organisation which was a very friendly  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:21):**  organisation where people did work together in a very constructive way but the structure  
**[0:26:26-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:26):**  that you have now is much flatter.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:29):**  You've got a lot of directors and there's an old phrase, too many cooks spoil the broth.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:35):**  You've got a lot of cooks, how do you make sure that the broth still tastes good?  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:38):**  I think that's a really interesting point because I think a lot of the maybe more traditional  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:43):**  feedback we've had during the process of the MBO is that a group of seven of us is a really  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:48):**  large team to be sort of guiding the business forward and that thinking that perhaps a larger  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:52):**  group brings more complexity and creates challenges in decision making.  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:26:56):**  But I think actually for us we find that the opposite logic is in fact true.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:00):**  The global challenges that we're looking to contribute solutions to are really complex  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:04):**  and they require such a diversity of thinking and expertise and creativity to solve them.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:09):**  And our team of seven, in addition to the wider FAI team, we sort of look to embrace  
**[0:27:13-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:13):**  and celebrate that diversity and difference of opinion and it's through creating a culture  
**[0:27:19-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:19):**  and ways of working that allow us to communicate effectively and connect effectively and build  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:24):**  trust in each other that actually is a strength for us.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:28):**  That's a really positive note to end on.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:30):**  So I will, I'll end there.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:31):**  I'd like to thank my guests, Oystein Tawson, FAI's new chief executive and Carly Scott,  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-changing-at-FAI-Farms-ejc2tv#t=0:27:36):**  the FAI director of sustainable operations.

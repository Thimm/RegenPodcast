### Farm Gate  (2019-11-22)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to FarmGate, where we root out practical solutions for climate and food security.  In this programme, I'm asking the question, how can farm vets contribute to sustainability?  There's an increasing awareness that farm animal welfare, while important in itself,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:00:25):**  is also a critical indicator of environmental progress on farms. Good welfare, it seems,  goes hand in hand with improved environmental performance. It's extremely difficult to  achieve good environmental outcomes while continuing to keep farm animals in the most  
**[0:00:41-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:00:41):**  intensive farm systems. These rely heavily on high-protein feeds, which are often produced  in biodiversity-poor arable monocultures, on high levels of fossil fuel and water use,  and on routine medications, including human-critical antibiotics. I'll be talking to Laura Higham,  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:01:01):**  a veterinary consultant from FAI Farms, who coordinates a new group called VetSustain,  and Simon Docherty, the Senior Vice President of the British Veterinary Association, about  the BVA's new policy on sustainable animal agriculture. I'm talking to Laura Higham,  
**[0:01:20-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:01:20):**  who's a veterinary consultant at FAI Farms, based in Oxford. So, sustainability can mean  many things to many people, Laura. What does it mean in terms of agriculture?  So, sustainability for us means equal consideration of the environment, the economics and the  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:01:40):**  ethics of food animal production. So, within ethics, we consider both the human social  dimensions of sustainability, but also the animal welfare dimensions of sustainability.  And that last one is really crucial because in many traditional definitions of sustainability,  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:01:57):**  animal welfare isn't always included. Laura said that a One Health veterinary approach  considers economics and the environment alongside ethical considerations, such as the impact  on animals and people. She also said that just as the environment can affect farm animals,  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:02:14):**  the farm animals themselves can affect the environment. I asked her to explain more.  So, animals and the environment are inextricably related. So, according to the One Health concept,  animals, humans and the environment are interconnected in everything they do. So, if we are producing  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:02:34):**  animals in a particular environment, then that will impact the health and welfare of  those animals. And likewise, in reverse, the health of those animals can also interestingly  impact the environment in which they're kept as well. So, environment is an interesting  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:02:50):**  term because we need to think about both the human built environment in which we keep animals,  so that might be animal accommodation. And obviously, animal accommodation is really  critical in terms of how they affect the health and welfare of animals that are kept in them.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:03:05):**  So, for example, having good ventilation, having the right bedding, having the right  amount of space, etc., will impact the wellbeing of those animals and the health and disease  incidence in that collection of animals as well. But if we think about the natural environment,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:03:21):**  which perhaps is a little bit disingenuous because of course, when we're talking about  domesticated farm animals, the natural environment in which we keep them is often being manipulated  and adapted for our own needs. But if we're thinking about the extensive systems such  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:03:38):**  as ruminant production systems in the UK, the features of that particular environment,  so I'm thinking about the weather systems, the topography, the natural features of the  landscape, all of those aspects will impact the health and welfare of those animals. And  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:03:55):**  a good example is that with climate change, we're seeing an increase in the incidence  of liver fluke in the west of the UK, because the intermediate host of the liver fluke is  the mud snail, which thrives very well in wet, buggy environments, such as on buggy  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:04:13):**  river banks and in poached land. And so, we're seeing with climate change an increase in  inclement weather and an increase in the incidence of this particular disease, which is obviously  something that we have to double down on in the years to come, potentially through looking  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:04:31):**  at the environment and interventions like cordoning off riparian areas.  And presumably that's integrating those environmental interventions with a really strong health  plan.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:04:43):**  Exactly. And I think this is where vets can have a really strong role actually, is integrating  some of these environmental aspects into herd health planning, which traditionally may have  been implemented by some vets, but I think it's an aspect of health planning that we  
**[0:04:59-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:04:59):**  really need to capitalise upon and integrate into our working lives and advice to farmers.  Simon Dougherty is the Senior Vice President of the British Veterinary Association. I wanted  to find out more about the role of vets in delivering sustainability. But first, I asked  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:05:17):**  him to explain the difference between farm animal welfare and farm animal health.  In the past, there would have been a much greater focus on health. We would have been  called out to see cows, sick cows or cows with mastitis or calves with pneumonia. And  
**[0:05:36-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:05:36):**  we were very much thinking about the health aspects. And I think really the profession  has taken a big change in direction and is very much more about embracing welfare alongside  health and ultimately helping to work with farmers in terms of improving health, improving  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:05:59):**  welfare and ultimately then having a knock-on effect at improving productivity.  We can have good health within a herd or a flock, but not necessarily have good welfare.  So welfare is looking at the overall wellbeing of the animal. The consumer is certainly expecting  
**[0:06:18-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:06:18):**  an awful lot more. And I think for us as a profession, we're looking now at providing  leadership.  You mentioned leadership there. How does farm animal welfare fit into sustainability? And  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:06:32):**  I know that the BVA has got a new sustainability policy. And so perhaps you could flesh that  out for me and help me understand what role vets play in delivering sustainability.  Sure. BVA recognised that, again, as vets and as leaders, we had a really key role to  
**[0:06:52-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:06:52):**  play in developing leadership around sustainability. And we very much kind of wanted to look at  and acquire welfare and set it into that whole sustainability picture.  So we're looking at, again, refining. We talked about mutilation, so things like field docking  
**[0:07:12-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:07:12):**  and pigs. We're looking even at fin-nipping in intensive aquaculture systems, which is  where they, again, we get an abnormal behaviour of the fish nipping each other's fins. We're  looking at aspects in relation to broiler production. So in fact, can we get a more  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:07:36):**  welfare-friendly product that is still economically sustainable by perhaps reducing growth rates  slightly? Can we look at things like free-range egg systems?  And actually, when you look over the last five to 10 years, the trends towards organic  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:07:55):**  and the trends towards free-range production rather than barn systems and so on, we've  seen a huge change in public perception. I'm back with Laura Higham from FAI Farms.  Laura, you work with the BVA. Could you tell me, just to pull out two or three things that  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:08:13):**  you think are particularly important from the BVA's new sustainability policy?  Yes, the BVA Sustainable Agriculture Policy is a brilliant position from the BVA, laying  out how the vet profession can get more involved in developing sustainable agriculture practices  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:08:31):**  on the ground. And it actually includes 13 recommendations for the profession. And just  a few examples of those recommendations. One of them would be that animal welfare is a  key component of sustainability. Also, amongst its recommendations states that we should  
**[0:08:47-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:08:47):**  be aiming to reduce our ecological footprint of food production. And that is by really  boosting certain aspects of agriculture, such as biodiversity and the environment. So it's  looking as well as food production and animal welfare, but also looking at the environmental  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:09:05):**  dimensions. So that's really about linking climate change  and biodiversity restoration together and saying you can't look at one without looking  at the other. Absolutely. And it doesn't explicitly state,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:09:16):**  but it does potentially allude to the fact we should be thinking about regenerative agriculture,  which again has a real One Health feel to it by looking at all aspects in food production.  Which brings us quite neatly to your new role. So in addition to your work at FAI, you're  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:09:32):**  also the coordinator of a new organisation called VetSustain.  That's right. So VetSustain, we've established basically as a group a collective of vet and  surgeons and veterinary nurses from across the profession. And we've recently come together  
**[0:09:45-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:09:45):**  to really champion sustainability within and across the profession. Recognising really  that we already do a huge amount in terms of sustainability in our day-to-day work,  but we're not necessarily seen as agents of sustainability in the public, but also that  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:10:03):**  we potentially can do more in our particular niches and within our responsibilities in  the workplace and in the community. It's about leveraging that position to improve our positive  impact on society. How can you change things on the ground? How  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:10:20):**  are you working to deliver that? So it's all work in progress. I must say that  we've literally been established in the last two weeks. And so we're pretty new and we're  developing our programme as we speak. But really our main goals are to inform and inspire  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:10:36):**  the profession to make positive changes in their workplaces. So that might be through  looking at medicine use and the impact on the environment and looking at antimicrobial  resistance. So it's always trying to pull together a practical  
**[0:10:50-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:10:50):**  sort of how to, how to deliver this, how to deliver that and giving people sort of step  by step information. Absolutely. So we're seeking to build a series  of toolkits for the better profession to look at these different key focus areas and to  
**[0:11:05-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:11:05):**  give vets the evidence they need in a very sort of bite-sized resources to help them  to adopt these principles and practices into their working lives. But it's also looking  at a slightly higher level to policy. So one of our major sort of less visible sort of  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:11:24):**  series of activities will be all about trying to embed policies into major institutions,  into universities, into veterinary businesses that really ensure that we're acting in every  way we can to reduce our environmental footprint. Laura Higham, Vet Sustain's website is vetsustain.org  
**[0:11:44-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:11:44):**  or you can find them on Facebook. On Twitter, you can search for at vet underscore sustain.  In recent decades, our knowledge of farm animal welfare science has improved and alongside  this, customers have demanded more food from higher welfare farm systems. At the top end  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:12:03):**  of the market, we've seen an enormous shift towards better welfare and improved sustainability,  more innovation, better marketing and real improvements to the lives of farm animals.  But while the top end of the market has innovated and been duly rewarded by customers, change  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:12:22):**  from the bottom has been much more difficult to deliver. I asked the BVA's Simon Doherty  why. I think there will always be early adopters and where incentives are put in place, you  will get early adopters changing to new systems and recognising the benefits of changing to  
**[0:12:38-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:12:38):**  new systems. You then have a sweep of legislation coming in behind which will help to really  bring the sort of late comers, if you like, the laggards to the table and improve the  standards and remove some of those old systems. I mean, recently there's been quite a lot  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:12:58):**  of talk about welfare outcomes and I think that's a really important part. A lot of our  farms now are covered in all sorts of fancy technology and fancy devices for measuring  things and I think there's an awful lot more we can do with those devices that are measuring  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:13:17):**  things. A lot of those devices, whether it's wearable devices on cows or video technology  and things like that, a lot of them are focused on improving things like nutrition and improving  health. I think there's an awful lot more we can be doing with that data around improving  
**[0:13:35-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:13:35):**  welfare and looking at the activity of animals and pens and how those provide as indicators  of different health parameters. So looking certainly at welfare inputs is one thing and  that's very much where the five welfare needs are really thinking about what an animal needs,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:13:56):**  but actually looking at the outcomes and so things that we can measure in relation to  animal welfare. Because as soon as we start measuring that, we can start benchmarking,  we can start setting targets and we can start really raising that bar. And I think that's  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:14:12):**  going to be a really exciting area of farm animal welfare in the next period of time.  Toby And when we're talking about inputs and outcomes,  I know that there's an ongoing, there's a live discussion about whether there should  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:14:26):**  be greater priority put on inputs or whether it should be on outcomes. And it's interesting  to hear what you're saying, Simon, that perhaps the balance is shifting because of the technology  and the data that's out there. That when it comes to things like dust bathing, it's quite  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:14:41):**  difficult without physically getting in there with chickens to know whether they are doing  dust bathing or not. And so traditionally we've looked at stocking density and we said  with a lower stocking density, it's easier to assume that these things are happening  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:14:57):**  and then we can go and check on them. But do you think that with technology we'll be  in a position where we don't need to have stocking density necessarily as a proxy. We  can measure that in and of itself, but we'll actually be able to use technology and data  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:15:10):**  to pick up some of that information. Simon Yeah. And I think some of that is already  coming. You know, I've seen some, you know, in my role before I was at BVA, I was involved  with providing consultancy to the Department for International Trade and I had the opportunity  
**[0:15:25-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:15:25):**  to see a lot of this new technology that's being developed both for health and welfare.  I mean, certainly a few years ago there was a, you know, a bit of a look at sort of video  technology and, you know, video technology looking down on a group of pigs. The algorithms  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:15:39):**  now picking up data from video technology can decide whether, you know, a pig is lying  or standing or feeding. It can decide whether even the tail position of a pig is up or down  and give a predictive value for the likelihood of an outbreak of tail biting within a group  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:16:01):**  of pigs. So some of this technology is actually moving very, very quickly. Certainly in the  past, you know, for us to try and do analysis of, you know, 40,000 birds in a poultry house  was incredibly difficult and we couldn't put wearable devices on 40,000 birds in a poultry  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:16:19):**  house. But actually some of the video technology that's now becoming available are picking  up individual birds and looking at patterns of movement and even looking at sort of very  basic level in a free range system, how many of the birds actually go outside and how many  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:16:36):**  of them just stay inside even if they have a choice to go outside. You know, all of that  is really useful information for us, you know, for us to work on. And I think, you know,  as I say, I really think that there's, you know, an exciting few years ahead.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:16:58):**  I'm back with Laura Higham. Laura, Simon talked about the importance of outcome measures,  but he also talked about the importance of technology and data. Is sustainability and  delivering those outcome measures linked to sustainability all about high-tech monitoring?  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:17:14):**  Not necessarily, but it certainly can play a really important part. So we know that the  collection of outcome measures can be quite laborious for farmers, for vets, for other  actors in the supply chain, because it can be a manual process and we can't get away,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:17:28):**  I think, for some measures being manually collected, but we can definitely leverage  technologies to monitor aspects such as animal behavior and link those to technology and  data systems to allow us to expedite the collection of that information and also process and analyse  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:17:48):**  that data more efficiently. And finally, Laura, you've talked about recently  in an article that you wrote about the need to move beyond the five freedoms and adopt  the principle in terms of farm animal welfare of a life worth living. Now, many people listening  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:18:01):**  probably aren't familiar with the five freedoms. Could you tell us what they are and why they're  no longer good enough? The five freedoms were first developed following  the Bramble report in the 1970s. And they state that we should be ensuring that we keep  
**[0:18:16-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:18:16):**  animals free from hunger and thirst, free from discomfort, free from pain, injury and  disease, free to express normal behaviours and free from fear and distress. And actually,  I think they're still very relevant today, just as much as they were back in the 70s.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:18:34):**  And they're very clear and easy for everyone to understand. And so because the five freedoms  of animal welfare focus on an absence of negative aspects of animal welfare, we do need to move  towards a more positive view of welfare, aiming for, as proposed by the Farm Animal Welfare  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:18:51):**  Committee, providing a life worth living for animals. And more recently, still they proposed  aiming for a good life for all animals. So what's the difference? Give me an example  of where the five freedoms kind of stop and where the good life begins.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:19:07):**  Well, it's all around, really, in my view, it's around the behavioural aspect of animal  welfare. So you'll notice that the five freedoms did include a freedom to express normal behaviours.  And in terms of the good life for animals, it's really making sure that we're acting  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:19:24):**  on that particular aspect, because it really has been something that's been potentially  neglected in recent decades, certainly to some production systems.  So are we going to see the end of farrowing crates in Britain and perhaps South stores  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:19:39):**  around the world?  It's a really good question. I personally, personally, the way the way citizens are thinking  and the way the consumer markets are changing, I believe that we will see an end to those  
**[0:19:50-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:19:50):**  particular systems, potentially in a decade, maybe 20 years. I think it will be slow to  change because of the infrastructure investments that those systems necessitate. And I think  the government will always be very protective of farmers in that way, making sure that they're  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:20:06):**  getting some revenue from those systems that they've invested in. I do believe the way  things are going, similarly to the traditional battery cage for laying hens, they will be  phased out, I'm quite sure, in the coming years.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:20:22):**  And just finally, you work with different retailers and business clients. How do you  think it works? Is it the citizen that pushes hard and persuades retailers to make the changes  that you're talking about there? Or does it come from the other direction? Does it come  
**[0:20:40-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:20:40):**  from organisations like FAI and the BVA? Does it come from the retailers? Who's pulling  who in the right direction?  It's a really good question. Actually, it's one that I mull over on a regular basis because  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:20:52):**  I'm still quite sure, to be honest, it comes from both ends and I'm never quite sure which  one is the stronger force. But I do think it comes from both ends. I think we're seeing  a really interesting swell in citizen expectation from farm animal systems of production, at  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:21:09):**  the moment with a real focus on the environmental impacts of food production, but also on the  welfare aspects too. Saying that, I think it's a relatively small contingent of citizens  that shout loudly on these aspects. And also, obviously, we have NGO voices in there as  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:21:26):**  well and that's really important. But we also have some really important progressive initiatives  that are being spearheaded at the other end of the supply chain by retailers, by food  service businesses, and sometimes by suppliers and other intermediaries in the supply chain.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:21:42):**  And so there's some real standout organisations and companies that have really driven major  changes in farm animal production systems, be it environmental standards or farm animal  welfare, through small pieces of research, I suppose, that really demonstrate the win-win  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:21:59):**  solutions for the environment, for animal welfare, and also for production. And that's  really great to see. There are lots of examples of that. For example, the McDonald's UK Poultry  and Natural Environments project that was run alongside FAI that showed that the provision  
**[0:22:14-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:22:14):**  of canopy cover, so trees on the range for free-range birds, actually improved mortality  rates, it improved the quality of the eggs. And obviously, as well as those welfare and  production benefits, it has some major impact on the environment as well through carbon  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:22:30):**  sequestration, biodiversity, building soil health, etc. So there's some really nice  initiatives that are being certainly spearheaded by the other end of the supply chain too.  Well, the cock-raw says that that's all we've got time for. But let me try to summarise.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:22:47):**  In a progressive society, good farm animal welfare is an important end in itself. We  should recognise animal sentience and the importance of the five freedoms, but we need  to move further and faster. We should act to build positive welfare models, which not  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:23:03):**  only avoid negative factors, but also provide opportunities for animals to have positive  experiences, such as the ability to perform their natural behaviours, enjoy fresh air  and daylight, and experience the joy of living as an individual, not just as a member of  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:23:19):**  a herd or flock. But good farm animal welfare is also essential if we're to deliver in-the-round  environmental progress. Genuine sustainability must take account of environmental, social  and economic dimensions, meaning that a transition away from the most intensive farm systems  
**[0:23:38-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Farm-vets--food-sustainability-e94n7k#t=0:23:38):**  is essential if we're to both keep global warming below two degrees centigrade and rebuild  biodiversity.

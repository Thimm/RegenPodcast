### Farm Gate  (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 14:17:12)
**[0:00:00-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farm Gate, I'm Finnlow Kestane. White Oak Pastures is a 152-year-old family  
**[0:00:12-0:00:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:12):**  farm in Bluffton, Georgia, USA. Like most other farms, White Oak Pastures took the chemical,  
**[0:00:18-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:18):**  industrialising route after the Second World War. For example, using nitrogen fertilisers  
**[0:00:23-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:23):**  that made the grass grow, but which degraded the microbial life that underpins natural  
**[0:00:29-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:29):**  soil fertility. In 1995, the fourth generation took over. Will Harris began the transition  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:36):**  away from industrial agricultural techniques and started redesigning his farm as a living  
**[0:00:41-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:41):**  ecosystem. The success at White Oak Pastures has been celebrated globally and Will Harris  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:48):**  is my guest on Farm Gate today. Hello Will, welcome to the programme. Hello Finnlow, thank  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:54):**  you for having me on today, hope you're doing well. Could I start by, you know, just, it's a simple  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:00:59):**  question, I'm sure you get asked this a lot, but could you describe your farm now? What  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:03):**  does White Oak Pastures look like today and how is it different from the way that it looked  
**[0:01:07-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:07):**  in 1995? Well, it's quite different. Today the farm is polyculture. We pasture raised  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:16):**  five different red meat species, cows, hogs, sheep, goats, rabbits, and we hand butcher  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:23):**  them here on the farm. The pasture raised five poultry species, chickens, turkeys, geese,  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:28):**  skinnies, ducks. We hand butcher them here on the farm. We raised pastured eggs, pastured  
**[0:01:34-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:34):**  vegetables, honey, I mean organic vegetables, honey. The farm is 3200 acres here plus another  
**[0:01:43-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:43):**  1425 acres that's a solar array that we graze. We have 176 employees, so that's today. 25  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:01:53):**  years ago it was about 1000 acres of land, monoculture of only cattle, probably four  
**[0:02:00-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:00):**  employees. So it's from an economic impact perspective from a species, in every sense of  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:09):**  the word it's a very different operation. You know, one of the things that strikes me there is  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:12):**  that it's not just about rearing the cattle now. You've got the whole thing on the site  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:18):**  that you're on, the rearing through to slaughter, to processing, to retail, and you know the  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:24):**  shops and all the paraphernalia that go around with that. I mean it's now, it's a huge business  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:29):**  where before it was a farm. Well it's still a farm but closing cycles is very important  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:35):**  to us. You know the way I farmed previously, very linear, very scalable, this is very cyclical.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:42):**  And when you were growing up, clearly you worked within the conventional system, you  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:47):**  know learning your trade from your father. And I think it was around 1995 that you decided  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:52):**  to take what was at that time a perfectly profit making conventional cattle farm business  
**[0:02:59-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:02:59):**  and put it $7.5 million into debt. Now what convinced you that it was reasonable to take  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:06):**  that kind of risk? I did learn how to raise cattle from my father. It was a very linear  
**[0:03:11-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:11):**  industrial commodity cattleman and very good at it and as you said was very successful.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:17):**  I went to the University of Georgia, I majored in animal science. I came home in 1976 and  
**[0:03:22-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:22):**  further industrialized what was already a very industrial cattle operation. I ran it  
**[0:03:28-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:28):**  that way for 20 years. After 20 years of operating in that manner, I started enjoying it less  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:36):**  because I had become increasingly aware of the unintended consequences of that farming  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:42):**  system. The impact on the land and the animals in the community were unintended consequences,  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:49):**  they were unwanted consequences and it caused me to want to move away from that production  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:54):**  model. In what way did you become aware of it? It started out with me as an animal welfare  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:03:59):**  issue that was kind of the kit canary in the coal mine, raising calves, loading them up  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:06):**  on a truck, 100 calves on a truck. The ones two-story, two level truck, the ones that  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:12):**  were urinating and defecating and the ones on the bottom driven 30 hours to a very different  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:17):**  ecosystem or something I just didn't like. I'd done it for 20 years and it hadn't bothered  
**[0:04:22-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:22):**  me but I started to just not like it and so I started moving away from that model. I then  
**[0:04:28-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:28):**  gave up chemical fertilizers, pesticides, on my land and then later and in the case  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:37):**  of the land and the animals, we studied the system and made very conscious decisions about  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:44):**  how to change the way we were managing. In the case of the community, it was really a  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:49):**  pleasant unintended consequence. The community benefited. I should tell you that I mentioned  
**[0:04:54-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:04:54):**  we got 176 employees. We have a payroll of $100,000 a week, $100,000 per week in one  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:02):**  of the poorest counties in one of the poorest states. The economic impact has been significant.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:08):**  There are lots of other cattlemen around you, across Georgia, across the USA, who have started  
**[0:05:14-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:14):**  feeling frustrated with the conventional system, have started noticing the animal welfare issues,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:20):**  perhaps have started even seeing the degradation in the soil for themselves but actually taking  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:24):**  that decision. One day, waking up, having thought about it for however many months and  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:29):**  say, okay, yeah, I'm going to do this. I'm going to make this decision. I'm going to  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:34):**  put this farm into debt. I'm going to put my family at risk. I'm going to put my legacy  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:39):**  at risk here. That's a really big decision and I'm just wondering what it is about you,  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:44):**  Bill, that's different from the other farmers around you. First of all, let me put everything  
**[0:05:50-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:50):**  you said is true, but it was much more gradual than the way you described it. In 1995, I  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:05:56):**  didn't formulate a grand plan to be what we are today. It was not that way. I just started  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:03):**  moving away from practices I did not like and embracing practices that I do like. So  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:09):**  I'm going to be clear on that. To answer the question about the motivation, I think that  
**[0:06:14-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:14):**  probably I became aware of the unintended consequences more than my neighbors because  
**[0:06:20-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:20):**  I probably was more of an abuser of the tools. I probably used more herbicide, more insecticide,  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:29):**  more chemical fertilizer, probably more hormone implants in the cattle, more self therapeutic  
**[0:06:35-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:35):**  antibiotics and onisols. If you drink one glass of bourbon every night, you'll probably  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:44):**  be fine. If you drink a quart of bourbon every night, you'll see the negative parts of alcohol.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:51):**  And I was probably an abuser of those industrial tools. I don't think I'm more sensitive than  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:06:57):**  my neighbors. I think I probably was more of an abuser than my neighbors.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:00):**  Obviously as you go forward through that process, after 1995, changing gradually the practices  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:06):**  that you were involved in, you'll have noticed, I imagine pretty quickly, that there was a  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:11):**  reduction in costs as you were reducing the inputs that you were putting on the land there.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:17):**  But I'm wondering to what extent that helped to provide the capital for the investments  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:23):**  that were to come, whether you had to raise additional capital and really what the first  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:28):**  big investment on the farm was after you'd started moving down that more agro-ecological  
**[0:07:33-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:33):**  road.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:34):**  Well, no, no, you've got one thing wrong there. Changing to this way of farming is not a cost  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:39):**  savings. It's true, you spend less on inputs, but your output falls way below what it had  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:47):**  been previously. Science did not give us those tools to add cost to production. They gave  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:52):**  us those tools to take cost out of production. So I made less money after I started doing  
**[0:07:59-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:07:59):**  without the inputs than I did previously because while I was spending less, my production was  
**[0:08:05-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:05):**  far less. So not only did it not help fund the additional improvements that we made here,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:13):**  it was a drag on what I'd done previously. We were making less money. And in fact, take  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:20):**  that a step further, a farmer cannot give up these tools, these production tools, and  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:26):**  continue to market into the commodity market. You will go broke. It will not work because  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:31):**  you're adding value to the product that the commodity market will not let you extract  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:36):**  back. So if you decide to change your production model to one that's kinder and gentler for  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:42):**  the land and animals and community, you've also got to market your products differently.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:47):**  That involves building a brand, finding a customer base that's accepting of it and willing  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:08:53):**  to pay something of a premium to cover the added cost of production. It also involves  
**[0:09:00-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:00):**  being able to move the product into a monetizable product. Consumers don't buy cows and hogs  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:08):**  and sheep. They buy beef and pork and lamb. So being able to monetize it is essential.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:14):**  So when you talk about the way that you were putting cost into the business, I take it  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:19):**  that that was because as those inputs reduced, as your productivity reduced, you were still  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:25):**  trying to sell into the commodity market. And so what you found was that you needed  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:30):**  you were changing one side of the seesaw but not the other. And so you had to not only  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:35):**  reduce the inputs and change the quality of that product, but also take on that retailing  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:41):**  and processing in order to make business sense of everything.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:44):**  That's well said. That's exactly right. And so what was the first thing that you did?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:49):**  You talked about building a brand there. Was that the first thing that came along or did  
**[0:09:53-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:53):**  you say, well, you know, actually, in order to be able to do this and to take control  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:09:57):**  of this, we need to build our own slaughterhouse, our own processing facility. What sort of  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:02):**  came first in terms of the big investments? Yeah, good question. So the first thing I  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:08):**  did, and this is what most farmers do, and it's a mistake is I changed the production  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:13):**  model without changing anything else. I gave up chemical fertilizers, pesticides, hormone  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:19):**  implants, so different antibiotics, confinement, feeding of grain, the ruminants, I gave that  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:24):**  up, but continued to market my product into the commodity market. And I had less product  
**[0:10:30-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:30):**  to sell because I had given up those production tools. So it was not working economically  
**[0:10:36-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:36):**  for me. So we started marketing our beef as grass fed beef. At that time it was a monoculture  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:43):**  on the cattle. At the time it was very fortunate. The market for grass fed beef was just starting  
**[0:10:49-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:49):**  to develop and I was using outside slaughter capacity to turn my cows into beef to sell.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:10:56):**  That worked well for a while, but I exhausted the excess capacity of the slaughterhouses  
**[0:11:03-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:03):**  I was using. They only had so much extra slaughter capacity and then they ran out before I got  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:10):**  profitable. They say, you can bring six cows next week. I said, I need to bring 12. I got  
**[0:11:16-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:16):**  12 that are ready and I've got the market to sell the beef from 12. I'm sorry, you can't  
**[0:11:20-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:20):**  bring the six. And at that level, I couldn't make money. So at that, in fact, I was losing  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:25):**  money. So I had to decide either to go back to the commodity model and commodity production,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:31):**  industrial production, or invest in the processing capacity, the slaughter capacity, which is  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:37):**  ultimately the 7.5 million dollars that you referenced. I mentioned also earlier that  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:43):**  we are very focused on closing cycles and being able to slaughter the animals here allowed  
**[0:11:50-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:11:50):**  us to utilize the waste from the animals as fertilizer. We take our plants, generate about  
**[0:12:00-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:00):**  nine tons of what they refer to as packing plant waste per day, five days a week. We  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:08):**  don't pay to have that haul to a landfill. We compost it here on the farm and apply that  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:15):**  compost back to our own land. So it's kind of a closed cycle.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:20):**  Fantastic. So it's circular farming at its best where you're opening that loop and you're  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:25):**  closing at the same time, keeping the waste products, using those waste products on farm.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:30):**  I first came across you, Will, on the fantastic Carbon Cowboys films that have been produced  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:35):**  by Peter Bick. And, you know, they're really exciting to watch. And in that film, you talked  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:41):**  about the way in which when you first started that move away from conventional farming towards  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:47):**  regenerative agriculture and adaptive multi-paddock grazing, you talked about the dark days of  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:53):**  the first year or two. And I'm just wondering if that was connected to that, you know, having  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:12:58):**  changed the production element, still trying to sell into the commodity, trying to wrestle  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:03):**  with that challenge. And I wonder if you could tell me what was the most difficult thing  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:08):**  within those dark days and what it was that pulled you through it rather than sending  
**[0:13:13-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:13):**  you back in the other direction and just thinking, OK, well, hang it all. I'm going to let's  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:17):**  give up with this and go back to the way that we used to do things.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:21):**  Well, sadly, this is not to my credit, but probably naivety had a lot to do with the  
**[0:13:28-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:28):**  decisions we made early on. You know, I had inherited a nice farm from my father, grandfather,  
**[0:13:34-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:34):**  great grandfather, as you mentioned earlier. And I've never borrowed money and we'd always  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:39):**  been profitable. And I simply didn't know that I could get in the economic stress. I've  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:44):**  never been in financial trouble. I didn't know I could get in financial trouble. So  
**[0:13:48-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:48):**  I made the decision based on more what I want to do than economic decision that it probably  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:13:56):**  should have been. And when we borrowed the money, built the plant, and we still weren't  
**[0:14:01-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:01):**  able to make money initially, which is not unusual, getting a new business going is always  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:08):**  difficult with cash flow. But the answer is that after I borrowed the money and built  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:13):**  the building, there was no going back. There would have been no market for the failed facility  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:20):**  I built. So I simply had to make it work. And again, the timing was such that we were  
**[0:14:26-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:26):**  able to do that. I don't know that we could do it today. I fear the economic conditions  
**[0:14:31-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:31):**  have changed so much that we probably did all that in a sweet spot. If we'd been 10  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:38):**  years earlier, I know we would not have survived. If we'd been 10 years later, I'm not sure  
**[0:14:44-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:44):**  we would have.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:45):**  The southern states of the United States of America, they're kind of synonymous with family,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:51):**  family values. And I was at university in Memphis, Tennessee. And one of my memories  
**[0:14:56-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:14:56):**  from there is how important family was to everybody. I just wonder how important your  
**[0:15:03-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:03):**  family was at that time. You would have felt that you were potentially dragging your family  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:11):**  into a dark place, just as you were yourself. How important were they in holding you up  
**[0:15:15-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:15):**  and getting you through and making that business work?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:18):**  Certainly, family could not be more important. There's no way I can express that. As far  
**[0:15:26-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:26):**  as the support from my family, they never really knew the situation. My father had dementia.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:33):**  He died of Alzheimer's. He was not aware of what was going on on the farm economically.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:43):**  My wife was raising my family. She's a professional school teacher. She's never been heavily involved  
**[0:15:49-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:49):**  in the business. And my children, two of which are helping me run the business today, they  
**[0:15:57-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:15:57):**  were young. So they didn't know either. So family was not an essential element in the  
**[0:16:05-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:05):**  decisions we made either to get into this or the struggles to improve it.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:12):**  So again, two of my three children do work here full time now, as do their spouses, all  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:20):**  four of them in management. And they've been very instrumental over the last 10 years or  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:26):**  so, instrumental in making the business a success.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:30):**  You mentioned that your father had dementia at the time that you were making the transition.  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:35):**  And I'm just wondering, your father had been a successful cattleman himself. He'd been  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:40):**  running the farm himself for presumably decades. If your father was aware of the changes that  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:46):**  you were making and the struggles that you were going through, what do you think he'd  
**[0:16:50-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:50):**  have said to you?  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:51):**  Well, he simply would not have let me do it. It was just as simple as that. He was very  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:16:55):**  much in control until he was not in control anymore. So his word would have been the law  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:01):**  and he would not have had it. He was very adverse. I doubt my father would borrow the  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:07):**  penny in his life. A child of the Depression, he was successful and just didn't believe  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:13):**  in borrowing money. But I do think a lot about what would he say today. And I think he would  
**[0:17:19-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:19):**  be very pleased with everything we've done, except for the fact that we still have operating  
**[0:17:26-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:26):**  on borrowing money. We still have bank debt. We make debt service every month, but he would  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:32):**  not like that. I have no idea what he would say, but some of them would be real good and  
**[0:17:38-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:38):**  some of them would be real bad. And the bad part would be loud and least with obscenities.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:47):**  And part of the reason, I guess, that there are still debts associated with this is that  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:51):**  you seem to be constantly investing. You're constantly growing, not just the business,  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:17:56):**  but the positive impact of the business in the community, buying up property and renovating  
**[0:18:02-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:02):**  it for your farm workers. You mentioned you've got 176 employees now and $100,000 pay round.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:11):**  Did you say a week or a month was a week? I mean, you know, just immense. And I wonder  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:18):**  what the positive, what do you think the key sort of positive impacts are on the community  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:22):**  around you of you being successful and taking successful decisions in your business?  
**[0:18:28-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:28):**  Well, the economic impact is very visible. The little town of Bluffton, Georgia sits  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:35):**  right in the middle of my farm. And we've bought a lot of the stores, old storefronts  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:42):**  and vacant lots and houses there. And it has gone from a ghost town, literally a ghost  
**[0:18:48-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:48):**  town, to a thriving, tiny little village. It's just tiny, it's 100 people. But it's  
**[0:18:55-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:18:55):**  just very, very nice. It's a destination. People come there to be there. So that's been  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:01):**  very pleasing. And again, that was an unintended consequence that went well.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:07):**  I'm just going to move on now. I'd like to focus a little bit on the welfare or the environmental  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:12):**  impacts, the positive impacts of your change. What do you think the key benefits are of  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:18):**  the changes that you've made?  
**[0:19:19-0:19:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:19):**  So of the three basic tenets of White Oak Pastures, the three things that we strive  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:25):**  for is butter and butter animal welfare, butter and butter rechargeable land management practices,  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:32):**  and more and more enrichment of this rural community. Those are the three basic tenets.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:37):**  The first one was animal welfare. But today it's not, we're doing butter and butter  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:44):**  every year. But I think we've done about all we can do. We thought what we believed was  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:52):**  good animal welfare, we realized was not good animal welfare. So we changed things. I don't  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:19:57):**  think we're going to get much better at it than we are right now. We will continue to  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:01):**  focus on it. But that's an accomplishment that's more in the rearview mirror. The next  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:06):**  tenet that I embraced, and it's still my passion, is regenerative land management. And that  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:12):**  is truly my passion today. And I guess I think if I have learned some things that I won't  
**[0:20:18-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:18):**  share with others, it has to do with the regenerative land management. It's practices that badly  
**[0:20:26-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:26):**  need implementing in this country, probably all over the world. Great, great damage, great  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:33):**  degradation has been done through the industrial farming methods. And we figured out how to  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:38):**  reverse that. And it's a lot of fun doing it. The changes to the community, as I mentioned  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:46):**  earlier, were unintentional and they're very pleasant. And this should be done, this should  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:51):**  be a white oak pasture re-enriching a bluff to Georgia in every agricultural county in  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:20:57):**  the United States, or two or three of us. And that'll come just naturally if the right  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:04):**  things are doing for the land and the army. One of the things that's a really pleasant,  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:09):**  sort of almost accidental to start with outcome, associated with the regenerative grazing that  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:15):**  you're doing, is carbon sequestration. And clearly, over time that's become a really  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:22):**  important outcome that you've measured and monitored, and that you're making sure that  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:27):**  you're drawing down as much carbon as you can, because it's become so important to the  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:32):**  world. And I'm just wondering how you've gone about analyzing that, how you've gone about  
**[0:21:36-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:36):**  measuring it, whether it's something that you've been monitoring for many years, and  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:40):**  just what kind of data it is that you're pulling together.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:43):**  Thank you for that question. And I want to preface it by saying that we're very proud  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:48):**  of the carbon sequestration that we have done and are continuing to do. But I do want to  
**[0:21:53-0:22:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:21:53):**  warn listeners that I don't want this change in farming method to be all about carbon.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:02):**  It's important. It's very important. But there are so many other benefits that come from  
**[0:22:08-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:08):**  this sort of production practice that we just get bogged down in carbon. So the improvement  
**[0:22:15-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:15):**  to the water, to the oceans, to the groundwater, the oceans, to the community, on and on and  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:25):**  on. Just so many benefits that let's just don't let it be all about carbon. That's number  
**[0:22:30-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:30):**  two. Number two is I really get tired of hearing scientists bicker about how to measure carbon.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:37):**  I mean, I don't know how to measure carbon. I know how to sequester carbon. We figured  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:42):**  it out. They're still figuring out how to measure it. And their schools of thought is  
**[0:22:46-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:46):**  very polarized. And they bicker and quibble all the time. And it really wearies me. I  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:22:54):**  don't need it. I can see the benefit. I can see what my fields look like compared to my  
**[0:23:00-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:00):**  neighbor's field 10 feet away at 50 miles an hour driving down the road. I can go out  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:08):**  and take a spade full of soil and turn it over. And the difference is not quite black  
**[0:23:13-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:13):**  and white, but it's red and very dark green. The land changes color. When there's a big  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:20):**  rainstorm, which we get in the Gulf Coast, the United States quite often, the runoff  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:26):**  from my land, there won't be much runoff. And if it is, it's very clear. Off my neighbors,  
**[0:23:31-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:31):**  it looks like a strawberry milkshake and it's flooding from there. So, you know, carbon  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:38):**  is important. I'm very proud of the fact we sequester carbon. Very proud of the fact we've  
**[0:23:42-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:42):**  got a scientific study, third party, done that shows we sequester carbon. But the argument  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:49):**  is endless on exactly how to measure it.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:52):**  We've got a slightly more practical question here that came in from Twitter from a farmer  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:23:57):**  for you, Will. And it just says, do you know a good way to build topsoil on top of the  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:03):**  soil that you've already got? So for farms that have really shallow soils over bedrock,  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:08):**  you know, where subsoiling isn't really possible, do you have any tips for how to how to create  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:13):**  additional new topsoil?  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:14):**  I think the Soil and Regenerative Farm management applies in both cases. I think we do build  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:20):**  deeper and deeper soil, even as we're changing the subsoil. The changes we're talking about  
**[0:24:25-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:25):**  is cease cultivation, cease use of chemical fertilizers, cease use of pesticides and bring  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:33):**  in animal impact. And the animal impact needs to be high impact, animal impact with a very  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:40):**  long recovery period. And that will build, it will change the subsoil, but it will also  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:47):**  make the topsoil deeper and deeper and deeper. You know, the argument is made that by many  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:53):**  scientists and I disagree with it that you can only improve soil for so long, it reaches  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:24:58):**  a saturation point and it's not going to be any more carbon in that soil. And I do understand  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:03):**  the saturation point. But I think what they fail to understand is the soil will get deeper  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:08):**  and deeper and deeper. We've seen that in our own country where virgin soils were broken  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:14):**  and this topsoil was very, very, very deep and it became more and more shallow as time  
**[0:25:19-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:19):**  went on. Well, the same forces of nature that built that deep topsoil can rebuild that deep  
**[0:25:25-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:25):**  topsoil if we humans will quit doing the things that destroy it.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:29):**  What kind of a recovery time do you have on your own pasture?  
**[0:25:33-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:33):**  That is a highly good question, it's highly situational. In a very brutal environment  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:38):**  like you would find in a desert kind of an area, arid area with not much rainfall, not  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:43):**  much humidity, you may not be able to graze the same land. It may take more than a year.  
**[0:25:50-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:50):**  I'm in the coastal plains of Georgia, 50 something inches of rain a year. And depending on the  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:25:58):**  time of year, six weeks, maybe eight weeks is more than enough recovery time.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:03):**  As a kid, I was a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard and so I was very taken by your description  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:08):**  of yourself as a good old boy. I'm just wondering if you could tell me why you think that more  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:13):**  of the good old boys around you in Georgia don't follow your lead?  
**[0:26:17-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:17):**  Probably because they're good businessmen. The farmers who have survived, I should say  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:23):**  that in my part of the world here, farms have gone from being three, four, five hundred  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:29):**  acres farms to being several thousand acre farms. So it was a survival of the fittest  
**[0:26:35-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:35):**  in terms of who is what farming families have survived through the last 50 years or so.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:43):**  The ones that are out there today are good business people. They didn't get there by  
**[0:26:47-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:47):**  accident. They didn't survive through accidental means. The commodity farming business has  
**[0:26:54-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:26:54):**  become a very low return business, but it's also a much lower risk business. The weather  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:02):**  risk is mitigated somewhat by having bigger and bigger equipment that can be planted and  
**[0:27:08-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:08):**  harvested much more quickly. Irrigation is for droughts, an arsenal of different pesticides  
**[0:27:16-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:16):**  to use in the event of some pest. The government programs that put floors under price drops.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:26):**  The ability to hedge on the commodity board, federally subsidized crop insurance, and go  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:33):**  on and on and on about different tools that have been provided through the economy or  
**[0:27:38-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:38):**  through science that takes risk out of production. None of these people are doing super well  
**[0:27:44-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:44):**  financially because it's a low return, low risk business. But the question was, why are  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:52):**  they not coming in this direction? The answer is, this is a very high risk business. There's  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:27:57):**  a lot that can happen to go wrong in our business model. I'm not an evangelist. I'm not pleading  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:04):**  with people to change the way they farm. I think it would be good if they did. But because  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:09):**  I am a good old boy, I get it. I understand.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:11):**  What do you think other farmers around you think of you? Obviously within your business,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:16):**  the promotion that you do is to an extent, it's sort of setting yourself above in terms  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:22):**  of farm animal welfare, carbon sequestration, environmental outcomes. Do they feel that  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:26):**  the existence of your business is in some way an insult to their own? Or do they just  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:33):**  see you as a businessman that's doing something different?  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:35):**  Well, first of all, I will say this. You said setting myself above them. I don't set myself  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:41):**  above them. I set myself apart from them. There's a very real difference in that. Because  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:47):**  I don't set myself above, but set myself apart, I'd like to think there's not a tremendous  
**[0:28:52-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:28:52):**  amount of animosity from the people who know me. Now, there is a tremendous amount of animosity  
**[0:29:01-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:01):**  on the part of big multinational food companies who really resent people like me, not just  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:09):**  Will Harris, but the people like me who do lift up the negatives of that industrial monocultural  
**[0:29:17-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:17):**  commodity system. And that's a palpable thing, I feel. And it's concerning.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:27):**  For those farmers that you've described as excellent at what they do, working in the  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:32):**  conventional systems who are businessmen, who don't want to take those risks, I wonder  
**[0:29:36-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:36):**  how you think farmers like that might be persuaded to move in the direction that you have. And  
**[0:29:43-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:43):**  there's a new Secretary of Agriculture in Washington. And what would be your message  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:48):**  to him? Well, let me ask what would bring about change.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:51):**  And I'll start out by telling you what will not bring about change. And then I'll tell  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:29:55):**  you what will. What won't bring about change is government regulation, because there are  
**[0:30:01-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:01):**  so many lobbyists with so much money representing the big multinational food companies that  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:07):**  there will not be meaningful change from the government, from Washington, DC. Another thing  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:13):**  it won't be is it won't be big multinational companies who make billions of dollars selling  
**[0:30:19-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:19):**  highly processed food that comes from these monocultural industrial farms. Change won't  
**[0:30:25-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:25):**  come from them. It's like change didn't come from the tobacco companies when cigarettes  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:29):**  were found to be carcinogenic. It won't come from farmers who just say, you know what,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:35):**  I think I will just change what I do because it's the right thing because they can't afford  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:40):**  to. It won't go over two or three other things that people look to that will not cause change.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:45):**  If we have meaningful change, it will be because consumers educate themselves and demand it.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:51):**  Wendell Berry, a role model man, and he says something like consumers vote with their dollars  
**[0:30:59-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:30:59):**  on how they want the world to be. And that's much easier said than done because these consumers  
**[0:31:06-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:31:06):**  are intentionally, hopelessly misled by big, northern national food corporations by green-washed  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:31:13):**  product. This don't change the way we produce food. This just change the way we talk about  
**[0:31:18-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:31:18):**  it. The food labels are so intentionally, intentionally misleading that it's hard for  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:31:25):**  consumers to educate themselves to make the difference that they have to make if they're  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:31:31):**  going to do this. Fantastic. That's really interesting. It's  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Will-Harris-ep62ah#t=0:31:34):**  a great way to end and that's all we got time for. I'd like to thank my guest, Will Harris,

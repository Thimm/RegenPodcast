### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke-Hustain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  of the Food and Global Security Network. This is the third programme in a series in which  I talk to regenerative dairy producers from around the world. The series is part of the  
**[0:00:18-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:00:18):**  Regen Dairy Project, set up by Farmwell and FAI Farms. Through the project, we aim to  define what regenerative dairy looks like, and to engage dairy farmers and food businesses  around a practical vision for a productive and profitable global dairy sector that also  
**[0:00:34-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:00:34):**  restores its relationship with nature. Today, I'm talking to Feliz van Amburg, who farms  at Dahmerle in Sharon Springs, New York, USA, and to Charlotte and Russell Heald from Dunkheld  Farm in the Tararua region of the North Island in New Zealand. Welcome all. Russell, you've  
**[0:00:50-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:00:50):**  told me that your vision is to transform your farm into a food forest for everything. Now,  that sounds fantastic, but what does it mean? I suppose for that it's all about diversity.  That's where the regenerative model comes in. When you think about that regenerative  
**[0:01:07-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:01:07):**  farming model, for me it's all about diversity, so it's creating a life for everything living.  It's almost getting back to farming with nature rather than against it. If we think about  everything that's living within our soils, and all your birds and your bees, and then  
**[0:01:23-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:01:23):**  you've got all your animals, but even all the people that are on the land and around  the land as well. So, for me, the big part is just diversity. Although the product that  you're producing on the farm is dairy, what you're trying to do is to, through the nature  
**[0:01:40-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:01:40):**  that you're revitalising on the farm, is to provide food for everything that lives there,  whether it's a microbe in the soil, or a bird or animal that comes onto the land, as well  as human beings. Yeah, definitely. Phyllis, one of the phrases that stood out for me when  
**[0:01:57-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:01:57):**  we spoke previously was vertical real estate. Now, you said that you saw regenerative agriculture  as an opportunity to build your vertical real estate, so I wonder if you could explain for  us what that term means. Yes, I'd be happy to, and I would love to take full credit for  
**[0:02:12-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:02:12):**  that phrase, but I really ought to give tribute to the late Gerry Brunetti, who talked about  that sort of in depth, rather than, especially in the United States, the old, you know, the  practice of, you know, the last several decades of pushing out hedgerows and working more  
**[0:02:29-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:02:29):**  acres. It's this concept of building density and diversity, and more plant volume, more  ability to capture solar energy and photosynthesis by working on the plant density and the amount  of stuffed food that you can produce above, but you know, also below ground, you know,  
**[0:02:49-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:02:49):**  vertical doesn't have to only be one direction per se, and we can start lower in the soil  life. And then I think that that's also speaks to the way I view regendary in that, you know,  we're working at producing food while we enhance that soil life, and we're enlisting that proliferation  
**[0:03:09-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:03:09):**  of soil life and living organisms above and below ground to produce more nutrient dense  food. You know, we're using biological solutions, you know, rather than chemicals. So we use  community complexity, which talks about again, the biodiversity, but using community complexity  
**[0:03:27-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:03:27):**  and pay in place of herbicides and pesticides, polycultures instead of monocultures, compost,  mulch, litter, manure in place of chemical fertilizers, and establishing healthy catchments.  I was really interested at the beginning of that, that, you know, I'd interpreted what  
**[0:03:45-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:03:45):**  you'd said in terms of vertical real estate as being above ground, but then you're talking  about it below ground as well. So it's taller and deeper. And so your real estate, rather  than having maybe 10 inches of root below the soil and a foot at most of grass above  
**[0:04:03-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:04:03):**  the ground, you're looking at much taller grass and much deeper roots. And within that  real estate, a much greater capacity to build biodiversity and to hold water.  Absolutely. And the density as well, more plant volume packed right in there in a multi-storey  
**[0:04:19-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:04:19):**  level. I don't want to just see one tall crop of corn. I want to see all different age groups  represented of all different classes of plants. And then all of the root structures that reflect  those below ground going as deeply as they can.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:04:34):**  Fantastic. Now Phyllis is in the USA and Russell, you're in New Zealand. And so I just want  to go back to that idea of the food forest and just drill into your sort of understanding,  your own definition, if you like, of what regenerative agriculture is. So what is it  
**[0:04:50-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:04:50):**  for you?  It's encompassing our whole environment. It's thinking about everything within where we  are and like where we live. It includes all the people, it includes all the animals and  
**[0:05:02-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:05:02):**  everything that goes on within our whole environment. And it even like it starts in all the water  cycles and all the soil life and all the plant life and all the trees and everything. It's  just it's one big environment. It's not just a it's not singular at all. I love what Phyllis  
**[0:05:20-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:05:20):**  was saying about that vertical real estate and it's about creating that plant density.  And so that's pretty much similar along the lines of what we're doing with that diversity.  It's all around with our pastures is creating that diversity. So what we call our for our  
**[0:05:36-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:05:36):**  cows, we call it our cow salad. So our cows are able to go into a field or into a paddock  and they're able to select what they want to eat. They're not just being forced into  eating what the farmer wants them to be eating. And then with all the hedgerows and plant  
**[0:05:51-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:05:51):**  diversity around the outside of the paddocks, having more plants and trees in there that  the cows can they can go and nibble on or they can chew on. That's really beneficial  for them health wise. But also it's another fodder source. It's just creating diversity  
**[0:06:05-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:06:05):**  as well as creating shade and shelter. So it's just encompassing that whole environment.  And of course, as they eat from the trees and the hedges around the outside of the paddocks,  they're taking berries and seeds and then they're spreading biodiversity more as well.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:06:20):**  And again, just, you know, kind of back to that idea of the food forest. It seems to  me that at the heart of that is a circularity. You're trying to create circular systems on  your farm. Yeah, definitely. It's getting everything to work together rather than always  
**[0:06:35-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:06:35):**  trying to fight the system and trying to fix something. It's actually working within nature  so that it's actually able to sort itself out without us having to go in and do it for  it. Fabulous. Now, I think before we go any further, we ought to take a moment just to  
**[0:06:50-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:06:50):**  understand a bit more about your individual circumstances. And Charlotte, I wonder if  you could just describe Dunkhold Farm for us. Our farm is in a small Norwegian, well,  a long time ago it was a Norwegian sort of settlement just under the Ruhani Ranges. And  
**[0:07:05-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:07:05):**  we have 194 hectares here. And the main dairy platform is quite flat and the rest of it  sort of rolling hills. And we have around, we're milking around 400 cows at the moment,  we make milk and we just milk them once a day. I heard as Frisian, Jersey cross probably  
**[0:07:25-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:07:25):**  moving a little bit more towards Jersey and A2. We just milk once a day, that was quite  a big change in our system, probably a little bit before we turned to Regen. And we supply  Fonterra Organics. So probably about three to four years into our regenerative farming  
**[0:07:43-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:07:43):**  journey, we decided just to take it another step and to certify organic on our farm as  well. And what's the climate like? Is it, you know, do you have summers and winters  in the way that, you know, I'd understand it in Britain or is it fairly, a fairly flat  
**[0:07:58-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:07:58):**  to the climate throughout the year? Well, yeah, good question. So until about two years  ago, I would have told you that we live in a summer safe area. We don't have any irrigation  or anything. But we had a really big drought about, well, nearly two years ago. And then  
**[0:08:12-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:08:12):**  we've just, we're just coming out of the end of a really long, very wet spring time. So  we've had a few really interesting extremes, but I think that's been kind of worldwide,  you know, interesting weather events. We have really beautiful, warm, like hot summers,  
**[0:08:27-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:08:27):**  probably we kind of comfortably sit here around, I don't know, 20, 25 degrees in the summer  Celsius. And then in the winter, you know, we have a few good frosty starts, we might  get snow settled once a winter, maybe. So we're not really, really cold. But yeah, kind  
**[0:08:45-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:08:45):**  of a little bit in between, I guess. Definitely feel like it's a great climate to farm in.  So just generally speaking, the grass would grow for maybe nine, 10 months of the year?  Pretty much 12 months of the year. Pretty much 12 months?  
**[0:08:57-0:09:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:08:57):**  Yeah. Maybe we can be growing grass, like it depends  sometimes up over the winter months, like it definitely does slow up a bit. But how  we run our system now, and like we run the higher covers and longer rotations, that whole  
**[0:09:10-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:09:10):**  idea of grass grows grass, and it really does work. So through the wintertime, we actually  still are able to grow some grass through the wintertime.  Phyllis, could you tell us a bit about what your setup's like at Darmalee?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:09:24):**  Yes, and I'm so envious of the 12 months of grass growing. The grass grows for about 210  days here, maybe seven months if you really push it, but it's very slow growth for probably  90 days of that. So we really have about 150 day growing season here in the Northeast US.  
**[0:09:48-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:09:48):**  Good rainfall generally, I think 35, 40 inches of rain a year. A lot of that is snow. We  get water Fahrenheit, we get subzero, so well below freezing, 30, 40 degrees below freezing  in the wintertime. But we just expanded our farm about five years ago. We milk, we are  
**[0:10:08-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:10:08):**  tiny dairy. We only milk about 200 cows. We have about 365 mature cows in total. We are  certified grass fed and certified organic.  I don't mean to interrupt Phyllis, but could you just say that again? How many cows do  
**[0:10:25-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:10:25):**  you have?  365 mature cows.  And you were calling that a tiny dairy. I think that's just worth, you know, kind of  
**[0:10:32-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:10:32):**  dwelling on just for a second in terms of a UK or a New Zealand audience. Cause that's  a pretty average size herd, you know, over here.  Yes, well, it's a sizeable grass fed dairy, even in the United States, that's one of the  
**[0:10:47-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:10:47):**  larger grass fed dairies. And I think it probably is close to the limits of a 100% grass fed  dairy given the standard. But the United States has dairies that are tens of thousands or  even hundreds of thousands of cows. So, you know, 200 cows milking is not much for us.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:11:07):**  We do have minuscule, I guess you would have to call them dairies here in New York. New  York is actually the third or fourth, we go back and forth with Pennsylvania dairy state  in the United States. So California and Wisconsin are obviously first, but New York is actually  
**[0:11:25-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:11:25):**  quite a dairy state and we do have quite a number of even much smaller dairies. We have  even some hand milking Amish dairies with milking a dozen cows, but there are many,  many 50, 75 hundred cow dairies in New York. And forgive me because I did interrupt you  
**[0:11:42-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:11:42):**  when you were telling us all of the, you know, really interesting technical information there  that other farmers will be wanting to hear. Yes. So mixed herd, our expansion, we bought  grass fed cows. So, you know, number one selection criteria for increasing our herd was eligibility  
**[0:11:58-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:11:58):**  for certified grass fed and certified organic cows, which left us with a very mixed bag.  There is very few purebred classic genetics in our herd. So very few classic fancy Holsteins,  very few classic jerseys. Those high producers don't generally do well in an outside environment  
**[0:12:19-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:12:19):**  in New York and our cows spend a lot of time outside. So we have a mixed herd. We milk  twice a day. We graze at least 150 days of the year. 60% of their dry matter throughout  the 150 days comes from pasture at a minimum. And that's, that's just per the standard.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:12:38):**  We try to do more than that. And where does it come from? Where does their  feed come from when, you know, the grass isn't growing and you have to supplement it?  Then we, we have separate hay land. We do hay some of our pastures on occasion, but  
**[0:12:52-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:12:52):**  we have separate hay land that we sometimes will grow Sudan grass, even some nurse crops,  which, you know, we either will green manure in. But generally it's perennial hay stands  and maybe a little bit of Sudan grass that we harvest for the cows.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:13:07):**  Fantastic. Well, thanks to all three of you for that overview of your farms. That's really,  really fascinating. But Charlotte, I wonder if we could talk a little bit about mindset  shift, because that's something that we hear a lot about in relation to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:13:21):**  And I wonder, you know, what it means for you, what was it that got you and Russell  into Regen agriculture in the first place? Yeah, that's a really good question. So for  us going to Regen kind of came at a time where we'd been having, you know, like we'd made  
**[0:13:34-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:13:34):**  the change to once a day because we knew that if we were going to stay in the dairy industry,  we had to, we had to get things in balance. And at that point in time, things were really  out of balance for our family. I have a background in health, and we'd started to really explore  
**[0:13:48-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:13:48):**  human health in terms of the food that we ate and looking into the quality of whole  foods and things like that. And so I guess when we started to learn about our own health  a lot more and the food chain, we started to really question the production of food  
**[0:14:02-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:14:02):**  and where it was coming from. And it really made us start to, you know, look at our own  farm and how we were producing food. And I guess for us, it came down to food integrity.  We were like, wow, you know, if we wanted to source this, you know, higher quality whole  
**[0:14:16-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:14:16):**  foods for our family, let's look at how we're doing it, you know, at ground level and see  what we can do here. And then I guess that along with, you know, some of the environmental  challenges and standards that were starting to come up, it just felt like a really, it  
**[0:14:31-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:14:31):**  felt like a really good shift for us. I guess one of the biggest things around mindset that  Russell always says is that because people often, you know, they just can't, they can't  really believe it. And I think it's one of those things you've actually got to get to  
**[0:14:44-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:14:44):**  ground level and visit a regenerative farm so that you can kind of see it to believe  it because we can, we can share the numbers and we can talk about how it is, but until  you actually physically experience what it's like to be on a regenerative farm, see the  
**[0:14:56-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:14:56):**  cows skipping around the paddock and just experience that the good energy and the good  vibes like you can't, it is kind of hard to believe it for some people. So yeah, definitely  see it to believe it. I also think that it's one of those things, if you're interested  
**[0:15:10-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:15:10):**  in finding out more about regenerative agriculture and you've maybe got some hesitations, go  visit a farm, but leave all your previous ideas at the gate, you know, like going with  a really open mind, I guess it's a little different now that we're organic, but you  
**[0:15:24-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:15:24):**  know, just knowing that initially when you go, you know, change into a regenerative system,  you don't throw all your tools away. There's still different things that you can do if  you need to, because the transition period can be, you know, relatively interesting and  
**[0:15:38-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:15:38):**  present lots of new challenges, but yeah, definitely keeping a really open mind and  just exposing yourself to more people and visiting more farms who are doing it. So you  can actually see the results and see the evidence that it's, it can, it can be a way of, a new  
**[0:15:51-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:15:51):**  way of farming for you.  Maybe I can ask you both this, but you know, you talk Charlotte there about the need to  see it to believe it. Now that's difficult on radio, but at the same time, I wonder if  
**[0:16:03-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:16:03):**  you could help us out with, you know, what your farm used to look like before you got  into this mindset. What was it and what's the difference if somebody came onto your  farm today?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:16:14):**  Beforehand, it would have been just like a lot of mono cultures, you know, and we did  some crops in the winter and things like that, but they were, you know, just like one species  as well. And it was just, there was a lot of stress on the farm, like cows, you know,  
**[0:16:27-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:16:27):**  it was animal health stresses, people stresses because it was challenging. But now, like,  for instance, we have, or Russell a few years ago had a guy ring and he was like, I've been  driving past your farm to my lease farm for a couple of years now. Like what's going on  
**[0:16:44-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:16:44):**  there? You know, what are you doing? Because I've just noticed this change. Like he just  said, he'd seen that shift and equally we have people in our community who, who cycle  in the area and they were like, wow, we just really noticed now when we cycle past your  
**[0:16:56-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:16:56):**  farm, it just feels different, you know, like the energy of what's going on is really, you  know, like helpful.  What is it? What is it that they're seeing that's different?  
**[0:17:05-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:17:05):**  Okay, and then they're seeing, so they can feel it because energy is a big thing, right?  But they can also see it. So what we can see now is the diversity through challenging times  in the season, like our farm, catch wood, has even through the drought, you know, it's  
**[0:17:19-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:17:19):**  remained, you know, we've always had some reasonable covers, but it's the diversity.  So you look into a paddock and you're not just seeing ryegrass, you're seeing a whole  different diverse pasture mix. The covers are generally longer, aren't they? And happy  
**[0:17:33-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:17:33):**  cows. And I probably wouldn't have noticed this so much myself before because I wasn't  always on farm, but now it's really noticeable that, you know, the cows, you walk into the  paddock and the cows are just really content, really happy. They're not hungry or looking  
**[0:17:48-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:17:48):**  really stressed. They're just so chilled out. Like the other morning I went and let the  cows in for milking and they all came skipping and jumping through the paddock and they kind  of jogged to the shed because they were so excited and they had back feet in the air.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:18:01):**  You know, I think happy cows is a pretty good indicator of what's going on on farm and equally,  you know, happy people.  Fantastic. I mean, I've been scribbling down notes as you've been talking and I've got,  
**[0:18:12-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:18:12):**  you know, there's a reduction in stress from the staff and from yourselves. There's an  increase in biomass and therefore in nature, an increase in diversity and an increase in  cow happiness. I mean that, you know, that's fantastic stuff. And Phyllis, we've talked  
**[0:18:25-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:18:25):**  about regenerative agriculture in the past and there's, you know, some of those things  that Charlotte and Russell were talking about there, you know, are things that you've said  too. But you've also talked about the ego of dairy farmers and the way in which they  
**[0:18:38-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:18:38):**  have to outperform other aspects of agriculture. And I wonder why it is that you think that  they have to outperform? What is it about dairy farmers and can regenerative agriculture  help to make things easier, perhaps less aggressive, less stressful, less competitive?  
**[0:18:53-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:18:53):**  To answer the last question first, I think if we really, I mean, certainly it's bigger  than just regenerative agriculture because it would need to be embraced by the entire  culture. You know, we would really need to embrace a different view of dairy production  
**[0:19:09-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:19:09):**  to really embrace the fact that, you know, as Charlotte said, we're producing this high  quality food, this nutrient dense food. If you go back to the beginnings of industrial  dairy production, the goal was to produce food on every plate and to make it affordable.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:19:27):**  And I think that one of the difficulties that we have in making a change in dairy is that  it's a high stakes game with a very small margin and it's decoupled from most of the  most of the market pressures that guide the rest of agriculture and frankly, the rest of the,  
**[0:19:45-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:19:45):**  almost any industry. So we don't have this goal of producing high quality food and directing  that towards people. We have dairy farmers that were asked to produce tremendous volumes  of milk on as small a margin as could be accomplished. And the market was constantly,  
**[0:20:06-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:20:06):**  the industry was constantly shifting to take advantage of the next efficiency that each  farmer brought to the table. So the result is you have actually people who are accomplishing  feats that if you brought to the table a hundred years ago and said, we will have cows that will  
**[0:20:27-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:20:27):**  deliver upwards of a hundred pounds of milk per day, per cow in one location enough to feed,  I don't even know how many thousands of people in an industry that is so efficient,  they wouldn't believe you. And so I think that rightfully so the ego portion of that  
**[0:20:47-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:20:47):**  is that these farmers are highly accomplished at what they do.  Mason You talk about the way in which you bring somebody from a hundred years ago and you plunk  them now. It's magic. And what we're talking about is trying to disrupt that magic.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:21:00):**  Jennifer Absolutely. Because we had no idea what the  consequences would be. We had no idea the cost of the externalities in producing that food.  And it's less nutritious. It's there's more water per fat, per protein, per other solids.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:21:17):**  There's short-lived cows. There's cows in confinement. There's imbalances in omega-3,  omega-6 fats, which didn't exist naturally in cow's milk. They normally would be quite close.  The human stressors, the industry stressors, the entire production of that sort of dairy depends  
**[0:21:37-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:21:37):**  on monocultures because we need commodity crops to feed a throughput system instead of,  what regenerative agriculture is attempting to do is remarry the natural environment and  our ecosystem environment that the people live in with the dairy cows that produce our foods.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:21:58):**  Because once we divorce that, once we divorce the cows from the land, we lost so much. And the land  feeds the cows and the cows feed the land. And that's been completely severed at this point.  So the number of externalities that have come into play, they continue to be unaccounted for.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:22:17):**  And I think that dairy farmers today, as I said, the market pressures, they're price takers.  They produce crops like all the crop farmers. They have husbandry skills like the beef producers.  They have management skills. They're managing multimillion dollar businesses.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:22:37):**  All of this on a margin that's razor thin, but they keep competing with themselves and with  others to find the next thing that they don't have to account for in order to meet that demand.  And so they are proficient in so many skills and they're a very difficult group to get through to,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:22:59):**  because so much has to change for them to realize the benefits of regenerative agriculture.  So much of them are intrinsic. And the larger the business, the more difficult it is for them to  rein everything in and become all inclusive with their environment. They still rely on the greater  
**[0:23:21-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:23:21):**  agricultural industry in a lot of ways to sort of bolster their production.  Mason I love this picture that you're painting for us of the magic that has been created,  but now it's about trying to move away from this industrial process of magic and back to working  
**[0:23:38-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:23:38):**  in harmony with nature, the magic of mother nature, so that farmers can become price makers  themselves rather than price takers and create therefore more resilience, both economic and  environmental in their own systems. And in terms of moving, you talked earlier on about the scale  
**[0:23:58-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:23:58):**  of dairy in the United States as opposed to your own farm. Do you think that there is a direction  of travel? Is there a movement where dairy is starting to look at regenerative, where more  farmers in the United States are starting to want to step off the treadmill that they're on, where  
**[0:24:16-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:24:16):**  they're just kind of constantly running to stay ahead of themselves and taking decisions to move  to something else where they're in control themselves?  Bridget I think that there is. I'm hopeful that there will be more opportunities for people to  
**[0:24:32-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:24:32):**  help to splinter the dairy industry. We really need to sort of shatter these larger farms and  give more people the opportunity to work with dairies that can be more interactive with their  environment. I think there are huge opportunities in direct marketing and in small creameries.  
**[0:24:51-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:24:51):**  We just our immediate area, there were dozens of farms within probably a 10-mile radius,  there were dozens and dozens of farms in six small creameries 75 years ago. And maybe something like  that needs to return because the cost of doing business the way we've been running has run its  
**[0:25:12-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:25:12):**  course. And it's no longer really possible to produce milk for the prices that are being given  without subsidies and help and all kinds of other, you know, and in a diversified system. And with a  completely different paradigm, I think that we could certainly maintain the best of both worlds.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:25:31):**  I don't know if there will be a place for the 100-cow fancy Holsteins in those systems  necessarily. But I do think that we don't need to go back to £4,000 either.  Jason And that idea of splintering the industry,  
**[0:25:43-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:25:43):**  we're going to come on to a little bit later because, you know, you in your own way have  managed to splinter the industry in your region. And we'll come to that in due course.  Now, Russell, one of the dangers for regenerative agriculture, and, you know, this is sort of linked  
**[0:25:58-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:25:58):**  back to that conversation we were just having with Phyllis, where you've got, you know, these  great big farms and then you've got, you know, more independent farms, is corporate takeover.  And regenerative agriculture is being talked about more, which means that more companies  
**[0:26:10-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:26:10):**  are interested in developing regenerative brands. Now, this could be a good thing if  the on-the-ground change is genuine, but equally it could lead to over-claiming or a dilution of  regenerative principles. Is that something that concerns you?  
**[0:26:24-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:26:24):**  Russell Yeah, definitely is. Like,  it's like when you start dealing with those big corporates, they're like big beasts, they're like,  all they're worried about is that slim margin and how Phyllis was talking about before, like,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:26:35):**  a lot of those big operators operate on such slim margins and like, as the producers,  we're the ones that get squeezed, not them. So I think it's interesting that you get back to  having all those small factories or small primaries, like, when I start looking forward,  
**[0:26:51-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:26:51):**  that's kind of where it's at. Like, it's narrowing that gap between the farmer and the consumer,  without too many people in the middle, basically taking money away from us. As soon as you get into  that model, we are price takers, and then they're putting that food out to the consumers, but they're  
**[0:27:12-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:27:12):**  also clipping that ticker, pushing that price up. The consumers aren't getting that high quality,  cheaper food, because there's too many people in between the farmer and the consumer making too  much profit.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:27:25):**  Paul So it's the danger for people who are genuinely regenerative farmers like yourselves,  if corporations or, you know, or just even large cooperative companies define for themselves what  regenerative is, and it's a lesser, it's a kind of, you know, a watered down version and then  
**[0:27:43-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:27:43):**  create maybe a certification scheme that associates with that, but they're able to spend  the money on the PR to push that. If you are independent, if you're selling into your own  market, is there still a danger from that kind of approach? Or is it just something that undermines  
**[0:27:59-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:27:59):**  the industry generally?  In New Zealand, it hasn't probably, like corporate takeover and regen is not, I don't feel like it's  something we've really seen so much yet, but the way things are shifting in terms of the government  
**[0:28:12-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:28:12):**  putting a lot of money into researching and science around regenerative farming, you know,  that's, I think that's gonna, you know, it's gonna see a change in that space for sure. But I feel  like it's like everything, you know, we know quite a few regenerative farmers now, and a lot of them  
**[0:28:29-0:28:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:28:29):**  do things quite differently to us, but we're still defining ourselves as regen individually, you  know, so there is more than one way to skin a cat, I guess, and everyone does things a bit  differently. And it's like that in every different facet of an industry, we all have different ways  
**[0:28:42-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:28:42):**  of doing things. But yeah, definitely, I think something probably for us in New Zealand that we  need to be aware of is that as it starts to become more widely known, and the results of what we're  doing are seen, especially in terms of an environmental level with the standards that we're  
**[0:28:57-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:28:57):**  working to achieve and the compliance around that, I think we, you know, there's definitely  potential that there could be that kind of that strong corporate input or not, I wouldn't like to  say takeover, but you know, absolutely, it's something we need to be aware of.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:29:12):**  Toby You were talking about the way in which different regenerative farmers do things  differently, they do things in different ways. And when I think, you know, about organic farming,  and the way that that has become standardised through a certification process, when we think  
**[0:29:29-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:29:29):**  about regenerative, surely part of the beauty of it is that it can be done in different ways,  that it is accessible to a whole range of different farmers, it is a much more ground up  thing. So do you think it's possible to codify this thing in a useful way that companies, for  
**[0:29:46-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:29:46):**  example, you know, like Fonterra would be able to develop a brand that was regenerative that you'd  feel comfortable with? Sarah That's a good question. So Fonterra has branded into what do  they call is it grass fed or pasture raised? I think they might have gone down the pasture raised  
**[0:30:02-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:30:02):**  route, grass feed can be cut and carry. So they went down the pasture raised route in terms of  some of their branding. Yeah, I need to give that question a bit more thought, actually.  Toby I guess one of the things I was thinking around was about your own farm, and the way that  
**[0:30:15-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:30:15):**  you have that sort of conversation with with those people who were, you know, driving past  your farm or walking past your farm, and the people who are drinking the milk that you produce,  you know, how do you demonstrate regeneration? How does regeneration become more than just a word  
**[0:30:31-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:30:31):**  and something that you can measure and show to those people? Yeah, a lot of that comes like,  it gets back to like that whole story that we tell on farm. I suppose for us, we've done a bit  in that space with working with Calm the Farm, which all about enabling farmers and supporting  
**[0:30:50-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:30:50):**  farmers to go down that regenerative pathway. And so, like our farm has been one of the  Pathfinder farms that's been collating all the data and collecting all that and putting putting  that together into a document that they can then take forward to and put to farmers. Calm the Farm  
**[0:31:07-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:31:07):**  was set up as a offshoot of Torha Foundry. So that's the main main one and then Calm the  Farm's under that and they are all about supporting and enabling farmers to go down the  regenerative farming pathway. And so to do that, that put a lot of time and effort into getting  
**[0:31:26-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:31:26):**  farmers that are already on that journey to be able to start working with us in terms of what  it looks like, what things need to change and what things are being put in place. For us, like we go  out and we do our water infiltration testing, our water holding capacity and we do a plant diversity  
**[0:31:43-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:31:43):**  checks over the farm. So we have transit lines through certain paddocks where we will go and  measure plant diversity. And then there's annual soil testing, herbage tests, where we're testing  what's actually coming through into the plant measuring like we've had a quite a good increase  
**[0:32:01-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:32:01):**  in our soil organic matter. So effectively, like we're starting to hold on to more water,  but we're also increasing that water infiltration. So and like for me, that's a really big part  because like water is almost like the next gold. When you talk about water, like water  
**[0:32:17-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:32:17):**  conservation is huge. And if we can get to a point within the regenerative farming systems that we  can start proving more and more of that in terms of what we're holding on to and all that water  hit, like if we have a 100 mil rain event, we're actually able to capture at least 80 or 90% of  
**[0:32:35-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:32:35):**  that rain and utilize it rather than have hit the ground and run off into our waterways carrying  sediment and nutrients with it. So that's a really big part for us. Obviously you're organic as well.  And so you've got the organic certification, lots of metrics being collected there. You're working  
**[0:32:53-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:32:53):**  with Calm the Farm, which is this organization that's working with farmers to help identify  the best regenerative metrics so that there can be a degree of standardization to help both farmers  and customers and throughout that supply chain understand the best metrics. And are you finding  
**[0:33:09-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:33:09):**  regeneration across the vast majority of those metrics? Is everything going up or is there  some things that are doing well and other things that are doing less well?  Yeah, we definitely are noticing improvements in like just in that what we've gone through  
**[0:33:23-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:33:23):**  and done a lot of plant diversity where we've gone around and planted, but then because of how we run  our system, we've got paddocks on our farm now that you'd think that we've gone in and done a  full cultivation and a full seeding of all our multi-species mixes, but it's all been spread  
**[0:33:39-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:33:39):**  through the cows, through our pasture, through our grazing management, because basically your  grazing management dictates what's going to grow well. So just changing that up for us has been a  huge effect. And through the summertime for us, like our cow yard is like a gold mine. It's like  
**[0:33:55-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:33:55):**  you look over and it's all yellow with all the clover seeds and all the plantain and seeds all  over it. So when you see that, you can just imagine what's happening around your farm.  You're getting that natural seed spread through your animals.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:34:10):**  I think that's an amazing image, that idea that it's not just because a herbal lei has been planted  in one place and that you get that salad that you were talking about earlier in that one place,  but because the cows are moving around and they're eating and they're passing these seeds through  
**[0:34:25-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:34:25):**  their system, that you're getting that growth across much broader areas of your farm. That's  fantastic. Now, Phyllis, just coming back to you, cow with calf is important for you in your system,  I know. And while of course that has potentially strong welfare benefits, I don't think that was  
**[0:34:41-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:34:41):**  the key motivation for you in the first place, was it?  No, it wasn't. And again, the late, unfortunately, Gerald Fry was giving us some guidance as we  moved into dairy and he was a retired dairyman, but was then working in beef genetics and just  
**[0:35:00-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:35:00):**  all around cattle improvement. And he said, you'll never get anywhere until you start raising the  calves on their mothers. And we thought, oh my goodness. And of course at the time, everybody  said, you'll go broke. You can't raise calves on cows in a dairy. That's insane. But oddly enough,  
**[0:35:17-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:35:17):**  we had one family cow at the time before we started commercial dairy. And we listened to the  dogma and we bottle raised the calves when we began, but we had this one cow that we had raised  sort of sharing her mother with ourselves for the family milk. So she had basically been raised on  
**[0:35:37-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:35:37):**  her mother. And there was one person that commented, well, it must be because of the breed.  She wasn't really an extraordinary breed. She was a Dutch belt cow, which is just a normal cow breed.  It's got to be a breed thing because she was so much larger, healthier, more vigorous  
**[0:35:55-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:35:55):**  than anything anybody had seen. It was pretty undeniable. And anyway, it didn't take us  much more than a year or two, I think, to start raising the calves on the cows, mostly so that  we could get these very strong long-lived cows. In a grass fed system, we don't have grain. So  
**[0:36:15-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:36:15):**  grain was given to calves to replace milk in the first part. So we just reverse engineered. And  without grain, we brought milk back into the equation just to get the calves and for a long  time, not just milk in the beginning for the colostrum or for the first few weeks, all the way  
**[0:36:32-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:36:32):**  up through sexual maturity, through puberty. Once they're big enough to breed or start having normal  cycles, we don't necessarily breed them that young, but they've finished growing and they get  milked that whole time. So it was generally between six and a half and nine months. We started  
**[0:36:49-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:36:49):**  out with 10 months and that worked very well with the first generation, but they started to grow so  quickly, they really were too fat by 10 months. And we started weaning them a bit earlier.  So yeah, and normally milk would be given, you know, there was articles at the same time we were  
**[0:37:11-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:37:11):**  making this transition, Cornell was writing articles that you could wean calves as early as  four weeks off of milk and raise them on corn. And the disasters that happened when people actually  tried to carry that out were just, they were very sad. But we wanted cows with healthy udders that  
**[0:37:32-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:37:32):**  would live a long time. We weren't interested in sort of the two lactation cows that were,  you know, on the very large dairies commonplace. Another interesting fact from Gerald Fry,  and this would correlate to maturity, between six and nine months in a growing heifer,  
**[0:37:51-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:37:51):**  the cells of the mammary gland are growing four times faster than any other cells in the body.  So she needs the highest nutrition possible during that time in order to develop a healthy udder. So  a healthy udder. So while she's developing in those late stages and coming into maturity,  
**[0:38:09-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:38:09):**  she really needs that unique and very potent nutrition from her mother. And that was really  in a bit selfish because we wanted the best cows we could grow. But yeah, that was why we started  to do it. Talk to me about the importance of epigenetics for you. Epigenetics, I think that  
**[0:38:27-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:38:27):**  this is a very fascinating, it's been, it's a study that's been growing so quickly, I think  even more lately, even in the human aspect, it's become a very, it's a growing topic. And for me,  I've always been interested. So epigenetics are all of the things that we, you know, around the  
**[0:38:46-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:38:46):**  genes that affect the expression and the function of our genotype. So it's more than just genotype  versus phenotype, but things in our environment and experiences from generations previous,  all of those things can impact the functionality. So if we're going to compromise the development  
**[0:39:06-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:39:06):**  of our young stock, you know, if you consider just the idea of epigenetics, we're going to  be influencing not just that cow, but the offspring. And this is, you know, Francis  Pottinger and Pottinger's cats and feeding them cooked and boiled milk, I think, or cooked beef  
**[0:39:24-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:39:24):**  versus raw. And within three generations, the cats were sterile, but it took four generations  for them to return to full health. So it's not just something that we can turn on and off. There  are actual biochemical mechanisms that turn genes on and off. And I really feel as though giving  
**[0:39:44-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:39:44):**  your self, but certainly your cows, the most, the highest level of nutrition has so many,  has far reaching implications that we can't even really know.  And when I was talking to you before, there seemed to be this sort of environmental aspect to it as  
**[0:39:58-0:40:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:39:58):**  well, that the environment that the cows were growing up in was super important. And you were  saying, you know, if the cows moved, you know, moved farm, then you kind of had to start from  scratch again. And this reminds me of the conversation we're having with Charlotte earlier  
**[0:40:12-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:40:12):**  on, where she was talking about, you know, the stress of people being lower, the cow happiness  and the diversity on farm and the nutrition of the land being better through region. And that,  you know, there seems to be a connection between all of these things.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:40:27):**  Absolutely. So and we're still seeing that. So we're year five. We've been purchasing a few  cows and heifers here and there. And we feel like we've sort of started over because we were at such  a point of health in our herd when we had we were previously a 50 cow dairy and we had this  
**[0:40:45-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:40:45):**  generational effect of health, never had an open cow. We could bring in, you know, it didn't matter  if somebody, you know, our neighbour would board heifers with Yoni's disease, which is the largest  boogeyman of all. And we never experienced any difficulties from that. Heel wards, nothing,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:41:03):**  just this exceptional level of health in these cows. And when you move a cow, there's that  initial stress. So there's just the straightforward things that you would know. But as that cow  becomes acclimated to her new environment, not just the weather patterns, but those two  
**[0:41:20-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:41:20):**  and the stressors, but the food so that you buy a cow, she's a mature cow, and her eggs were formed  when she was conceived. So this epigenetic effect starts at that point. So we have a cow who's just  only just becoming acclimated to our farm, we breed that cow. And she has a heifer whose eggs  
**[0:41:44-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:41:44):**  are formed from the cow that was somewhere else. So this heifer is born, raised up, bred, now you  truly have a genome that has had the full experience of the egg formation in utero, growing  to a heifer and then a cow, conceiving a new offspring. And that's the generational effect.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:42:08):**  It takes four generations to really acclimate a cow to a place. And that's when you really see  the fullness of that health and that interconnectedness to place.  Mason It's just so fascinating. And I feel like we could do a whole podcast just talking about  
**[0:42:23-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:42:23):**  epigenetics. But there's other things to talk about. And you've explained that so beautifully,  Phyllis. That's fantastic. Just before we move off the whole cow with calf element,  I need to ask you about the bottom line. The calves are taking quite a lot of your milk.  
**[0:42:38-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:42:38):**  What impact does it have? Is it a negative impact? Or is it all just built into your system?  Phyllis It's absolutely the most economical way to raise your replacements, given the health and  vitality and the utter health, just sheer vigor and absence of any loss of production because of  
**[0:42:59-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:42:59):**  this more fragile creature otherwise. It's absolutely the most economical. But the industry  would have you and all of the people that you speak to would have you think that it's absolutely  the most expensive way to raise a calf because they will convince you that that lost opportunity  
**[0:43:17-0:43:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:43:17):**  cost of all that milk that you could have sent out into the market for a dollar is huge compared to  this very economical set of inputs that you could buy in and feed to your calf. It completely  ignores, as I said, all of the benefits of raising a calf that way. But if you actually think about  
**[0:43:39-0:44:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:43:39):**  it in practical terms, in the actual out-of-pocket cost, it's a very inexpensive way, even so,  to raise a calf because the most potent, dense, highest plane of nutrition you can give a calf  is the milk. The cheapest way to make that milk is to feed the cow to make it. And we don't even  
**[0:44:01-0:44:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:44:01):**  need to feed the cow the type of ration that would push her production all the way up, which is when  you start to see the rate of return start to diminish. You can feed her a very reasonable  diet and in turn grow a calf for just really pennies compared to the value.  
**[0:44:21-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:44:21):**  Thanks so much for that. Charlotte, one of the terms that I heard a lot in New Zealand was  bobby calves, the idea that dairy calves are essentially a waste product usually slaughtered  at four days or so. We were talking about circularity on farm earlier on and in your  
**[0:44:38-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:44:38):**  definition of regenerative dairy, there shouldn't be any waste. So what happens to your male dairy  calves? Yeah, so for a few seasons now, probably coming up maybe four, we just haven't done bobby  calves, so to speak. It's probably more like six years. And so we just decided that we didn't like  
**[0:44:59-0:45:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:44:59):**  the whole bobby calf scheme, which was essentially calves being just a byproduct of the dairy  industry and going to slaughter at about four days of age. It just didn't sit right with us.  And so we decided that there would be no waste on our farm and that everything would have a purpose.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:45:17):**  What we do around that is that we use sexed semen for breeding. So that essentially means that we  pick sexed semen straws for the cows that we want to breed from. And I think this year we've, we  might've had like maybe one or two bull calves, but they're beautiful big bull calves. They'll  
**[0:45:40-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:45:40):**  still be red and they'll still have a purpose. But other than that, anything that we're not breeding  from or our heifers who are having their, you know, their first, coming into their first  lactation, they all have beef breeds put over them. So beef breeds that go on to be able to be  
**[0:45:57-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:45:57):**  fattened for beef and on-sold, that sort of thing.  So it's about changing the genetics to an extent so that those, those calves are able to be reared  for beef.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:46:06):**  Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah.  And is it the same for you, Phyllis, that your, your male calves are reared for beef as well?  Yes, it's the same for us.  
**[0:46:14-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:46:14):**  Phyllis, you talked earlier on about the way that you wanted to sort of splinter  up the dairy industry to an extent. And one of the ways that you've done that is by working  with other dairy farmers in your region to create your own creamery. So you produce milk  
**[0:46:32-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:46:32):**  for Maple Hill creameries, which you help to set up and start from scratch. Why, apart  from that splintering element, why did you choose to set up that new creamery rather  than just supplying into a standard milk pool?  
**[0:46:45-0:47:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:46:45):**  When we began dairying, we saw the treadmill that was commercial dairy and that there really  was very little future for a small farm, that really the impetus was just to bigger and  bigger and bigger. Whenever the debt load got to be too much, you just expanded your  
**[0:47:03-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:47:03):**  herd and started another cycle. Also, again, I'd like to, you know, going back to the whole  idea of the dairy industry was to just provide milk, not any differentiation to all the people.  And that's really the worst thing you can do. There's no sense in marketing anything  
**[0:47:21-0:47:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:47:21):**  if you don't have any differentiation, the worst thing we could do. And there's fascinating  differences historically that have been lost. And I think they're known within the industry.  The fat globules are so large in Jersey milk that that really lends itself to butter.  
**[0:47:36-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:47:36):**  And, you know, a share in Holstein milk, much smaller fat globules and the protein fat ratio  lends itself beautifully to cheese. There's just there's so much opportunity within dairy  production to do so many beautiful things. And that was completely lacking. We figured  
**[0:47:53-0:48:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:47:53):**  we would start with something just a little bit more basic, which is just a little difference  in production, eliminating grain, which levels out that omega three, omega six balance a  little bit. And let's try to market something differently. Let's try to say milk isn't just  
**[0:48:09-0:48:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:48:09):**  milk. So that was why we took on that that venture was to try to bring some new flair  and differentiation into the milk industry. And again, you talked about yourself earlier  as a tiny, tiny producer, but you're one of many producers now producing into Maple Hill  
**[0:48:27-0:48:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:48:27):**  creameries. Yes, that's right. There's about 130 farms now all in New York state that that  send their milk to Maple Hill Creamery. We were very involved in the beginning and set  ourselves on the producer side very quickly. And we've sort of remained there. We don't  
**[0:48:43-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:48:43):**  have any direct involvement in the company itself. But Paul and I both are engaged as  consultants ongoing on 24 seven call for any questions, especially new producers might  have or any difficulty somebody might have. And we still are involved in all of the you  
**[0:49:03-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:49:03):**  might call continuing education, pasture walks and things like that that we do for producers.  And we were just recently involved in procuring a climate smart commodities partnership with  the USDA. And so we'll be helping them head up that interpretation and carrying out that  
**[0:49:23-0:49:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:49:23):**  sort of outreach to the farm at the farm level for them there. Fantastic. Now, there were  going to be farmers listening to this programme who aren't yet regenerative themselves, but  who perhaps feel inspired by the conversation that we've all been having. What advice would  
**[0:49:36-0:49:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:49:36):**  you give to those farmers? How can they reduce the risks to their businesses while still  taking that first step towards system transformation? I think there are more and more ways. Certainly  they're more than welcome to reach out to me. Probably any regenerative farmer would  
**[0:49:54-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:49:54):**  feel the same. I think that I agree with Russell and Charlotte that if you can find someone  to visit with talk to certainly do that. There are so many resources. For me, holistic management  is something that will really set the correct paradigm away from that, you know, the land  
**[0:50:17-0:50:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:50:17):**  grant industrial paradigm really needs to be put on the shelf and a completely different  way of looking at your business. Your agricultural business needs to come into play. And I think  that that's probably the most concise place to look. But there are regenerative organisations  
**[0:50:35-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:50:35):**  worldwide that will all be able to help you. And I would just say, just start looking and  start talking. And Russell, thinking about the future from your perspective, in terms of  ecological security and in terms of public attitudes towards agriculture and dairy production,  
**[0:50:52-0:51:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:50:52):**  do you think that farmers are taking a bigger risk by transitioning to regenerative or by remaining  inside the more traditional farm business paradigm? It's a really good question,  that one, because I think we've almost come to a point where we kind of need to make that  
**[0:51:08-0:51:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:51:08):**  transition and start telling our story in terms of that regenerative model to our consumers,  because it wasn't that many years ago that we didn't have that disconnect between our farmers  and our consumers, because everyone had an uncle or cousin or some sort of family member,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:51:27):**  where like over the holidays, they'd go and stay on the farm. But over the over probably the last  40 or 50 years, there's been a real big disconnect. There's consumers like people in these  big cities that have no idea they can buy their milk from the, like kids think the milk comes  
**[0:51:48-0:52:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:51:48):**  from the fridge at the grocery store. They don't know that milk comes from a cow. Previously,  or like a lot of those kids growing up, they went and stayed on farm. So they knew the process. They  knew what happened with the milk came from the cow and the cow was out in the paddock raising grass.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:52:03):**  And so I think for us, we've kind of got to a point now where we do need to start telling our  story to educate the consumers about what we are actually doing and what we're in some of our  achievements on farm. And how you're able to have such an impact on those externalities that we were  
**[0:52:21-0:52:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:52:21):**  talking about, those public goods, if you like, on how important cattle farming can be and dairy  farming within cattle farming can be in terms of the restoration of nature, the regeneration of  nature that we all need, whether that's in terms of climate or biodiversity or reversing desertification,  
**[0:52:40-0:52:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:52:40):**  increasing transpiration, all these various different things that, and that disconnect,  as you say, it's quite recent, which should give us all hope that we can recreate,  reestablish that connection, perhaps over the next generation. Look, thanks so much, everyone. That's  
**[0:52:56-0:53:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-forests--vertical-real-estate-e1qu25g#t=0:52:56):**  been fabulous. It's been so interesting, but unfortunately that is all we have time for.  I'd like to thank my guests, Charlotte and Russell Heald from Tararua, New Zealand,  and Phyllis Van Amburg from New York state in the USA. RegenDairy is a partnership project for

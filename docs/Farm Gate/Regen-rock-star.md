### Farm Gate  (Wed, 09 Dec 2020 14:55:45)
**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:00):**  Hello. On the Farmgate podcast today, I'm talking to Leontino Balbo Jr. from Sao Paulo.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:11):**  He is a rock star of regenerative farming, a phenomenally successful sugar producer,  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:17):**  an inventor and philosopher. His farm is highly productive, it yields 35% of the world's  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:23):**  organic sugar, sequesters more carbon than it emits, and his land is now one of the most  
**[0:00:28-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:28):**  biodiversity rich areas in the region. He spoke to me from Brazil.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:35):**  Leontino Balbo Jr, we hear constantly that monocultures are bad things, and yet you produce  
**[0:00:43-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:43):**  35% of the world's organic sugar in a monoculture. So what's so different about yours?  
**[0:00:52-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:00:52):**  Monoculture is a relative concept. So after more than three decades without burning, no  
**[0:01:01-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:01:01):**  chemicals, protecting the soil from the UV ray from the sun and soil mobilization, we  
**[0:01:11-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:01:11):**  got back hundreds of different species of spontaneous plants, what they call weed. So  
**[0:01:19-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:01:19):**  in spite of having large areas of cane, we let the cane to coexist with hundreds of different  
**[0:01:29-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:01:29):**  species of weed because the weed or a spontaneous plant, which nowadays we call companion plants,  
**[0:01:37-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:01:37):**  they are the best nature sense to fix or to accompany the plants of the crop. So we do  
**[0:01:46-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:01:46):**  not see the crop itself. We watch the environment as a whole. If you have a stream, if you have  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:01:55):**  a forest, if you have a crop, and if you have people and other vertebrates. So we watch  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:02):**  and we take care about the farm or the environment as a whole. So the first thing, what is different  
**[0:02:10-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:10):**  is the way we fill the environment. It's a change on people's minds. We see the farm  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:18):**  as a way of life and not a way of production.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:23):**  So in fact, if we were looking, if we were flying over your farm and it's 20,000 hectares,  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:29):**  isn't it? It's a big farm. What we would see would look like a monoculture, but what you're  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:35):**  saying is that it isn't. The sugar cane is just one product, one crop amongst a remarkable  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:42):**  diversity of life on the ground.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:44):**  The most important thing that we stop thinking, we quit thinking that the man, the humankind  
**[0:02:52-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:02:52):**  knows how to nourish and to protect the plants. This is two potentials. So in the forest,  
**[0:03:00-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:00):**  who protects and nourish a plant is the soil life, what we call biota, all the fauna and  
**[0:03:08-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:08):**  flora which lives in the soil. So what we learned to do is to feed the soil life and  
**[0:03:17-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:17):**  then the soil life itself takes care about the plants, the crop. And so in a way that  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:25):**  for the first time in history, we have a large scale organic project producing 24% more than  
**[0:03:33-0:03:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:33):**  conventional in some public states.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:35):**  And you've done this by taking almost by taking man out of the system and reintegrating the  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:45):**  complexity of nature.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:47):**  So I was 24 years old when I got here. I was in a recent graduated agronomy and I got frustrated  
**[0:03:56-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:03:56):**  with the cane burning, with chemical application, say I proposed to my parents and then my uncles,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:05):**  my parent partners, that if I could start making change in a cane harvester in a way  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:13):**  that the harvesters could harvest green cane instead of burned cane.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:19):**  So just because people won't be familiar necessarily with the process of burnt cane harvesting.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:28):**  Could you describe what the farm was doing 35 years ago?  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:32):**  Yeah, the canes were burned at night. In the other day, thousands of people used to start  
**[0:04:40-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:40):**  cutting with a long knife and one cane cutter used it to do 7,000 cuts per day. It's a very,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:50):**  very consuming and severe job and which I wanted to replace.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:04:56):**  And as we started mechanizing the harvesting, we started training those people to assume  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:05):**  or to occupy another positions in the organic management. Some went to work in biological  
**[0:05:12-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:12):**  control, weed control, or they became mechanics, machine operators, drivers. No one was dismissed  
**[0:05:21-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:21):**  because of the harvesting mechanization. And the thing is I was 24 when I started that  
**[0:05:28-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:28):**  and I thought I was going to take my whole life to get to accomplish this task. That  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:36):**  may, I mean to harvest green cane, but I do that when I was 29.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:43):**  And people said you couldn't do it. It's remarkable.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:46):**  And then I said, should I retire myself? So what's next? Then I thought I have to eliminate  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:05:56):**  the herbicides and then I have to eliminate the chemicals. And so I studied about, I started  
**[0:06:03-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:03):**  studying about the traditional organic production, which implies in having cattle manure and  
**[0:06:11-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:11):**  cattle manure composed and so on. And I thought, Oh my God, I would have to take on my back  
**[0:06:17-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:17):**  a cattle or a call wherever I go. So then I got completely lost. I was a traditional  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:26):**  agronomist. I went to a forest, I was lost and I thought I have to recognize I know anything  
**[0:06:34-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:34):**  in order to start learning. And then I start watching the trees. I noticed that the leaf  
**[0:06:40-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:40):**  cutting ants were not cutting any leaf inside the forest. And that there was a different  
**[0:06:48-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:48):**  order and natural water in charge of the natural production processes. And so I suddenly I  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:06:57):**  had maybe an insight and I started seeing everything happening, you know, like an infographic,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:07:05):**  like a film. And I realized that instantly, I realized that in nature, everything is about  
**[0:07:15-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:07:15):**  minerals or live organisms and energy. So, and I thought I must integrate, promote a  
**[0:07:25-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:07:25):**  deep integration among energy, minerals and energy in a way that the alive organism in  
**[0:07:34-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:07:34):**  the agricultural ecosystem permeates the minerals along the food chain. And so I thought, okay,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:07:42):**  I in green harvesting, I have the trash like here in the forest. Now I have to take all  
**[0:07:48-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:07:48):**  this life to my landfill. And I started transferring termites, all the things people see as flames.  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:07:58):**  Leontino, Leontino, before we go into that detail, I want to go back because I want people  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:03):**  to be able to get inside your mind to an extent. And I want to go back to that point at which  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:08):**  you started experimenting and building a machine for the green cane because for the green cane  
**[0:08:14-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:14):**  harvesting because it wasn't an overnight success, was it? It took several years. And  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:20):**  so you as an engineer, as a mechanic, as a problem solver, you just worked and worked  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:26):**  and worked to make sure that whoever said, no, it can't work, that they were wrong and  
**[0:08:32-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:32):**  you were right. And it seems to me that that's a process somehow that you've then taken into  
**[0:08:40-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:40):**  the forest and your amazing brain that just is able to break apart the components and  
**[0:08:47-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:47):**  understand the minutiae of how things work, that that's what you took into the forest  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:53):**  and that's what you brought out of it, having seen what was happening and how nature was  
**[0:08:58-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:08:58):**  functioning. Yeah, the machine, we took five years and 10,000 hours working day and night  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:06):**  until we finished the machine. In the middle of the development, the machine manufacturer  
**[0:09:11-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:11):**  himself didn't believe we couldn't harvest green cane. I told him, okay, you let here  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:18):**  mechanics that we are going to weld and cut this machine until we harvest green cane.  
**[0:09:25-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:25):**  I don't know if I'm too stubborn or determined, but in everything I do. So, but on the forest,  
**[0:09:34-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:34):**  I was grew in a farm. I was six years old. I used to catch snakes with my hands. I used  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:42):**  to be like the Mowgli, you know, I used to, I used to feel myself part of the natural  
**[0:09:49-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:49):**  elements. So my connection with the, the, the, the earth, the soil, the water, and so  
**[0:09:57-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:09:57):**  on, I was too strong. I was too strong. I used to stay just on shorts, you know, barefoot  
**[0:10:04-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:04):**  walking everywhere alone. I used to go 15 kilometers by bike to begin dangerous rivers  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:12):**  to fish and so on. So then when I grew, I went to the universe then we started living  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:18):**  in a city. But when I come back to work in the farms, I felt that I was reconnected to  
**[0:10:25-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:25):**  those natural forces. And I then learned how to learn from them, how to read, how to understand  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:35):**  what nature's wants to tell you, you know,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:38):**  And so you went into the forest and you saw this living infographic, um, of, of, of everything  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:46):**  just working. You say the leaf cutter ants and, and that there wasn't destruction going  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:51):**  on there. It wasn't the one species was attacking another species, but there was a certain natural  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:10:57):**  harmony that you thought to yourself, that's something I can recreate on my farm.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:11:02):**  Yeah. Yeah. But, but this, this also, this also demands from the observer a certain consciousness  
**[0:11:13-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:11:13):**  expansion. So we have somehow to open our minds and our heart to what we want to learn.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:11:22):**  You know, we have to disattach from all the prejudgments or, uh, some, I would say that  
**[0:11:32-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:11:32):**  analytical science and why we, and I lead to science is good in a certain aspect. It  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:11:43):**  puts some limits to people's mind, you know, because people will stay attached to certain  
**[0:11:48-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:11:48):**  paradigms, which then I lead to science creates for instance. Um, I used to take soil analysis  
**[0:11:57-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:11:57):**  and in the last 15 years I take this soil in my hand, I smell the soil. There are other  
**[0:12:05-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:12:05):**  biological indicators that can tell us how the soil is without having to do a soil analysis.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:12:15):**  What kind of indicators are those? For instance, the solar coil, the solar aggregates, you  
**[0:12:22-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:12:22):**  know, the most important in soil is its stability. And we, we measure soil stability against  
**[0:12:30-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:12:30):**  water through analyzing it. The soil aggregates because sand, silt and clay are sticked together  
**[0:12:41-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:12:41):**  by a proteomic glue produced by a bacteria, a colemolus, which is a micro insect, insect  
**[0:12:49-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:12:49):**  and a littering. And all this alive organism has been killed by the chemicals applied in  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:12:59):**  the conventional agriculture. And now, but this, this proteomic glue, it presents a validity  
**[0:13:07-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:13:07):**  about 60, 70 years. So we are seeing what we are seeing the world is that the green  
**[0:13:15-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:13:15):**  revolution techniques were applying in the fifties or in the sixties of the last century,  
**[0:13:22-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:13:22):**  but now it's most harmful collateral effect is appearing 60 years later or after they  
**[0:13:33-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:13:33):**  started applying this high productive production system. So because it was applied over soils,  
**[0:13:43-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:13:43):**  which bio-extructure was integrated, was good. And, but along the years and the decades,  
**[0:13:52-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:13:52):**  now the soil is becoming pulverized and the soil is losing its functionalities. It's losing  
**[0:14:00-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:00):**  for instance, its capacity of holding water. And if the soil loses the capacity of holding  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:07):**  water, you are not going to have water stock to feed the streams, the aquifer, the clouds  
**[0:14:14-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:14):**  and the plants. And your water and your water relationship has changed as well, hasn't it?  
**[0:14:20-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:20):**  Your infiltration and retention has just improved enormously. Yeah. For instance, our conventional  
**[0:14:27-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:27):**  soil in the neighbour farms here is compacted, not because of just of a high pressure dryers,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:35):**  but they are compacted because they don't have bacteria, earthworms, fungus, which keeps  
**[0:14:43-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:43):**  the soil structure alive, active. We need the soil structure to be active. It's a kind  
**[0:14:52-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:14:52):**  of a live soil. So their soil holds like 60 or 70 litres of water per square metre of  
**[0:15:02-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:02):**  soil. While our soil retains or hold 300 litres, five times more than a conventional soil.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:11):**  So in this, avoid an irrigation system. So you do not need to go to the bank to raise  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:19):**  a finance in order to buy the irrigation equipments. You are going to save water and then you are  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:24):**  going to save energy. It's just there because you've managed the soil, you have the irrigation  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:31):**  system is provided by nature. And you mentioned earthworms, but they're just one of a cornucopia  
**[0:15:39-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:39):**  of a huge range of creatures, arthropods, mammals, amphibians, reptiles that you have  
**[0:15:46-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:46):**  on the farm. What kind of numbers do you have? So in terms of earthworms, in January is the  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:15:54):**  best is when the population of earthworms is in its peak. You can find between one and  
**[0:16:01-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:16:01):**  two million active earthworms per hectare. They can move between 300 and 600 tons of  
**[0:16:09-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:16:09):**  soil per hectare per year. There's no machine to do that. On vertebrates, so and also we  
**[0:16:17-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:16:17):**  live after every year, we live all after harvesting the cane, we live 20 tons of highly dignified  
**[0:16:31-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:16:31):**  trash per hectare per year. So we have insects like termites, we have birds, we have caterpillars,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:16:40):**  we have fungus, we have meat which decomposes this trash. And I remember hearing that originally  
**[0:16:50-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:16:50):**  you had ants or a type of ants and a type of termite that were highly destructive, but  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:16:58):**  that that's changed. And what's changed is that you've got more species of termite, more  
**[0:17:03-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:03):**  species of ant and they're sort of almost controlling each other. Yeah, we had one species  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:10):**  of harmful termites to the cane. And now then after removing, after eliminating burning  
**[0:17:17-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:17):**  and chemicals, the termites which eat death matter in the forest and green waste, they  
**[0:17:26-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:26):**  migrate to the cane fields and they eat the death trash and they banish in a way, they  
**[0:17:35-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:35):**  banish the bad one. So now we don't have the bad one for the cane and we have another eight  
**[0:17:42-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:42):**  different species of termites which are not harmful to the cane. So the biodiversity of  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:50):**  termite was multiplied by eight times in the same way with ants, happening with ants and  
**[0:17:57-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:17:57):**  all other insects. So our last insect or art approach survey indicated that we have almost  
**[0:18:06-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:18:06):**  400 different insects living in harmony in the organic cane fields. And these insects  
**[0:18:14-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:18:14):**  and communities, they compose the basis of the food chain. So then we have two species  
**[0:18:21-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:18:21):**  of ant eater inside the cane fields, you know, be sustained by these termites and ants. And  
**[0:18:32-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:18:32):**  we have more ant eaters per square kilometer than in the forest because we have more trash  
**[0:18:39-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:18:39):**  to be decomposed and then we have more insects per hectare. So we estimate that we have seven  
**[0:18:47-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:18:47):**  tons of a live organism per hectare in the peak of the summer.  
**[0:18:54-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:18:54):**  Just remarkable. And I'm struck, you know, your story about creating the machine that  
**[0:19:01-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:01):**  harvested the green cane, there's a mechanical problem and you get to a point where you solve  
**[0:19:07-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:07):**  it, you get to the end, you have a machine, you don't need to reinvent the machine. But  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:12):**  with nature, it feels like it's different and you've been phenomenally successful. 35%  
**[0:19:18-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:18):**  of the world's organic sugar, a resilient business. Since transition, you've had no  
**[0:19:23-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:23):**  lost years. But the process of learning it seems continues. It's constantly observing  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:29):**  nature and using high technology sometimes to collect and replicate and spread nature's  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:36):**  best practice that you've observed then around the rest of the estate, for example, using  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:41):**  drones to spread fungal spores. After getting to harvest green cane, we enter  
**[0:19:47-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:47):**  in different phases. We needed to know how the plant works inside because everything  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:19:56):**  we do outside the plant has a reflecting side. Since we started learning, for instance, the  
**[0:20:03-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:20:03):**  plant can activate different physiological modes. So when the plant is inserted in a  
**[0:20:11-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:20:11):**  natural ecosystem, the plant turns its physiology to proteosynthesis. And when the plant is  
**[0:20:22-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:20:22):**  living as a crop and has been submitted to chemicals or chemical fertilizers or too much  
**[0:20:31-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:20:31):**  soil mobilization, the plant changes its physiological mode and which attracts plagues and diseases.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:20:40):**  And so we had to learn how the plant works inside its cells, its proteins, how the protein  
**[0:20:49-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:20:49):**  is formed and so on in order to adjust the plant feeding. And also we have to learn about  
**[0:20:57-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:20:57):**  how the different insects live in nature because sometimes a certain insects become a plague  
**[0:21:07-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:21:07):**  because you are not managing that insect or the crop in the right way. So just by through  
**[0:21:15-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:21:15):**  managing, by through changing the stewardship, we could resolve 70% of the plague and disease  
**[0:21:26-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:21:26):**  thing, you know, and the rest of the 30% is controlled biologically. We have labs where  
**[0:21:35-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:21:35):**  we produce fungus, bacterias and insects, which we use as natural enemies of the plagues.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:21:46):**  And they are releasing the field just when we feel or we detect that the other insects'  
**[0:21:53-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:21:53):**  population are going out of control. So, and then nowadays we have, we create a department  
**[0:22:01-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:01):**  where we have biology, agronomies, and where we keep developing. We run research all time,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:10):**  all along the year, since different tires, not to smash the soil and to guarantee a friendly  
**[0:22:18-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:18):**  atmosphere for the bacterias and fungus underground until new natural enemies raising and so on.  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:28):**  Because we've got producers and farmers that will be listening to this, if we could get  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:32):**  back to basics and I wonder if you could describe the life cycle of your system. What happens  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:38):**  from harvest to harvest? What actually physically happens in the fields?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:43):**  After we give the first cut in the cane, we have the trash and we do not mobilize soil.  
**[0:22:50-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:22:50):**  We do not seal. So we use special tires. They are expensive. They are constructed with a  
**[0:23:00-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:23:00):**  different rubber compost, but they allow us to use very, very, very low pressures. And  
**[0:23:10-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:23:10):**  this avoids tilling in the future, which is not good in tropical areas. So we do not change  
**[0:23:18-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:23:18):**  the soil. We do not move soil along seven, eight, nine years. And what we do after harvesting  
**[0:23:26-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:23:26):**  is to add powder rocks or lime and some organic matter, you know, in order to feed, to feed  
**[0:23:38-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:23:38):**  the soil life. That's what we do. And then we say that we activate our bioreactor. Of  
**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:23:47):**  course, that we learn a lot on how to feed in a proper way, the soil life. We are still  
**[0:23:54-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:23:54):**  learning, you know, but now we are much better than 10 years ago. And then the soil life,  
**[0:24:01-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:01):**  they communicate with the plants through the plant root as it dates. So the plant root  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:10):**  as it dates, they indicate to bacteria, fungus and insects, what kind of work they have to  
**[0:24:17-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:17):**  do in order to best support the plant growth. That's what we do. Just managing with the  
**[0:24:24-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:24):**  biota, not the cane itself. The cane here is a beneficiary of the system, not the main  
**[0:24:32-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:32):**  reactor. So I noticed that you don't leave the soil bare, that the waste from the cutting  
**[0:24:41-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:41):**  process is scattered back onto the field. Do you use some kind of cover crop or break  
**[0:24:47-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:47):**  crop? Oh yeah. In between harvesting we use three or four different legumes, a jamboree  
**[0:24:54-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:24:54):**  a giant bean called mikuna, another giant plant called crotalaria labilabi. Sometimes  
**[0:25:01-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:01):**  we do a cocktail of 13 different plants. And in our soil, in our restored soil, these crops,  
**[0:25:14-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:14):**  they reach 70 ton of green biomass within 90 days after seed.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:23):**  What do you do then? Do you then harvest those crops?  
**[0:25:28-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:28):**  No, they no. We plant directly over these crops. These crops, they have a kind of root  
**[0:25:35-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:35):**  system that breaks the soil. They go deep in the soil. They absorb lost nutrients from  
**[0:25:43-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:43):**  deep in the soil and they bring it up in the surface in order that we restore, we recover  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:50):**  lost nutrients along the soil profile. And these plants are considered, the four plants  
**[0:25:56-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:25:56):**  I use, they are considered the four best soil recovering plants in the world. And we plant  
**[0:26:06-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:26:06):**  them with the only purpose of recovering the soil and absorbing nitrogen. For instance,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:26:16):**  crotalaria after three months occupying the soil as a rotation crop, it fix 450 kilogram  
**[0:26:27-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:26:27):**  of pure nitrogen. And then we plant, we use big month planters, automatic planters with  
**[0:26:34-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:26:34):**  GPS and we plant directly or directly over these four meter high crop. And we let them  
**[0:26:42-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:26:42):**  on the surface being decompose, decompose it at the nature space, at the nature space.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:26:50):**  We do not bury, we do not bury any rotation crop. You will have to leave them like in  
**[0:26:57-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:26:57):**  a forest decomposing over the surface, on the surface of the soil.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:27:05):**  And of course you don't use any chemical fertilizers or pesticides, but you do spray waste products  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:27:13):**  from the sugar processing back onto the fields.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:27:16):**  Yeah, one of the nice things we have here is the venescence. So we have both sugar and  
**[0:27:26-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:27:26):**  ethanol production. We produce organic ethanol. We supply some important cosmetic companies  
**[0:27:35-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:27:35):**  which use organic alkyl for perfume production. And the alkyl is produced by unicellular fungus  
**[0:27:44-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:27:44):**  called the yeast. Okay. Saccharomyces cerevisis. So we feed this fungus with organic sugar  
**[0:27:52-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:27:52):**  cane juice. The fungus eat the sugar and some nutrients and the fungus release ethanol in  
**[0:28:00-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:28:00):**  the tank. We, we remove that ethanol by distillation and what is left is venescence is a explain,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:28:09):**  it is a organically explained it fertilizer. It's a certified organic fertilizer. We sprayed  
**[0:28:17-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:28:17):**  over the trash. The trash absorbs the content, the nutrients contained in the venescence,  
**[0:28:25-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:28:25):**  which is used by the organic, the alive organism as a source of energy and nutrients to decompose  
**[0:28:34-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:28:34):**  the trash. So it's a closed cycle in a way that our soil becomes more and more rich and  
**[0:28:44-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:28:44):**  it's fertility level class goes going up along the time. For instance, according to the Brazilian  
**[0:28:55-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:28:55):**  soil classification or according fertility related to fertility, 25 years ago, our soil  
**[0:29:02-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:02):**  was class three, you know, class three. Now it's class one. So this is a case of a soil  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:11):**  restoration because of the anthropological interference and composting is integral to  
**[0:29:18-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:18):**  that as well. And when I think of, you know, farms around where I live with forever seeing,  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:25):**  you know, matter that's being composted on, on a farm yard in a farm yard, then scattered  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:31):**  back onto the field. But you have an innovative approach to composting as well, composting  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:36):**  in the field and recreating nature again, through building up those layers of decomposition.  
**[0:29:42-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:42):**  What I learned, what I learned most important in that forest is that you shouldn't pile  
**[0:29:50-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:50):**  compost or any organic matter, you know, you have to promote spontaneous composting over  
**[0:29:58-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:29:58):**  the crop land in the presence of alive plants, because in nature, the, the spontaneous composting  
**[0:30:08-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:30:08):**  in layers you see in, in, in the, in the floor of, of, in the ground of the forest is a directed,  
**[0:30:17-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:30:17):**  is, is an intelligent process of composting. And it is led by the plants, you know, the  
**[0:30:25-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:30:25):**  plants as they as they to liquids from they are photosynthesis on their roots. I don't  
**[0:30:33-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:30:33):**  know, you know, but from everything the plant produces from the photosynthesis 20% is as  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:30:40):**  outdated by the roots in order to feed the soil life because the plant needs the soil  
**[0:30:47-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:30:47):**  life to promote a symbiotic relationship. The plant feeds the soil life with amino acids,  
**[0:30:55-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:30:55):**  sugars, acids, organically composts on the counterparty, the soil life to fix nitrogen,  
**[0:31:04-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:04):**  solubilizes phosphorus, synthesizes hormone growths and so on. Produces antibiotics for  
**[0:31:12-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:12):**  instance, the Bacillus subitilis, this bacteria produces antibiotics for the plant, for the  
**[0:31:19-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:19):**  plant. So most important is to have in the field alive plants because they are going  
**[0:31:27-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:27):**  to direct the spontaneous composting results to what is most needed in that ecosystem at  
**[0:31:36-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:36):**  that time.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:37):**  So in this, this transformed regenerative agriculture system that you have where not  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:43):**  only the things that we've talked about, but, but also you're running a carbon sink because  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:48):**  of the amount of carbon that your soil and your crops are drawing out of the air. You  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:31:54):**  have a low input system working with nature, remarkable success, higher than average yields  
**[0:32:01-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:01):**  for the region. Is every farmer around you trying to replicate what you do?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:07):**  I have teachers, small growers, we have transmitted to them the technology since they become exclusive  
**[0:32:15-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:15):**  suppliers because unfortunately we have at the moment an excess of organically certified  
**[0:32:23-0:32:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:23):**  sugar in the world. And ultimately this is a business, but I promised myself that I should  
**[0:32:30-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:30):**  do something which, which what I know, you know, so I don't think God gave me a gift  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:38):**  in order to promote my, just my wellbeing or my prosperity. So I, then I started providing  
**[0:32:46-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:46):**  consultancy both to small growers and to medium and big growers in other crops, which do not  
**[0:32:53-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:32:53):**  compete with against us. So I did, for instance, a very, very successful production of a reproduction  
**[0:33:03-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:03):**  system in soybean, in corn, we were working with cotton, and now I'm assisting a family  
**[0:33:11-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:11):**  which runs 6,000 nectars of lemon and orange in some public state is where the greening  
**[0:33:20-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:20):**  disease is worst. And I did a protocol to fight against the greening disease biologically.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:28):**  We already have three or four fun views. We have some, but the two areas and it's going  
**[0:33:34-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:34):**  very well. It's going very well. We change it 100% from, we switch it from a chemical  
**[0:33:42-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:42):**  fertilization to organically and powder rock fertilization. And for the first time after  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:49):**  40 years, they are fruits are not painted. We're not attacked by fungus after eight months  
**[0:33:56-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:33:56):**  of work. If you were talking to other farmers, other producers who were perhaps in cereal  
**[0:34:04-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:04):**  or vegetables, then what, what do you say? What's what, how do they take the first step?  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:10):**  What's the first thing that they need to do? I think the biggest problems is on people's  
**[0:34:16-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:16):**  mind. For instance, some producers, a producer who have 100 actors, they asked me if they  
**[0:34:24-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:24):**  can change the 100 actors. If I can, if we can apply the technology there, I usually  
**[0:34:31-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:31):**  say, you start with one actor. That is going to be that your test hub is there is where  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:40):**  you are going to learn. You need to let the plagues to eat a little bit more until you  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:48):**  have to approach the place, the way they behave. And you will have to understand why a certain  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:34:55):**  insect can be a plague or not, you know? And when I tell them that they have to separate  
**[0:35:02-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:02):**  one actor from 100 actor to do that, they say, no, I'm not going to do that. No. So  
**[0:35:08-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:08):**  the, the biggest barrier is not in the field, but on people's mind.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:14):**  What do you think is the key to your success?  
**[0:35:16-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:16):**  Yeah, I think that I, I think that I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm very lucky that I grew in a farm  
**[0:35:25-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:25):**  until my, I was 10 years old and I have this special connect, connect, connection with  
**[0:35:33-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:33):**  the, the, the water, the plants and, and the earth and the soil. I think that people are  
**[0:35:41-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:41):**  living a two urban life and people should walk barefoot. Sometimes it's just a matter  
**[0:35:50-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:50):**  of becoming feeling that we are becoming part of the environment. Again, we are organic  
**[0:35:58-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:35:58):**  beans, we are alive beans, and we must feel that we are part of the environment.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:36:09):**  And Leontino Balbo, Jr. Thank you so much for sharing your truly remarkable journey.  
**[0:36:16-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:36:16):**  Thank you very much, Ufin. Have a nice and splendid day.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:36:22):**  That was Leontino Balbo, Jr. from Sao Paulo in Brazil. In terms of land use today, there  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:36:29):**  are three things that really matter. High quality food production, climate change mitigation  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:36:34):**  and nature restoration. A great farm must do all three. I hope you'll agree that Leontino  
**[0:36:40-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:36:40):**  is living proof that regenerative agriculture provides the blueprint for the global land  
**[0:36:45-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Rock-Star-e9vqun#t=0:36:45):**  use reform we all depend upon and the transition we urgently need to see. If you've enjoyed

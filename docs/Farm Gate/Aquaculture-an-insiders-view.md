**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finn Logue Costayne.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:08):**  In 2013, for the first time, more seafood was produced globally in aquaculture systems  
**[0:00:14-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:14):**  than from wild caught fisheries. This statistic has become a trend with continuing rapid growth  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:20):**  in the aquaculture sector. The farming of fish in cages in coastal areas has come with  
**[0:00:25-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:25):**  costs in terms of pollution, protein sourcing for feed and disease. But as a relatively  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:30):**  young industry, aquaculture has followed a steep learning curve and efforts are continuing  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:35):**  to address these challenges. My guest today is Tony Wall. In 1995, he founded the Fish  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:41):**  Vet Group, which provides strategic health management advice for the aquaculture sector.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:46):**  But even before this, Tony had dedicated his working life to fish health, particularly  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:51):**  in aquaculture systems. He helped to put fish sentience on the map, is an expert in fish  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:00:56):**  ophthalmology, and today he's going to help me understand where aquaculture came from,  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:01):**  how it developed and how the industry can overcome its current challenges. Tony, hello,  
**[0:01:06-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:06):**  welcome to the programme. Thanks Finn Logue, yes and thanks for having me here. I think  
**[0:01:10-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:10):**  it's going to be an interesting hour. Well, let's start with some history if that's okay.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:15):**  Aquaculture hasn't just emerged from nowhere, has it? So just how long have people been  
**[0:01:18-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:18):**  farming fish and what sort of systems were being used historically? It's certainly an  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:23):**  awful lot longer than the recent salmon farming acceleration. People have been farming fish  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:29):**  since prehistory and it was well known in Asia that there were ponds that were both  
**[0:01:34-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:34):**  freshwater and saltwater. In the medieval period, a lot of monks had ponds both in Europe  
**[0:01:41-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:41):**  and in the south of England where they kept carp and these fish were fed on a grain-based  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:46):**  diet and I think even some scraps were given to them. In the 19th century, there were Danish  
**[0:01:51-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:51):**  ponds which were used for rainbow trout and other kinds of trout. More recently, we've  
**[0:01:57-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:01:57):**  got an explosion of the industry in Atlantic salmon. The difference is, Finn Logue, salmon  
**[0:02:03-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:03):**  have been relatively easy to grow because they've got big eggs and so that they can  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:08):**  actually be cultured all the way through so they can retain brood stock and they can fertilise  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:14):**  the eggs and they can grow them on from there. In prehistory, often the farming methods were  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:20):**  just capturing lots of very small tiny fish and closing them and then growing them on  
**[0:02:25-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:25):**  from there.  
**[0:02:26-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:26):**  Mason, I think you've got a lot of questions. I'm going to ask you a few more questions.  
**[0:02:27-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:27):**  I'm going to ask you a few more questions.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:28):**  Interesting. Now, bringing us up to date, when I think of aquaculture today, I tend  
**[0:02:31-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:31):**  to think of fish, probably salmon as we've talked about, in big round cages in Scottish  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:37):**  sea lochs or Norwegian fjords. Is that essentially what modern aquaculture looks like? If so,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:43):**  when did this kind of industrial scale fish farming first start to appear?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:48):**  It is a picture that we do have, isn't it, of large cages, square and round, but mainly  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:53):**  round these days in sea lochs and in Norway in fjords. This is only part of aquaculture  
**[0:02:59-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:02:59):**  though. If you look at parts of Southeast Asia and China where they grow immense numbers  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:05):**  of fish of different species, we've got to remember that the fish that are grown in Asia  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:10):**  are a large part of the aquaculture industry. It's just that we don't see it. The bits that  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:15):**  we do see fenlo is shrimps and the prawns that come over, and these often come over  
**[0:03:20-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:20):**  from Asian countries and Thailand. Now these have been farmed, nearly all the little shrimps  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:27):**  and prawns that we see are farmed animals. You know, this is a large part of the aquaculture  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:31):**  system.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:32):**  So, when we're thinking about aquaculture, worldwide, I suppose really, you know, what  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:36):**  are the major fish species that we're talking about?  
**[0:03:39-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:39):**  Well, crustacea is one of the big ones, but yes, pangasius and tilapia is a very important  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:45):**  species. It is, to a large extent, the species that's grown is tailored to the environment  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:50):**  very much so. You must remember that fish are cold-blooded animals. They're not the  
**[0:03:56-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:03:56):**  homeotherms that we are, you know, man's adapted to live anywhere really. Fish aren't. They  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:01):**  have very specific temperature requirements. That does preclude them from being farmed  
**[0:04:05-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:05):**  in lots of places.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:06):**  I guess, you know, for a lot of this podcast, we're going to be concentrating on the sort  
**[0:04:10-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:10):**  of fish that we see in the Scottish lochs or in the Norwegian fjords. I wonder, you  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:15):**  know, when we're thinking about the challenges in these sorts of systems and in terms of,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:19):**  you know, fish welfare, is it possible to categorise the issues as being similar for  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:24):**  fin fish and then similar for all shellfish? Or are they very much more species specific  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:30):**  than that?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:31):**  This is an area that's quite close to my heart really, because in some ways it can be classic.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:35):**  There are commonalities without a doubt. You imagine broiler production or even pig production.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:41):**  Both of them are intensive systems, but the environment is very carefully controlled.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:47):**  The humidity, the temperature, the movement of air, the disease risks, you know, there's  
**[0:04:53-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:04:53):**  a very intense biosecurity. Now that's only partly obtained in aquaculture because again,  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:01):**  we have intensive systems, but unfortunately they're exposed in an external environment  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:06):**  of which we have only a relative control of the environment. So water washes through these  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:12):**  cages, temperature is out with our control, but also is the introduction of pathogens  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:18):**  and probably just as important as the external factors like wind and waves and the climate,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:24):**  which can have a big, big effect on exposed ages in sea locks and fields. And this is  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:31):**  where it makes aquaculture particularly challenging. In some ways it's very good because you do  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:36):**  have clean water washing through the cages producing usually excellent quality, but it  
**[0:05:41-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:41):**  does mean that they are exposed to pathogens, parasites, storms, gales, plankton blooms  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:47):**  can be a problem. And you know, disease really doesn't come alone. It comes in waves really.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:53):**  So you'll find that there's usually more than one factor involved if you find fish that  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:05:58):**  have a disease problem.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:00):**  In terms of, you know, what we see in Scotland and Norway, we're talking about salmon. What  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:04):**  other species are we likely to see in those areas?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:08):**  Well salmon is a catchall term really. The salmon that are grown in Norway and Scotland  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:13):**  and Ireland, don't forget, are Atlantic salmon. But we've got to remember that one of the  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:18):**  biggest salmon producers is Chile, where they grow not only Atlantic salmon, but coho and  
**[0:06:24-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:24):**  Chinook salmon as well. And also you could classify the rainbow trout, which are part  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:29):**  of the salmon family, as also one of the species to be looked at. These are the types of salmon  
**[0:06:35-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:35):**  that are formed in the Northern hemisphere and in Chile.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:38):**  You were talking about the way in which external factors can affect the fish farms themselves,  
**[0:06:44-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:44):**  but of course the fish farms also have an impact on the world around them, both immediately  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:49):**  and more widely. And one of the challenges that I imagine people are pretty familiar  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:53):**  with in terms of salmon is that they're carnivores and they require a lot of protein. So where  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:06:58):**  does that protein come from in a fish farm?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:01):**  This is a challenge. This has been a challenge and it remains a challenge. As you rightly  
**[0:07:07-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:07):**  say, they are carnivores and they can only use a certain amount of vegetable protein.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:11):**  There is quite a bit of soya introduced into salmon feeds and that does to a certain extent  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:17):**  substitute for fish protein that's used. But most of it is white fish meal, which comes  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:24):**  from the harvesting of krill and that's usually caught in the South Atlantic. Krill is just  
**[0:07:29-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:29):**  the sort of a single cell of small organism and these are scooped up and this is the main  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:34):**  source of protein. But as you say, as aquaculture grows, how sustainable is that? It's probably  
**[0:07:40-0:07:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:40):**  not. The fish farming industry, generally speaking, has been very innovative in a lot  
**[0:07:45-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:45):**  of areas, but at the moment they're looking at things like insect protein, which is an  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:49):**  exciting source of feed for fish as well. It would be a disaster if hypothetically all  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:07:55):**  the krill was removed, which is not going to happen. It's a fast growing species and  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:01):**  so far, as far as I know, there has been no evidence of it producing changes in the ecosystems  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:08):**  where it's fished out of. But in theory, it is not sustainable if salmon farming grows.  
**[0:08:14-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:14):**  And maybe we should be looking at other species of fish which require less animal protein  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:21):**  and carp and tilapia are two of them. Neither of them have quite got the same temperature  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:25):**  requirements as salmon, but they are possibilities. The problem with salmon is, well, it used  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:31):**  to be obviously a luxury food. It's much more attractive to the buyer than a piece of white  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:37):**  tilapia or a piece of white river cobbler, which could be grown using less animal protein.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:43):**  The reason why so much salmon is grown, I think, is because it's attracted a relatively  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:48):**  high price and there's a commercial imperative to grow this on.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:52):**  You know, when we're talking about salmon, that's very clearly going in, as you say,  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:08:56):**  as a luxury product. But there are the different fish that are wild caught, you know, like  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:01):**  cod and haddock. And I wonder if there is capacity for them to stop being caught in  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:06):**  the wild and to start farming cod in the way that we do salmon.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:11):**  Cod is a very, very popular fish. It's easy to cook and they're tasty. But unfortunately,  
**[0:09:16-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:16):**  even though some cod is farmed, it's not an easy fish to farm. And it comes back to the  
**[0:09:22-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:22):**  fact that the eggs are tiny. They're very difficult to grow on from the egg stage. Normally  
**[0:09:29-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:29):**  these eggs are laid into the seawater and they float around with the currents in a planktonic  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:36):**  form. So it's much more difficult to farm cod. It is being done in some parts of the  
**[0:09:41-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:41):**  UK and in Norway, but it's not without its challenges.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:44):**  Do you think in the future, and we'll come on to the future later, but just in terms  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:47):**  of this, do you think that there is likely to be more of a swing away from wild caught  
**[0:09:53-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:09:53):**  to fish farming systems where, you know, solutions have been found to creating more sustainable  
**[0:10:01-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:01):**  sources of cod and haddock and other fish species like that? Or is it likely that cod  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:06):**  will always be a species that's fished at sea?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:08):**  I think cod could be fished, could be farmed, but again, it is mainly a carnivorous animal.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:14):**  So you don't really get away from the problems of the type of feed source. And I think that  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:18):**  is one of the big problems really.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:19):**  We'll come back to some of the other issues associated with agriculture in just a moment.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:23):**  But I mentioned at the start that you helped to put the idea of fish sentience on the map.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:29):**  And you know, when I grew up in the 1970s, it was really common for people, you know,  
**[0:10:33-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:33):**  in conversation. And I can remember lots of people fishing off harbours and in canals  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:38):**  to think that and to talk about the fact that, you know, so far as they were concerned, fish  
**[0:10:42-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:42):**  had next to no memory and they didn't feel pain. What do we know now about the way that  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:47):**  fish think and feel?  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:49):**  What we know now is simply because they've done studies to show that the nervous system  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:53):**  is very, very similar to mammals, the type of nerves and the nerve endings, the pain  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:10:58):**  receptors are the same. We know from physiological studies that fish will avoid pain, will have  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:04):**  a memory long enough to be able to stay away from something which has produced an aversive  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:08):**  effect. So the behaviour studies and the anatomic studies and there's also physiological studies  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:13):**  as well, which again would indicate and looking at some of the chemicals in the blood called  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:17):**  his own levels and other stress levels to show that fish can feel not just pain, Fennelow,  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:24):**  but also fear and distress, which are probably just as important really. And you know, these  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:29):**  are the guiding principles for farm animals are do they feel pain? Do they feel stress?  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:34):**  Are they out of their natural environments? Are they allowed to behave as a normal animal  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:39):**  would? I think the studies do show without a doubt fish can feel pain. Now, I would argue  
**[0:11:45-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:45):**  that I don't really know if my dog feels pain if I if I trodden its foot by mistake and  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:50):**  it yells, does it feel pain or is it just some kind of reaction? I don't know. But I  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:54):**  assume it feels pain. I don't know that you feel pain. Actually, you can have no idea  
**[0:11:59-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:11:59):**  whether what pain means to you. So there is an assumption and in all of these studies,  
**[0:12:04-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:04):**  but there's no difference between a fish and landing on a puppy's foot or you feeling pain.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:11):**  We've got all the evidence with points to all these showing pain, fear and distress.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:15):**  I remember you using that analogy when we spoke before the podcast, when I was asking  
**[0:12:20-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:20):**  you about lobster because of course, lobsters, you know, cooked alive. And and I said to  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:24):**  you, you know, if there'd been studies in whether lobsters feel pain in that situation  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:29):**  and I think your response was well, have there been studies into whether a dog feels pain  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:33):**  when it's kicked? It's just common sense, isn't it?  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:35):**  That's right. It is. And sometimes it's not a bad rule of thumb, really. I think the problem  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:40):**  really is that, you know, there's a very strong angling lobby, which would argue that fish  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:45):**  don't feel pain. And you can see it from their point of view that that's what they want to  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:50):**  believe. But we've got to accept the fact that fish do feel pain. And this is, you know,  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:12:55):**  it's a challenging area because some of the practices that happen to fish, especially  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:00):**  as regards to disease and management can lead to fear, pain and distress.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:05):**  It's interesting, isn't it? Because, you know, when we talk about pain, fear and distress  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:09):**  and you talk about it in the way that you have, it just makes me think, well, you know,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:13):**  that's kind of survival of the fittest. If we didn't have those abilities to feel fear,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:19):**  distress, to run away from things that are dangerous, to feel pain so that we don't do  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:23):**  something again, which is obviously bad for our physiology, then we wouldn't survive.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:29):**  So it completely makes sense that, you know, the majority of creatures have some sort of  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:33):**  experience of that nature. That's right. Exactly. It is an actual reaction  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:37):**  of fear and flight, really. And I think you've put it very well. You know, this is an inborn  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:42):**  reaction for survival. I wonder, because you were talking about the  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:45):**  studies that have been undertaken, you know, with the aquaculture industry around this.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:50):**  And I just wonder whether our knowledge about fish sentience has influenced the way that  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:13:55):**  we treat fish in farm situations and whether that's changed over the last 30, 40, 50 years.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:01):**  I don't think it's actually just specific to fish. It's when you have a large number  
**[0:14:05-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:05):**  of relatively small and dare I say it's relatively cheap animals that they don't get the same  
**[0:14:12-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:12):**  level of consideration on an individual basis as 30 cows in a field.  
**[0:14:17-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:17):**  And let me look at it like this. We talk about all the time and quite rightly so, we talk  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:22):**  about percentage mortalities and this applies across the intensive farming industries in  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:28):**  other species as well. So we'll be looking at 10, 20, 30% mortality  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:32):**  from up to the point of slaughter. That 20 or 30% is actually our individual  
**[0:14:38-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:38):**  animals, which have got the capacity to feel pain and fear and disease as well. Sometimes  
**[0:14:45-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:45):**  when I was heavily involved in the clinical side of my work, I used to try and stop and  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:50):**  think these are actual individual animals because you get caught up sometimes in numbers,  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:55):**  it can just be a numbers game. And as you say, you know, if we were looking  
**[0:14:59-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:14:59):**  at that in terms of, you know, animals that we see in the field, in the dairy industry  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:03):**  or the beef industry and the industry was working to, you know, a standard of 20, 30%  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:09):**  mortality, you know, that would be pretty shocking.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:11):**  James  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:13):**  Exactly. Exactly. That's right. You know, there are arguments to be made, counter arguments  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:17):**  to be made, you know, that fish, you can expect in the wild, much higher levels of mortality.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:21):**  And in fact, the ones that we grow and keep and farm, the mortality is nothing like as  
**[0:15:27-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:27):**  level as that. But I don't buy that argument completely because if fish are under our care,  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:33):**  they deserve better than wild caught animals. So we can't, the two things are comparable  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:37):**  really. As long as they're under our care, they've got to get the best of attention.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:42):**  Jason Vale  
**[0:15:43-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:43):**  It's almost like that's the deal, isn't it? If you're a farmed animal, then you, you know,  
**[0:15:48-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:48):**  you're going for the plate at the end, but at the same time, you're at least in theory  
**[0:15:51-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:51):**  being cared for in the interim. James  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:53):**  Exactly. That's exactly right. I think you put your finger on it really. You mentioned  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:15:58):**  in the introduction, I was very keen on fish eye work, oxymology, and I am and it's something  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:03):**  that's driven me for a long, long time. And this is a good analogy really, because I see  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:07):**  a lot of blind fish and you know, the farmer will say to me, well, you know, well, so what,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:10):**  the blind, does it really matter? Because often the fish actually can sense the pellets,  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:15):**  the feed coming into the water and they can, you know, they can probably just about get  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:19):**  around being blind. But I think they miss the point. They miss the point in fact that  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:22):**  these animals because they're under our care and they deserve better than that, there's  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:27):**  an ethical consideration. It's not just a commercial consideration or even just looking  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:32):**  at, looking at farming from a production point of view, it's actually trying to grow fish  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:37):**  in the best conditions.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:38):**  Jason I mentioned also at the start that aquaculture,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:42):**  you know, had been on a steep learning curve. And I wonder if we could just take a look  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:46):**  at some of those big challenges that the industry has had to address, you know, that we started  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:51):**  talking about earlier. And I wonder if we could start with pollution. What kind of pollution  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:16:56):**  is it that we're talking about that affect fish farms and from fish farms affect the  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:01):**  surrounding area?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:02):**  David Well, let's take them separately really.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:03):**  There's two big ones, really, aren't there? There's  
**[0:17:06-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:06):**  the pollution from the introduction of drugs and therapeutants or the chemicals that could  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:13):**  be given to the fish. You know, you'll be using very occasionally, although not much  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:17):**  these days, they'll be using a little antibiotics. They'll be using quite a lot of medicines  
**[0:17:21-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:21):**  and chemicals for the treatment of sea lice at the moment. And even the use of vaccines  
**[0:17:28-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:28):**  again got the potential for causing environmental damage, probably on a much less scale than  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:36):**  the others. Most of the in-feed treatments, and I do stress again, very little antibiotics  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:42):**  is used these days. If I can just step back, the reason why very little antibiotics is  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:46):**  used is because of the success of some of the vaccines. It's important to remember that,  
**[0:17:52-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:52):**  you know, fish farming has actually advanced quite a lot. A lot of the bacterial diseases  
**[0:17:56-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:17:56):**  have been very successfully controlled with vaccines. This is mainly due in fact to the  
**[0:18:02-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:02):**  drive and the innovation of the fish farms themselves. You can enclose them in a smaller  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:10):**  container. You can put some anesthetic in the water to make them drowsy or completely  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:15):**  anesthetised, and then you'll inject individual fish and you'll have teams of, you know, teams  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:21):**  of vaccinators doing that. And this is hugely successful, very, very successful. And it's  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:26):**  really got rid of a lot of bacterial and viral diseases.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:30):**  Toby. But they are actually just injected in the  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:32):**  same way that we might be.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:33):**  David. Yeah. There are one or two vaccines that can  
**[0:18:35-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:35):**  be given by the fish being bathed in the product. So, the vaccines applied to water in a concentrated  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:43):**  form and then the fish are plunged into it for a few seconds up to a minute or two. And  
**[0:18:48-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:48):**  that's usually absorbed through the gills. It's not as successful and most vaccines are  
**[0:18:52-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:52):**  still given by injection. There are other in-feed compounds. There's a city-like compound  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:18:57):**  which is given in feed. The way that all these in-feed compounds are, they're usually mixed  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:03):**  in with the feed at the mill or else they're coated on the surface of the pellets.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:08):**  David. So, that's one sort of pollution, you know, is the medicines and handling of medicines,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:13):**  treatments like that. There's another kind of pollution as well, isn't there?  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:17):**  David. There's the pollution that you get from waste  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:19):**  feed. And this can be quite considerable, really. I'm not going to put a figure on it,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:24):**  Finlow, because it varies very much, really. But there's huge, huge amounts of feed given  
**[0:19:30-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:30):**  to a population of fish. You know, there can be hundreds of thousands of fish in that farm  
**[0:19:36-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:36):**  all producing waste feed. So, you can imagine the amount of excrement, faeces that are produced,  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:41):**  which has got an environmental effect. A number of fish, the biomass, the total biomass of  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:48):**  fish on a farm and the medicines that are used and all the drugs are very carefully  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:54):**  controlled by, in Scotland, by SEPA, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. And there  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:19:59):**  is an equivalent in England, Norway, Ireland, Chile, Canada. They've all got these and they  
**[0:20:05-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:05):**  are carefully controlled. The most important thing is that the numbers, the total biomass  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:10):**  is controlled. And this is so that the water doesn't become polluted.  
**[0:20:14-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:14):**  And what happens if it does become polluted? Is this where you get kind of blue-green algae  
**[0:20:17-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:17):**  and things like that? Yeah, exactly. That's what happens. Well,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:20):**  if it gets polluted, the fish don't grow. Often the pollutants, as you say, you'll get  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:25):**  plankton formed. So, your oxygen crashes. And then this is a sort of a vicious cycle  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:30):**  because then there's not enough oxygen for the fish and the fish could start dying. And  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:34):**  as the fish die, it even strips out more oxygen out of the water. So, it can be a cascade  
**[0:20:39-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:39):**  of serious events. I'm interested in the biomass point that  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:43):**  you made. Because, you know, it's just in terms of trying to imagine this, because obviously  
**[0:20:48-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:48):**  a fish farm is mostly underneath the water. Mostly we don't see what's there. So, on an  
**[0:20:53-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:53):**  average fish farm, what sort of tonnage of fish are we talking about?  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:20:58):**  Well, you could look at a farm and it could have maybe half a million. This is a sort  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:03):**  of a big, but not huge farm. Half a million, four kilogram fish. So, you know, you can  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:08):**  do the maths. It's a huge, huge, huge amount of oxygen.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:12):**  And by the time you're talking about waste feed and the waste that comes from those fish,  
**[0:21:16-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:16):**  that's potentially a lot of waste that has to be managed. I mean, we're talking kind  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:20):**  of small, like a small town or something. Yeah. You know, and you know what, you're  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:25):**  right to question me on this because I think it's one of the challenging areas of farming.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:30):**  And this is a private, well, like the rest of this conversation really. It's all, it's  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:34):**  just my opinions, but this in particular is my own private opinion. And so I wonder really  
**[0:21:39-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:39):**  whether we're farming salmon in the right place. You know, we're looking at sheltered  
**[0:21:45-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:45):**  coastal areas for salmon in Scotland. In Norway, they're grown in fields, again, sheltered  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:51):**  coastal areas. Okay. There's a move to move them a little bit offshore, but you know,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:21:56):**  they're still within sight of land and they've still got the shelter of an island or two  
**[0:22:00-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:00):**  around about them, you know? So they're not really, certainly they're not oceanic by any  
**[0:22:04-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:04):**  means. And we've grown them in these areas for the very obvious reason that it's close  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:08):**  to the shore. They're easy to get to. More importantly, that there's good shelter from  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:13):**  the weather. I did touch on it earlier about how important it was that the wind and the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:18):**  waves and the storms are not so severe that they're going to damage the cages, damage  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:24):**  the nets and damage the fish. And that does happen even now, quite often. So to cut, you  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:29):**  know, to get back to the original, what I'm trying to say really is if I was starting  
**[0:22:33-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:33):**  to farm in Scotland, Norway, I would be looking at farming in the middle of the ocean. It  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:40):**  would be a very different system. It would be more in line with what oil rigs look like.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:47):**  There probably wouldn't be nets, but maybe steel structures that the fish are in.  
**[0:22:51-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:22:51):**  Jason Vale It is happening with the industry, but you  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:00):**  know what? It's not being actually pursued. And the reason is because where we farm them  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:06):**  at the moment, there's enough profits to make money without doing this, without moving them  
**[0:23:11-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:11):**  offshore. But if there was an environmental demand, or there was a commercial demand because  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:20):**  it wasn't sustainable any longer to farm them in these conditions, then they would have  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:25):**  to look at alternative way parts of growing them. The problem is that even in sheltered  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:30):**  Scottish sea locks, there have been some sites that have had to be closed down because you  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:37):**  haven't had the water exchange, the oxygen's depleted to such a level that you can't farm  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:42):**  salmon in them. And the planktonic plumes have been such that the fish have been killed.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:46):**  And presumably if you went out into the deep ocean, then that transfer, you could have  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:51):**  a relatively large amount of waste products, but because you've got that immense wash through  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:23:57):**  by comparison, it wouldn't have anything like the same impact.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:00):**  Jason Vale Absolutely. Don't forget, you're talking  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:02):**  to a vet and not a fish farmer. You know, I'm not involved in the commercial imperatives  
**[0:24:08-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:08):**  in this, but this is my vision of the future. And I think it will happen as well without  
**[0:24:14-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:14):**  a doubt that we will have to move out of these coastal areas. It's not just the actual pollution  
**[0:24:20-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:20):**  from feed and medicines either. It's also the impact of disease. There's much more.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:26):**  Sea lice, which we haven't touched on yet, and I'm sure you'll be asking me about this.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:30):**  A lot of the wild fish around the ages introduces the sea lice at some stages into the life  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:39):**  cycle of the salmon. And studies do show that there's not the same levels of infestation  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:45):**  in wild fish out in the ocean. Jason Vale  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:47):**  You mentioned, Tony, that you're a vet and not a fish farmer. And that comes onto something  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:52):**  else that we've talked about in the past, where you said that the scale of the profits  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:24:57):**  within the industry can drive bad practice. We touched on this slightly earlier when you  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:03):**  were talking about the acceptable percentage of mortalities as far as the industry is concerned.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:08):**  Tony Crowley Well, I hope I didn't use those exact words  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:10):**  because it's a bit harsh. I don't think that the profitability drives bad practice. I think  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:16):**  it lets bad practice off the hook to a certain extent, which is a slightly different way  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:21):**  of looking at it, I think. Everybody wants to get 100% survival. And of course you don't  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:27):**  do. There'll always be some losses inevitably. It's just keeping them to a minimum, really.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:31):**  But what I mean by it is that to a large extent, and it's quite acceptable, a fish farming  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:38):**  is a commercial industry and it's got to be profitable. It's got to be seen to make money  
**[0:25:44-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:44):**  for the farm, for the shareholders. If the price of the fish is such that you can still  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:51):**  make money and lose 30% of your fish, that will encourage people to keep using the same  
**[0:25:57-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:57):**  systems that they always have done. Jason Vale  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:25:59):**  But having decent profits must also have a flip side. There's the opportunity in an industry  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:04):**  that's relatively profitable to invest in research and development.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:08):**  David  
**[0:26:10-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:10):**  And fish farming has done that. There's one thing that they can really hold their head  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:12):**  up about, and a lot of other things as well. They're always driving forward research and  
**[0:26:17-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:17):**  developments and looking at things like insect protein, trying to predict disease outbreaks  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:24):**  by looking at the bacterial films on cages. There's lots of good things happening in these  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:29):**  areas. So I'm not too critical about the industry. I'm just looking at it from my own personal  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:35):**  long view that I think if the price of salmon came down to a lower level, but it wasn't  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:41):**  quite as profitable, I think maybe, you know, we might have to look at, we might have to  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:46):**  have a complete reappraisal of how we farm these fish really.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:49):**  Jason Vale  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:50):**  Another area that we've touched on, you know, we talked about disease. We know that that's  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:53):**  a big issue or can be a big issue for the fish that are clustered together, where, you  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:26:58):**  know, there are some fish in a farm and there are wild fish as well, bringing in, you know,  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:02):**  external factors. But sea lice in particular is something that regularly hits the news  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:08):**  in relation to aquaculture. I wonder if you could talk to me about how much of a problem  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:12):**  sea lice are.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:13):**  David  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:14):**  It is a problem. And it's a problem touching on the things that we've already mentioned  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:18):**  really. There's wild fish round and about who will infest the caged fish, usually the  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:23):**  salmon. And because there's a lot of animals in a small area, the numbers of lice will  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:28):**  grow very, very quickly exponentially. And managing them is really difficult. Now, because  
**[0:27:34-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:34):**  of the interaction between the salmon on farms and wild fish and going back from farm fish  
**[0:27:40-0:27:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:40):**  back to maybe wild sea trout and the effect it might have on them, there's been a lot  
**[0:27:46-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:46):**  of legislation that's been put into place in all the farming countries that the lice  
**[0:27:51-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:51):**  levels have got to be very low. This is enacted in legislation. So it means that there's  
**[0:27:57-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:57):**  an awful lot more treatments going on, sea lice treatments.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:27:59):**  David  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:00):**  And how does sea lice get treated? What happens?  
**[0:28:02-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:02):**  David  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:03):**  Two main methods really, most of it is by bath treatments. The cage will be enclosed  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:09):**  in a tarpaulin and a waterproof tarpaulin to stop the ingress of any water from the  
**[0:28:14-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:14):**  outside. And then chemicals put into the water and that kills the sea lice. And essentially  
**[0:28:20-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:20):**  they are different forms of insecticide type products, ectoparasiticides.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:25):**  David  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:26):**  And what happens to that treated water when it's been used?  
**[0:28:29-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:29):**  David  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:30):**  Yeah, good point. Until recently, the tarpaulin was just released and it was left to wash  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:33):**  out into the environment. That's why the treatments were very carefully controlled on the levels  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:39):**  of the environmental impact from the chemicals. There has been in the last two or three years  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:46):**  some innovation where fish are treated in well boats. They are pumped into well boats,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:51):**  treated in the well boats, and then the water that's used there is captured and the chemical  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:28:56):**  is stripped out of the water. This is quite an exciting innovation.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:01):**  David  
**[0:29:02-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:02):**  There's a product called CleanTreat, isn't there, that I think does that work?  
**[0:29:05-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:05):**  David  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:06):**  Yeah, that's the one I'm talking about. It could work for a lot of bath treatments. It's  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:10):**  not without its cost because you've got to use a well boat. So it does increase the cost  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:14):**  of treatment a lot. Of course, it'll only work if the chemical works and some of these  
**[0:29:19-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:19):**  chemicals become ineffective. The lice become resistant to some of these chemicals. So we  
**[0:29:24-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:24):**  do have the problem that we've got to use one treatment and then another and another.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:30):**  And you probably read in the press recently about the antibiotic resistance that you're  
**[0:29:34-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:34):**  getting in man and the problems that we have, the critical antibiotics are being mopped  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:41):**  up so quickly. You can read across to see lice treatments just the same. We have got  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:46):**  these big problems. There are other couple of treatments now where the fish is subjected  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:52):**  to an increased temperature, but very, very quickly, just for seconds. So it's about 30  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:29:57):**  degrees centigrade. And the other one is maybe brushing the lice off the fish with soft brushes.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:02):**  But both these do have major welfare issues and they can damage the fish. It's a huge  
**[0:30:09-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:09):**  challenge because the lice come from the outside, from the external conditions, and they've  
**[0:30:13-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:13):**  got to be treated so often to keep the numbers low for the sake of the legislation. And it's  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:19):**  doing the fish no good at all. And I think this is one of the biggest concerns we have.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:23):**  And it's a vicious circle then really, because if you get these kinds of conditions, the  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:28):**  fish become poor, they become damaged, and then other diseases that occur as well. I  
**[0:30:33-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:33):**  just want to mention that there are environmental conditions, especially some gill diseases,  
**[0:30:38-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:38):**  bacterial gill diseases, parasitic gill diseases like amoeba, which are increasingly common.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:44):**  And again, these are to a certain extent related to the environment that the fish are living  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:50):**  in, which does bring me back to are we farming salmon in the right parts of the seawater?  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:30:56):**  Tony, I also wanted to ask you about slaughter. Now, wild fish caught at sea are taken from  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:02):**  the water and they essentially suffocate in the air, don't they? And sometimes processing  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:07):**  even begins before they die. If this happened to land-based animals like cattle and pigs,  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:13):**  then there would be a public outcry. And it seems that this is an area where fish farms  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:19):**  can do better and do do better. For example, a lot of fish are now stunned before slaughter.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:24):**  And so what I'm wondering is if you could talk us through that stunning process and  
**[0:31:28-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:28):**  whether this happens across the board for all species, or whether there's still quite  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:32):**  a wide variance in slaughter between species and around the world.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:37):**  It's interesting really. Again, there's different sorts of methods for different species. What's  
**[0:31:41-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:41):**  technically possible for a big four kilogram salmon? It's much more difficult for a half  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:47):**  a kilogram table size rainbow trout. Let's look at Atlantic salmon to begin with. Yes,  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:52):**  you're right. Now at this present day, all the salmon that are killed for food are stunned,  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:31:59):**  usually a percussive stun, that's a bang on the head, and then they're unconscious and  
**[0:32:04-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:04):**  then the gills are cut and the fish bleeds out before it recovers consciousness. The  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:08):**  fish are usually pumped onto a table from the cages. The water is coming one way and  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:14):**  the fish swim against it, which is just the natural way that fish do. And as the fish  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:18):**  swim against the current, they end up by going down the pipe getting stunned, usually automatically  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:23):**  these days, but not always. And then they are, the gills are cut. I haven't seen this  
**[0:32:28-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:28):**  method, but I was just talking to a colleague yesterday who was telling me about a modification  
**[0:32:33-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:33):**  of this and quite an exciting one really, where the fish are given a small electrical  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:39):**  shock before the stunning process, which means the fish are much quieter, more relaxed and  
**[0:32:45-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:45):**  easier to stun. That's quite interesting, I think. And it does exemplify the way fish  
**[0:32:51-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:51):**  farms and the industry generally are all the time looking to improve their practices.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:32:58):**  Shouts are differently smaller and trout in this country, and I can only really speak  
**[0:33:02-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:02):**  about this country because I haven't seen, well, this country in Europe anyway, fish  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:06):**  are killed by an electrical stunning method. Stunning a fish in seawater is quite difficult  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:11):**  than stunning a fish electrically in freshwater and voltages and the waveforms are quite different.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:17):**  So we've got to be, it is quite specific for these rainbow trout, but they go up a pipe  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:22):**  and there's electrodes there and they end up by the fish being dead at the end of it.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:26):**  They are actually killed rather than just stunned because little fish don't get the  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:30):**  gills cut.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:31):**  Although slaughter method, which I want to mention is bass and bream in the Mediterranean  
**[0:33:38-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:38):**  countries and water. Bass and bream generally speaking can't be grown in the UK, but they  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:44):**  do very well in the Mediterranean countries and further south. These again, as you see,  
**[0:33:49-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:49):**  you've seen them probably on the fishmonger slab fin, they're quite small fish, table  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:33:53):**  sized and the way that they are harvested, killed in there is that they are netted out  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:00):**  of the water or pumped out and they go straight into ice slurry. This immobilises them to  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:05):**  a large extent. There's a huge temperature drop going down to somewhere between two and  
**[0:34:10-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:10):**  four degrees centigrade. So the fish are actually pretty immobilised, but they're not. And studies  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:15):**  have shown that these fishes are not dead. Hearts are beating and they still actually  
**[0:34:19-0:34:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:19):**  have got brainwaves, cerebral function to show that they are actually are conscious.  
**[0:34:25-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:25):**  So they're conscious, sentient, alive, just not moving.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:29):**  Yeah, exactly. They'll probably be a bit of movement, but not a lot really. And because  
**[0:34:33-0:34:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:33):**  they're at such a low temperature, they can actually, these fish remember, as I was saying  
**[0:34:36-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:36):**  before, they are, they're slaves to their external environment to a large extent. So  
**[0:34:41-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:41):**  at these temperatures, their requirements for oxygen are very low, so they can stay  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:46):**  alive for ages and ages. So often these fish will end up in the processing factory and  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:52):**  they might still be alive. And then in which case they will be gutted alive, which is,  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:34:57):**  you know, similar to what happens on wild trawlers. But we're not comparing these because  
**[0:35:03-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:03):**  these are fish under our care, these farmed fish.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:06):**  So even within Europe, there is quite a wide variety. So when we're talking about trout  
**[0:35:11-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:11):**  and salmon, you know, usually we would expect those animals to be stunned before slaughter,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:18):**  the gill cutting, but when it comes to bass and bream in the Mediterranean and warmer  
**[0:35:22-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:22):**  waters, you know, we're quite a different situation with fish being put into ice slurry,  
**[0:35:29-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:29):**  still alive, still sentient, and then potentially processed alive.  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:32):**  That's right. Exactly. Yeah. And I think it's a concern really. This is the way that they  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:37):**  used to, when I started looking at going to fish farms and I'm an old man, so it was a  
**[0:35:42-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:42):**  long time ago, but you know, the rainbow trout were killed just by leaving them to die in  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:47):**  air or they were killed the way that bass and bream are done now. And it's great that  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:51):**  these things have changed and improved so much. As you said in your introduction, it's  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:35:55):**  a relatively new industry and things have improved a lot, but I'm an old man in a hurry  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:00):**  and I'd like to see quite a few other things changed as well. You know, if necessary, if  
**[0:36:04-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:04):**  we can't control sea lice and planktonic blooms in some of these sea locks and fields, well,  
**[0:36:12-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:12):**  I'm sorry, we just shouldn't be farming there, you know, simple as that.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:15):**  Now, you talked quite a lot about the idea of fish farm moving away from the coastlines  
**[0:36:20-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:20):**  and out into the deep ocean to help with a whole range of the challenges that we've discussed.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:25):**  If that happened and if it did move out into deeper waters, do you think there may be an  
**[0:36:30-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:30):**  opportunity to develop smaller polyculture fish farms, regenerative systems, if you like,  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:36):**  based on perhaps shellfish and kelp along those coastlines where big aquaculture systems  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:41):**  currently exist?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:42):**  Yeah, I think that's right because they don't have the same environmental impact. I think  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:45):**  that's very true. You know, there's a lot of areas that some shellfish, mussel farming  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:50):**  actually removes a lot of the plankton and the single-celled animals, you know, and that's  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:36:56):**  what they use, that's what they grow on. So yes, and kelp as well, I think it's quite  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:00):**  possible, really. I think the other thing as well is, and it does happen in some countries,  
**[0:37:04-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:04):**  that we could be looking at a polyculture, that we don't just have carnivorous species  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:08):**  at the top, but we might have shellfish or urchins or other species, aquaculture species  
**[0:37:14-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:14):**  below their eating and growing on the byproducts of the fin fish above them. So yeah, I think  
**[0:37:22-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:22):**  these are areas which haven't really been developed enough.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:26):**  But they're conversations that could happen within the industry?  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:28):**  Yeah, it's conversations that should be happening as well. And you know, as I say, fish farming  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:33):**  in itself has been very innovative and there's a lot of credit to these areas, you know,  
**[0:37:38-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:38):**  while it's still so profitable, these are the areas that we should be looking more and  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:42):**  more at.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:43):**  Tony, that's been fantastic. It's been so fascinating listening to you, a real insight  
**[0:37:47-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:47):**  into the industry and the issues and challenges that it's facing. That's all we have time  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Aquaculture---An-insiders-view-e109odg#t=0:37:52):**  for. I'm afraid I'd like to thank my guest, Tony Wall, the founder of the Fish Vet Group.

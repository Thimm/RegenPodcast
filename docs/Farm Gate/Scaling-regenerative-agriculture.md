### Farm Gate  (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 12:49:04)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, the Regenerative Agriculture podcast. I'm Finnlow Costayne.  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:10):**  Forum for the Future's report, Growing Our Future, concentrates on scaling regenerative  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:15):**  agriculture in the United States. It does a really good job of describing the threats  
**[0:00:21-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:21):**  and opportunities surrounding regen and makes a series of recommendations for successful  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:25):**  regenerative transformation. While the report is centred on the USA, its findings and recommendations  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:31):**  are just as relevant for farmers, investors and policy makers in other nations. In this  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:36):**  podcast I'm talking to one of the report authors, Lesley Mitchell, Forum for the Future's  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:41):**  Associate Director for Sustainable Nutrition. I started by asking her to explain what Forum  
**[0:00:47-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:47):**  for the Future is and what it does.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:49):**  Forum for the Future does three different key things. We work one to one with businesses  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:54):**  in a much wider range of organisations now around key sustainability challenges of which  
**[0:00:59-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:00:59):**  sustainable nutrition is one. We also build or support collaborations and try and take  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:05):**  a system lens to unlocking and accelerating the scale of ambition and action towards transforming  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:11):**  towards a sustainable future. We also work to help equip others who are acting in the  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:16):**  space to look at that transformation through a systems lens. And we work around three different  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:23):**  key themes at the moment in terms of priorities. We have the 1.5 degree challenge, sustainable  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:28):**  nutrition and sustainable value chains and livelihoods. And those all interlink. But  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:32):**  we do work across a whole range of other things, whether it be housing, cities, energy, communities,  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:38):**  we work on those things. But here I'm very much focused, my role is to lead our global  
**[0:01:42-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:42):**  work on sustainable nutrition.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:43):**  Okay, so let's get into that. And that's a great description, really interesting about  
**[0:01:47-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:47):**  Forum for the Future more broadly. I haven't traditionally associated Forum necessarily  
**[0:01:52-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:52):**  with a regenerative approach to agriculture. In the past, say five years or so ago, Forum  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:01:57):**  seemed to be sort of quite emissions focused, very focused on that sort of climate change  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:02):**  element, whereas regenerative agriculture is something rather different. What is it  
**[0:02:06-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:06):**  that Forum likes about regen agriculture?  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:09):**  I would say Forum loves regenerative agriculture. It's clearly going to be the big game changer  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:14):**  of the future in terms of looking at not just carbon sequestration, but really building  
**[0:02:19-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:19):**  out a future fit food system, but it could also be apparel, a whole range of different  
**[0:02:23-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:23):**  things. So you know, very, very relevant if you're looking at cotton manmade cellulosic  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:27):**  fibres as well as food. Forum has very much, I think, historically, it was an environmental  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:31):**  organisation primarily, but it has always focused on what are just sustainable solutions  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:36):**  from a social and economic point of view as well. And so we see sustainability very much  
**[0:02:41-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:41):**  in that round. But I think the key thing is that doing less harm, making things more efficient,  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:46):**  minimising your impacts are all incredibly important, but they still lock you in to the  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:51):**  way things were done in the past. And I think we've recognised as a society now that the  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:02:56):**  scale of shift and the new thinking that's required, some of that new thinking, be very  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:00):**  old thinking about soil management, for example, but the new thinking that's required is very  
**[0:03:06-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:06):**  different to build out that regenerative future. And the difference, I think, between seeing  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:10):**  sustainability as being how can you be more efficient? How can you do less damage? How  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:15):**  can you get perhaps to a point of no harm is not going to deliver the scale of change  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:21):**  in terms of using soils as carbon sinks and getting moving towards carbon positive, but  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:26):**  more importantly, looking at those key issues of rebuilding soil health, for example, or  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:32):**  in a wider picture, building the business models that are going to support those shifts  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:36):**  to happen and having food systems that do deliver good quality food for all in a way  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:42):**  that builds value distribution down the supply chain. That means that farmers can afford  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:47):**  to both manage the risk and costs and skills of that transition, but also are rewarded  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:53):**  for, for example, the ecosystem services that they provide. And so this is the big thing  
**[0:03:58-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:03:58):**  for me within regenerative agriculture is if you look at it in terms of win-wins, the  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:02):**  first question is what are the goals of the system? So moving from an extractive to a  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:06):**  regenerative system and regeneration really means baking them.  
**[0:04:10-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:10):**  Let's just dip into that and then come back to where you were going, because I think that  
**[0:04:16-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:16):**  that description of agriculture as it is now is really interesting and also very accurate.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:23):**  It is essentially about inputs and extraction. And I think that's the same whether you're  
**[0:04:29-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:29):**  looking at kind of intensive commodity agriculture in the US or whether you're looking at a brand  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:36):**  like organic, it's still about rules. And to me, it seems that regen isn't about rules.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:42):**  It's a philosophical change as much as it is a biological change and a systems change.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:47):**  And that really requires a level of interest and intelligence and excitement about that  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:53):**  change. It's a real mindset change. So to you, what is regenerative agriculture? How  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:04:58):**  do you define it as a different sort of approach? That's a really good point. And I think you've  
**[0:05:03-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:03):**  hit the nail on the head that it's a different mindset about the goals of what that agriculture  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:08):**  system is delivering. So moving from an extractive view that looks at prioritising yield, productivity,  
**[0:05:15-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:15):**  profit income in the short term, maybe very good at minimising and being very precise  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:20):**  about its inputs, but is reliant on external inputs to a point where the goals of the system  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:26):**  are more around the quality of soil, its ability to produce and be resilient over time, its  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:33):**  ability to support its productivity into the future, but also that it sees itself in a  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:38):**  wider environment of this is about producing high quality, safe, productive food systems  
**[0:05:44-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:44):**  that are available to everyone, but it does so in a way that is renewing. But it goes  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:50):**  beyond restoring. I think the key point about regenerative farming is it is forward looking  
**[0:05:55-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:55):**  rather than looking at what can we get out of this now. And that's not to dismiss anyone  
**[0:05:59-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:05:59):**  who's working in a current context of farming. The entire farming model has been built around  
**[0:06:04-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:04):**  yield, productivity and reward for volume effectively.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:07):**  Well it's about the priorities of society, isn't it? And our priorities, since the Second  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:12):**  World War have all been about volume, about making sure that nobody goes hungry. And now  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:18):**  as we move forward and we face a different challenge, the modern existential threats  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:23):**  of climate change and biodiversity loss and other things which are sort of colliding there,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:27):**  we need to have different goals and we need to change those goals. And that's where it  
**[0:06:31-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:31):**  strikes me that this Work By forum, Growing Our Future, the report that you've just put  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:35):**  out is central to that sort of systems change. And it's a really important contribution.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:41):**  And at the heart of what you're talking about here is moving from where you've got some  
**[0:06:46-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:46):**  people who, you know, very small proportion globally, who are already regenerative agriculturalists,  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:53):**  and how we get from there, from these really enthusiastic and hugely successful people  
**[0:06:58-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:06:58):**  in their own right, how we take that, create a movement and replace, displace modern extractive  
**[0:07:06-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:06):**  agriculture. So scaling it is the term that's used. What do we mean by scaling it? And what's  
**[0:07:13-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:13):**  the model of scaling that you have in mind? Because it's a huge change we're talking about.  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:18):**  So just to give you a concept for Growing Our Future, forum acts as a catalyst. We don't  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:22):**  come up with a solution. It's not our job as a sustainability, you know, great thinker  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:27):**  to come up with a solution and then impose it upon people. So we work with the system  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:32):**  to co-create those solutions, to look at it, to help those different actors, whether they  
**[0:07:36-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:36):**  be indigenous farmers groups through to massive multinationals, policymakers, investors, to  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:42):**  look at what their role is in the system and how they can reshape it towards that new vision  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:49):**  and what needs to shift. So where are the levers you can pull to create that change  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:52):**  and how do they need to be pulled together? And that might be something as simple as understanding  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:07:57):**  different systems for adding cover crops, for example, but it probably goes beyond that.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:02):**  So looking at where that knowledge is in those incredible experts who might be sitting in  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:07):**  the niche you understand, but have embedded in decades of expertise on regenerative agriculture  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:13):**  and linking them together with others across the sector who can really pull that out and  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:18):**  who could benefit from that knowledge, but maybe have the resources and their hands on  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:23):**  the supply chains, but don't know how to shift. It has to be a genuine and again, not extractive  
**[0:08:29-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:29):**  arrangement in the sense that this isn't about parasitizing the knowledge of those who sit  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:34):**  at the core of regenerative agriculture, but really understanding where there is consensus  
**[0:08:38-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:38):**  to move forward. And I think the biggest thing about these pre-competitive collaborations  
**[0:08:43-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:43):**  is understanding that the challenge is bigger than any one of us.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:46):**  And it strikes me that there are two, I mean, broadly two different models of scaling, the  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:52):**  polar opposites. There's one which is, you know, big companies investing, making decisions  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:08:58):**  about changing their supply chains and essentially dictating the terms of the people, the farmers  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:03):**  who are contracted to them. And in that way you can scale and deliver quite rapid change  
**[0:09:08-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:08):**  across the markets. But the other is perhaps more attached to society where you have smaller  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:15):**  cooperatives, independent farmers working perhaps to sell more directly to the public.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:21):**  And it's about helping those groups, those smaller groups to replicate so that you have  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:26):**  perhaps 10 farmers working together, 50 farmers working together, but you have another 10,  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:30):**  another 50 and replicating in that way. And I wonder if you believe that it's one or the  
**[0:09:36-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:36):**  other or whether it's a combination or whether there are different forms of scaling that  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:40):**  I've kind of missed out there. Yeah, I think there's a diversity of routes  
**[0:09:44-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:44):**  to scale and just to go down a level, probably some of those are going to be around more  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:48):**  innovative business models. Can they deal with the diversity of crops that come from  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:53):**  maybe that 50 farmer cooperative that can access then or be incorporated into a supply  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:09:58):**  chain of a big multinational? Does the infrastructure support that? Who's going to change that infrastructure?  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:04):**  Do the contracting arrangements support that and provide a viable livelihood for a farmer  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:08):**  either to adjust practices or to produce those new products?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:12):**  I think one of the big, I hate to think of positives of a pandemic, but one of the big  
**[0:10:17-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:17):**  changes that has happened is a focus on, for example, new routes to market. So direct to  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:23):**  consumer, which has in some ways really democratized the linkages between the producer and the  
**[0:10:29-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:29):**  consumer themselves using internet platforms, for example. So I think what we have now is  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:35):**  a much more diverse set of products available of routes to scale. And so there's a kind  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:40):**  of, there's a range of different ways to look at that. And one of the things that Forum  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:44):**  is hoping to do over the next year or so is bring together people in the UK across the  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:49):**  regenerative agriculture system. So whether they be retailers or producers or might be  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:10:55):**  fishermen even, and all those in between, as well as consumers to look at what are the  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:00):**  new business models that are emerging that will support that transformation. That's what  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:05):**  we're doing in the US right now, but we want to adapt that kind of methodology, bring it  
**[0:11:10-0:11:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:10):**  to the UK and bring people together. The thing I notice in it is that often you get dichotomous  
**[0:11:16-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:16):**  routes to scaling because people don't trust each other. The big businesses and the small  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:21):**  niche operators actually have very different views of what a future food system should  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:25):**  look like and therefore won't necessarily connect for very good reasons in certain instances.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:31):**  But I do think that this problem is so much bigger than all of us and that diversity of  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:36):**  routes to scale means that there is a space to explore how we really grow out and accelerate  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:41):**  out of this. If we're sitting in the supposedly the decade of delivery for the SDGs and we're  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:46):**  talking about climate emergency that we've got 10 years to solve, we can't afford to  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:51):**  be worrying about being protectionist. We have a much bigger challenge to face between  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:11:56):**  us. And if we're going to put regenerative agriculture at the heart of that, the amount  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:00):**  of time it needs to transform, we really have to across the policy landscape and business  
**[0:12:04-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:04):**  landscape incentivise that shift to happen.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:07):**  You mentioned diversity there and diversity is a word that we come across an awful lot  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:11):**  in this podcast. And I think one of the things that comes out of your report, the growing  
**[0:12:16-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:16):**  our future report, is that there is a need because of the rapidity that we require, you  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:23):**  know, in terms of change, there is a need for a lot of stakeholders to move at once  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:28):**  and therefore just waiting for one or just trying to leverage government, just trying  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:34):**  to leverage citizens, it's not going to work. There's a need somehow to mobilise and motivate  
**[0:12:40-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:40):**  a whole range of stakeholders right across the board and get them to work together, if  
**[0:12:46-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:46):**  not towards the same goals, towards the same broad goals.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:49):**  So you had a beautiful way of putting it, Finlow, of mindset shifts. And so one of the  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:55):**  ways we look at this is through what we call an iceberg model. You have these events that  
**[0:12:59-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:12:59):**  are happening outside, so that might be consumers choosing something different or a new product  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:03):**  on the shelves. But what are the structures that sit below that and the patterns of behaviour?  
**[0:13:09-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:09):**  But at the bottom of it, it's what are those mindset shifts that are required? And so in  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:14):**  each kind of niche sector, whether you're an investor or a policymaker, you'll have  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:19):**  a role to play in terms of looking at that challenge and what does it mean for you? But  
**[0:13:24-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:24):**  we need to create that, or we need to enable that mindset shift across those different  
**[0:13:29-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:29):**  sectors and then look at how they fit together, because that will be the unlock. If we have  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:34):**  perverse economic incentives that mean that a small, brilliant dairy farmer with a really  
**[0:13:40-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:40):**  good robust herd cannot make a viable living and is going to have to leave the land. If  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:46):**  we have economic incentives that make that happen, then we are guaranteed to fail. So  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:51):**  we need to look at how do we incentivise that if you're a policymaker? How do we deliver  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:13:56):**  different forms of capital into that change that can feel confident of their own risk,  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:02):**  but will be patient enough to allow a transformation? And how can we reframe, for example, agricultural  
**[0:14:08-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:08):**  education and expertise and continuing professional development that will enable farmers to have  
**[0:14:14-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:14):**  access to knowledge and skills that will manage that complexity that comes with regenerative  
**[0:14:18-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:18):**  agriculture without making it complicated? How do we build it into the next generation?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:23):**  But also how do you build the roots to market that are going to reward that, but also give  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:27):**  consumers access and help consumers understand the difference in these products that are  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:32):**  about building that sustainable future, but in a way that will address some of our deep,  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:36):**  deep challenges around, for example, food poverty, food access.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:40):**  We've started moving into challenges there. And what I'd like to ask you to do, Lesley,  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:46):**  is just because I think, you know, again, we're talking about a report, not everybody  
**[0:14:50-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:50):**  can see it in front of them while they're listening. And one of the things you've got  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:53):**  in there, I'm a sucker for infographics and you have some really nice infographics in  
**[0:14:58-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:14:58):**  there about some of the challenges that we face, some of the challenges to scaling regenerative  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:05):**  agriculture. And I wonder if you can talk through one or two of those, because I don't  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:09):**  think anybody listening would doubt that there is a remarkable opportunity from regenerative  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:14):**  agriculture. If we can get it right, if we can manage to scale this up, there is the  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:18):**  huge potential to solve some of the enormous challenges that humanity faces and that the  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:23):**  world as a whole faces. But what are those key challenges to you? If you could sort of  
**[0:15:28-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:28):**  pick your top handful, top three.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:30):**  So people always look at me weirdly when I use this word, but perversity, frankly, across  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:35):**  most of the enabling factors that will support regenerative agriculture. So we look at those  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:42):**  barriers across the system and some of the big ones. So this is taken from the United  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:46):**  States, which is a particular example, but many of these will be relevant to people in  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:50):**  the UK and Europe, will be around, for example, what is rewarded, how a system supports routes  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:15:57):**  to market that are around monocultures, are around volume and are around margins and short  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:03):**  term profitability, which are not going to incentivise a transformation to a different  
**[0:16:08-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:08):**  system that is more diverse, may require more different infrastructure in terms of the supply  
**[0:16:15-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:15):**  chain, literally where you keep stuff, more diverse crops and how you market that in your  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:21):**  big retail store. One of the big shifts is around investment. One of the big challenges  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:26):**  for farmers, for example, will be the cost and risk of a transition. So if you are heavily  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:32):**  indebted because you've bought some pretty hefty kit to run your farm in the way you  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:37):**  do now, you're paying off your loans on your tractors and you're ploughing equipment, your  
**[0:16:41-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:41):**  system is built around that. Your opportunity to transition is incredibly narrow and that's  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:47):**  inevitably going to make people risk averse. So finding new ways of sharing the goal and  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:53):**  the risk around that transition, supporting farmers to make that transition financially,  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:16:58):**  that might be around building longer term contracts or premiumising or rewarding particular  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:03):**  new behaviours. We're looking with a retailer in the UK at the moment how they can shift  
**[0:17:08-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:08):**  their supply chain and some of it might be around supporting knowledge development in  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:12):**  new practices, for example. So I think some of the key barriers are really going to be  
**[0:17:17-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:17):**  around finance, they're going to be around business models, but they're also going to  
**[0:17:21-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:21):**  be around policy. And if policy and fiscal incentives do not reward the public payment  
**[0:17:26-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:26):**  for public goods in terms of ecosystem services, for example, then they will effectively be  
**[0:17:31-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:31):**  absent from the economic model. So really recognising, and I think one of the biggest  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:35):**  things we'll need to move in the next 10 years is around rewarding farmers for carbon sequestration,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:41):**  be part of RegenAg, but also rewarding farmers for stewardship of biodiversity. We always  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:47):**  focus on the fact that there's a big climate process that's had very real alarms flashing  
**[0:17:53-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:53):**  for a long time now, but there's also a UN process on biodiversity that is just agreeing  
**[0:17:58-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:17:58):**  its targets for the next 10 years. And it's been a bit of a Cinderella, but will be a  
**[0:18:01-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:01):**  key part of that future in the UK is building policy incentives around biodiversity now.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:07):**  So you've got to pull those levers at once, but it will be the big ones that build the  
**[0:18:10-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:10):**  system now need to build the system of the future.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:12):**  And it's interesting, I mean, the word you use, perversity, I think it's a really good  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:16):**  description. And, you know, if we're talking about, you know, just using a climate change  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:20):**  lens, then we can drive some really perverse outcomes. For example, shifting animals indoors,  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:25):**  just focusing on emissions, and actually exacerbating many of the problems that we see outside,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:31):**  whether those are social in terms of, you know, the quality of jobs that people have,  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:34):**  or the quality of food that's actually being produced from these more intensive systems,  
**[0:18:38-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:38):**  to the impact on biodiversity and soil health, and of course, the impact on farm animal health  
**[0:18:44-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:44):**  and welfare. And, you know, we talk about policy drivers, and those are going to vary  
**[0:18:49-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:49):**  considerably aren't they from different territories. So within the European Union, each government,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:55):**  and I'm, you know, I'm including, you know, the UK, we're leaving, but we're still within  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:18:59):**  that process of government subsidising agriculture. Traditionally, and in the UK, we're moving  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:05):**  from subsidy to payment for public goods. In America, it's very different. There are  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:09):**  other levers that the state can use. But there isn't this kind of, you know, tradition of  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:14):**  acreage payments and that sort of thing. But somehow it's finding a way of making it clear  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:19):**  that policy values many things, rather than a single thing.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:24):**  I wouldn't underestimate the scale and difficulty of that transformation, because effectively  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:29):**  you are resetting the goals and the the incentives across a whole range of different areas. I  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:35):**  think the one big learning that we have had as we look at things for and for the future  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:40):**  through a systems lens is that you have to look at climate, health, environment and economics  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:44):**  together. You can't look at them in a single silo. If we want a good food system, we need  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:49):**  to set up the conditions for it to work. And that means that farmers need to be able to  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:55):**  grow the right things in the right place for the right purpose and be rewarded for it.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:19:59):**  I love the idea of incentivising payments for ecosystem services, for example, but they  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:04):**  need to be within a business model that is viable, resilient, robust for the longer term.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:09):**  And I do think that one of the things around the new various bills that we have and Brexit  
**[0:20:14-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:14):**  means that we do have the opportunity, whatever you think about Brexit, we have the opportunity  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:19):**  for a fresh look. Some of these things are a given and we have the chance to rethink  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:23):**  again. But one thing you have mentioned there, which I think is really key, which is about  
**[0:20:28-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:28):**  the unintended consequences of single focus lenses. And Finlay, you and I have both worked  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:33):**  in the animal welfare sector for a good long time around sustainable livestock. And I think  
**[0:20:38-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:38):**  looking at the change in the narrative from being red meat bad, white meat good to understanding,  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:44):**  for example, at Forum for the Future, we have a project called Feed Compass, which is a  
**[0:20:47-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:47):**  multi-stakeholder collaboration around animal feed because 80% nion of the GHG impact of  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:54):**  a chicken comes from the feed that it has. And that is often imported feed, often with  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:20:59):**  other challenges around and I know it's broad definition, but around deforestation, might  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:04):**  be around worker livelihoods and so on, but also is very input led. I think now we're  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:09):**  seeing a change and a nuance and understanding that is allowed or enabled by the regenerative  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:14):**  agriculture lens, which says actually maintaining carbon in soils in permanent pasture or the  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:19):**  role of livestock in rotations becomes increasingly important. So we start to look at livestock  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:24):**  in a different way. And rather than it being, can we be most efficient in terms of GHGs  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:29):**  through all these inputs into monogastrics and saying, actually, you know, ruminants  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:33):**  might have a real role here in supporting carbon staying in the ground, in providing  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:38):**  incredible access and efficiency for micronutrients in dairy, for example, or in beef that's pasture  
**[0:21:44-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:44):**  reared that some of the work from Rothamsted has shown is much more efficient, starts looking  
**[0:21:49-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:49):**  at those win-wins in a different way. And we're able to do that because we've started  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:53):**  to look at the goals of the system differently. So it might be about less and better meat  
**[0:21:57-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:21:57):**  and dairy, for example, but it certainly might also be about different meat and dairy. And  
**[0:22:01-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:01):**  that actually, you know, our embattled cattle farmers of the UK, where we have so much pasture  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:08):**  available might actually be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. So we need  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:13):**  to keep that thinking upfront about what are we trying to achieve here and what are the  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:18):**  routes to action rather than demonising different sectors.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:21):**  I notice as we go through the report that there is a real nutrition lens. You know,  
**[0:22:26-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:26):**  your work is around sustainable nutrition. And in the same way in the UK, the Food Farming  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:30):**  and Countryside Commission, they're very nutrition focused. The work that they've been doing  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:35):**  has put nutrition front and centre. Why is it for you that we talk about nutrition? Why  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:39):**  is that focus on that? Is that something that you think has historically been missing?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:43):**  So we sit in this debate all the time. Are we talking about food or are we talking about  
**[0:22:47-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:47):**  nutrition? I think the key thing is seeing nutrition from the point of view of production  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:51):**  as well as consumption. And the reason we started talking about nutrition was to get  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:22:55):**  out of the lens of how much food, but rather than it being, you know, what is the productivity  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:00):**  of a piece of land, to how much nutrition does that land produce per acre per hectare?  
**[0:23:06-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:06):**  And from that point of view, looking differently at what is produced and how it is produced.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:11):**  So it's really trying to get a lens of understanding where the role of regenerative practices in  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:17):**  delivering that nutrition, but also looking at it through the lens of it not just being  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:22):**  about producing more meat or looking at it through the point of view of efficiency, but  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:27):**  how are we getting nutrition to people? So trying to keep that systems lens. I colloquialise  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:33):**  it and talk about food because we are talking about food and we're talking about farming  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:37):**  systems, but we need to look at everyone who is creating that. And the fact that, you know,  
**[0:23:42-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:42):**  we might have been looking at agriculture and the food that we provide in the UK or  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:46):**  in Europe through a lens of greenhouse gases or the environment. But the public health  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:51):**  component of this is such a huge part of the picture, whether it be from, you know, looking  
**[0:23:57-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:23:57):**  at things not necessarily through a pandemic lens, but looking at it round in providing  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:02):**  healthy nutritious diets that will deal with some of the massive challenges of non-communicable  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:06):**  diseases that we have that also massively disproportionately affect poorer people because  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:12):**  of the lack of quality nutrition.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:14):**  And you mentioned the advantages of pandemic. And one of the other good things in the UK,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:19):**  at least that's come out of the pandemic, is the government's sudden, I could say, attention  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:24):**  on obesity. And if there is going to be a serious look at obesity, then we need to have  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:29):**  a serious look at the type of foods that are being produced and the type of foods that  
**[0:24:33-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:33):**  are available for people to buy. And obviously this whole conversation can take place within  
**[0:24:39-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:39):**  that arena. It's yet another lens, isn't it, to help government better understand the issues  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:45):**  that we're talking about.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:46):**  We've talked across the programme about agriculture broadly. And, you know, just now you brought  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:53):**  up chicken farming and you mentioned the way that grass is a key component of agriculture  
**[0:24:58-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:24:58):**  in the UK. I wonder if the barriers and levers are the same in terms of scaling regenerative  
**[0:25:04-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:04):**  agriculture across agriculture, or whether we need to look at different commodity areas  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:10):**  in different ways, whether the challenges are roughly the same or whether one commodity  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:15):**  area really lends itself to a regenerative transition.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:18):**  Certainly, I think we'd have to look at dairy again, in terms of the route that dairy has  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:22):**  been going down, maximising productivity, bringing animals indoors, for example. And  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:27):**  I think there is a, dairy is ripe for review. I always throughout my career have found it  
**[0:25:32-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:32):**  astounding that we cannot build models that support brilliant small-scale dairy herds  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:38):**  in the UK when it's, you know, in many cases, Wales being a perfect example, you have all  
**[0:25:42-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:42):**  the right environments for this.  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:43):**  I think many of the challenges we recognise in regenerative agriculture are context specific  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:48):**  and place specific. So there is nuance around that, but there is no reason why we can't  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:53):**  look at those challenges together across a sector. But also I think in revisiting the  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:25:58):**  kinds of farming systems we have, we'll probably be looking at more diverse rotations and therefore  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:04):**  there being a really strong focus on landowners, for example, and their role in this in supporting  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:09):**  and enabling much more diverse rotations on their land. And therefore those farmers working  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:14):**  together with a longer term view to enabling that.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:17):**  Interestingly, through Forum for the Future's base camp at School on System Change, I was  
**[0:26:22-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:22):**  involved with a project on water in East Anglia. And that was incredible because it really  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:28):**  didn't pick up the role of agriculture in supporting a regenerative approach to the  
**[0:26:33-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:33):**  future of water and abundance in East Anglia. So I think it's not just going to be a question  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:38):**  of which sectors, which commodities work together. It's going to be potentially a landscape level  
**[0:26:43-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Scaling-regenerative-agriculture-ek0it6#t=0:26:43):**  view of who's got an interest in this, who contributes to this, how do we work together

### Farm Gate  (Tue, 08 Feb 2022 12:50:58)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Kustain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and  
**[0:00:09-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:09):**  the founder of the Food and Global Security Network.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:12):**  In the last programme, I spoke to Charlie Davis from Savills about carbon farming and  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:17):**  about the way that carbon, and more broadly, the market for natural capital goods and services,  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:22):**  is starting to shape the countryside. Today, I'm talking to two people with very different  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:26):**  roles and approaches to the carbon market, but who both believe that channelling finance  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:31):**  from carbon sequestration and storage can help to fund broader land regeneration.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:36):**  Thomas Gent is a fourth-generation farmer based on the Lincolnshire-Cabernshire border  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:41):**  in England. He's the founder of Gentile Farming and is working with Agrena.com to  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:45):**  make their carbon payment platform available to farmers in the UK.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:49):**  Juna Mikola is a regenerative agriculture specialist based in Kampala in Uganda and  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:00:55):**  he's a founder of SoilWatch, which monitors carbon levels and soil health using both satellite  
**[0:01:00-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:00):**  and ground-based measures. Welcome both.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:03):**  Hello, thanks for having us.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:04):**  Hi, thank you.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:05):**  Thomas, your family's been farming cereals and eggs for decades. What made you want to  
**[0:01:10-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:10):**  diversify into carbon sequestration and storage?  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:13):**  That's a good question. Yeah, so we've been farming cereals for four generations,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:19):**  but we've been farming sort of regeneratively or sustainably, whatever you want to call  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:23):**  it, for the past 13 years. We've always been looking at soil and how we can improve  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:28):**  it over that period. And really during the first lockdown in the UK, I started to look  
**[0:01:33-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:33):**  at all the other opportunities that regenerative agriculture could bring and carbon just became  
**[0:01:38-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:38):**  one of those ones that was interesting and it seemed like there was an opportunity in  
**[0:01:41-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:41):**  it. So yeah, I kind of set myself the challenge to see if I could make it happen.  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:45):**  And you're now working with the Danish agri-tech company Agrena to make their carbon trading  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:50):**  platform available for UK farmers. So how did that relationship develop? I think you  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:55):**  started trying to sell carbon yourself and now you've sort of got into this sort of  
**[0:01:59-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:01:59):**  slightly bigger corporate world.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:01):**  Yeah, absolutely. So yeah, I'm just a farmer. I didn't know much about carbon before we  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:05):**  started to look at this, before I started to look at this. And really in the first lockdown,  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:09):**  I had a lot of time on my hands and I set myself the challenge to see if I could make  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:14):**  the carbon offsetting happen on our farm, see if I could sell the carbon certificates  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:18):**  from our farm. And I tried many different ways to do that. I tried lots of different  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:23):**  ideas and opportunities and Agrena came across Agrena about a year ago now and they was developing  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:29):**  this carbon platform and they needed a bit of help and they needed a bit of abilities  
**[0:02:33-0:02:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:33):**  to bring it to the UK. Very kindly, they formed a relationship with me to let me bring it  
**[0:02:38-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:38):**  to the UK basically.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:39):**  And Juna, you're operating primarily in Africa and on quite a grand scale to unlock finance  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:43):**  for sustainable land use. What role does carbon play for you and the work that you do?  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:48):**  So at Woods, we are a group of co-founders, everybody has a background working on aid  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:53):**  and development and agriculture in mainly East Africa and Horn of Africa and Sahel.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:02:59):**  And as we've seen tens of probably hundreds of different projects, we could increasingly  
**[0:03:04-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:04):**  see that a lot of human suffering was actually caused by environmental degradation and land  
**[0:03:09-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:09):**  degradation. And we didn't see a lot of funding going into that. Also, we didn't see, we're  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:14):**  talking about NGOs, UN agencies and so on. We didn't see also people really understanding  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:19):**  that what land degradation is because it takes a long time to happen and what kind of a negative  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:24):**  impact that has for development. That's why how we got started with the soil. So now naturally,  
**[0:03:30-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:30):**  we increasingly see that carbon is being priced. So as we, as the land degrades, you lose carbon  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:38):**  from there, from the soil and also above current biomass and vice versa. Also, if you're able  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:42):**  to restore land, then you gain carbon. So we see that as an element to partially finance  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:49):**  landscape restoration and sustainable land use in these areas where we work.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:52):**  So it's about channelling funds that are available for carbon into delivering more sustainable  
**[0:03:57-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:57):**  land use more broadly.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:03:58):**  Yeah, exactly. So at the moment, we are in kind of like extractive land use and extractive  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:04):**  economy where we continuously driving down the ecosystem capacity to maintain human life.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:09):**  A lot of people know it, a lot of pastoralists we work with, they know it, a lot of farmers  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:13):**  know it. We hope that carbon and having a price for carbon that can help to incentivise  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:19):**  more sustainable land uses and land management regimes.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:22):**  Mason Now, that's the same for you, Thomas, isn't  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:24):**  it? That the monetisation of carbon is a way of bringing more money in generally to the  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:30):**  farm so that you're able to support that regenerative production. Now, you mentioned at the beginning  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:34):**  that you were farming sustainably or regeneratively. And of course, the two are quite different.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:40):**  So what is it that makes you certain that you're farming regeneratively?  
**[0:04:43-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:43):**  Thomas It's a really good question. And I think the  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:45):**  word regeneratively is kind of banded around quite a lot of the minutes. It seems to be  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:50):**  a very hot subject, especially in corporate worlds where this is getting used. I'm very,  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:55):**  I'm quite nervous that the word regenerative farming is going to get a bit of a greenwashing  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:04:59):**  thing where people don't quite know what it means and it gets miscommunicated. So I mean,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:04):**  when I speak, I usually say, you know, we farm regeneratively, sustainably, whatever.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:08):**  We farm focusing on the soil and partnership with nature. That's kind of how I define it  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:13):**  essentially.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:14):**  Mason And Juna, you're working, you know, the data  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:16):**  sets that you're working with are all about using, you know, big macro data, using satellites.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:22):**  And I wonder what is it specifically that you can tell from satellite data and whether  
**[0:05:26-0:05:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:26):**  you primarily rely on the data that's coming from satellites or whether there is a process  
**[0:05:30-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:30):**  of on the ground verification as well?  
**[0:05:32-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:32):**  Juna Yeah, so this is actually something quite  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:35):**  new. It's only starting from 2017. We have a bit better granular data, but we can analyse  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:40):**  more in detail what's happening on the land. So this is somehow new and that satellite  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:45):**  data is also combined with the different machine learning algorithms. So there's a lot of new  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:49):**  tech which is yet to be, we yet to find that what is the best way to leverage this technology  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:05:55):**  and science. What we measure, the main things that we measure is the photosynthetic activity  
**[0:06:00-0:06:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:00):**  and biomass being produced. And we analyse that on a timescale. So how does it change?  
**[0:06:04-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:04):**  So that's kind of the main thing you can see from the satellites. But that takes a bit  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:09):**  of modelling as well. So it's actually the way we process data and the way we analyse  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:13):**  basically three main components. There's the satellite data. So there we can get information  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:18):**  about the biomass, photosynthetic activity and so on. And then we have different process  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:23):**  based models with which we can then once we have this satellite data, we can then feed  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:28):**  in and feed in different climate factors, moisture, temperature and so on. So then we  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:34):**  can compute other variables from there as well. And yes, we do need some on the ground  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:38):**  verification as well. You're basically predicting something and then you need to go and check  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:42):**  that how far your prediction is. And in many areas there's a bit of a problem. We don't  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:46):**  have a lot of on the ground datasets. This is likely to improve. And as we have calibrated  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:52):**  the models to new areas, then we're going to need less and less on the ground verification.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:06:55):**  So you're measuring specifically moisture and greenhouse gas emissions. But when you're  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:01):**  talking about biomass, what does that look like on a satellite? What is it that you're  
**[0:07:05-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:05):**  actually seeing in order to be able to analyse?  
**[0:07:08-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:08):**  So what you see is that if you think about what makes basically this planet work is that  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:15):**  the core engine is photosynthesis. That makes water to cycle, carbon to cycle and so on.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:21):**  So and if you think about what happens in photosynthesis, you have basically energy  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:25):**  coming from the sun and then that's being bind together with carbon to biomass and then  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:30):**  you have water going in as well. And then what you have coming out is then biomass and  
**[0:07:34-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:34):**  oxygen. So plants, the leaves, they actually kind of solar panels which extend to gather  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:40):**  radiation from sun. This is what reflects back to space and we can compute certain indicators  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:47):**  based on that. Just looking at leaf growth we have depending of the plant type and so  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:52):**  on. So these are the kind of indicators. We're looking at it, that's what we can see as well.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:56):**  So it's not just carbon, we can even let's say on ranks and management we can even analyse  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:07:59):**  how much 4H per hectare is being produced. So we can tell you how many heads of livestock  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:04):**  you can grow in that area can feed. And as you know, the plants don't take carbon from  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:09):**  the soil, they rather other way around they add it to the soil. So based on that, that  
**[0:08:13-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:13):**  tells a lot what's happening for the carbon as well there and how much biomass being produced.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:18):**  And then obviously certain amount of that biomass is then carbon.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:23):**  So for both of you it seems that the motivation behind the work that you're doing with carbon  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:28):**  is to regenerate land. And while carbon's the easiest form of natural capital to monetise,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:33):**  the aim is to use the funding, to channel that funding to help deliver a much greater  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:37):**  range of ecosystem function on the land in question. And Thomas, I just wonder, coming  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:42):**  back to you, what the particular changes are that you're most interested in measuring?  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:47):**  I think this is the really exciting thing about regenerative agriculture as a carbon  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:52):**  solution compared to a lot of other ones. What happens is when we improve the soil and  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:08:57):**  when we look after it in the correct way, it definitely has a carbon benefit, but it  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:00):**  has multiple other benefits that come alongside that. You know, you don't pick one, they all  
**[0:09:05-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:05):**  kind of happen at the same time. That's how nature works. Obviously the carbon is the  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:08):**  bit that we measure and it's the bit that we can sell because that's what the companies  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:12):**  want to purchase. And it's kind of the easiest metric that we can talk about at the minute.  
**[0:09:16-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:16):**  But what we can see very quickly is biodiversity metrics coming in, water quality metrics coming  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:21):**  in to kind of build the whole package of, you know, when a farmer's making this transition,  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:27):**  he has this impact on all of these different areas. And as we start to quantify all of  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:31):**  those other areas, I really think what's going to happen is we're going to just increase  
**[0:09:34-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:34):**  that carbon value or increase the value of the produce that comes off that farm.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:39):**  It's interesting when you talk about those multiple outcomes, I'm thinking about regenerative  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:43):**  agriculture and again, how we stop it being greenwash and how we actually explain it to  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:47):**  people. And it always seems to me that basically year on year, things need to be getting better.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:53):**  And it may well be that in a particular year, there's a problem, there's a particular weather  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:09:58):**  event that changes that, but providing that trend is improving, that there is an upward  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:02):**  trajectory from each of those metrics, you can realistically say that that land is regenerating.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:07):**  Is that what you're finding on your own farm, Thomas?  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:09):**  Yeah, absolutely. It's very difficult for farmers that are on one year cycles, one year  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:14):**  short term rent agreements, that kind of thing. And when you look at, you know, yields, obviously  
**[0:10:19-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:19):**  really important every year, that kind of thing. That's the business case that a farmer  
**[0:10:22-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:22):**  needs to do to be able to keep, you know, to keep in business and to keep farming. But  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:26):**  soil improvement is such a long term game. And the regeneration of the land is not going  
**[0:10:31-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:31):**  to take one year, it's going to take decades, probably at least five years. So exactly,  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:36):**  we need to keep up those practices over that period of time to make that, to make any change  
**[0:10:41-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:41):**  really.  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:42):**  And you know, the projects that you're working on are counted in terms of hundreds of thousands  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:46):**  of hectares. And I wonder if you could talk about why it is that that land in the Sahal  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:52):**  is under threat and in need of regeneration in the first place.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:55):**  Yeah, that's actually an interesting subject. So first of all, Sahal, it means coast in  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:10:59):**  Arabic. And if you start coming down, so you have the Sahara and then you start coming  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:04):**  south, the next biome is not a rainforest, but it's precipitation gradually start to  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:09):**  increase. So you have different forms of semi arid and arid lands there, savannah and straplands  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:14):**  and so on. When we talk about degradation of that area, many times it's people just  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:19):**  mentioned climate change, what we see is it's rather just a multiplier of climate change.  
**[0:11:24-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:24):**  So it just makes things work. But the first, if you look at the drivers of land degradation  
**[0:11:28-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:28):**  in this area, it's mainly unsustainable land use. And most of that is related to food production.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:34):**  Both cropping and then livestock production. And well, there's different kind of unsustainable  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:39):**  uses is bush following, slash and burn with every seven to 10 years, land is being turned  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:46):**  to, you go to a new land and you basically turn natural ecosystems to crop land. But  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:52):**  then also a big driver of land degradation here is the livestock sector. What we see  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:11:57):**  in Sudan on the 70s, the livestock herd was about 40 million animals. And at the moment  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:03):**  it's over 140 million. And the reason why this herd has grown so fast is because the  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:09):**  pastoralist livestock system, it got integrated with the global economy. So before they were  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:14):**  mainly growing this, keeping herd for themselves a little bit for the sales, and now most of  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:18):**  it, or big part of it goes for the export. So we have a huge increase on the herd size.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:24):**  And what we think is that, so if you look at the prices, what they get, so most of their  
**[0:12:29-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:29):**  animals have been exported as live cattle, and the prices are just fractions, what they  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:36):**  have from the other parts of the world. So we see that these commodities, they don't  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:41):**  truly capture the resources that have been used for producing those products and the  
**[0:12:48-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:48):**  costs. And what is happening on the global scale, on the global trade that we're subsidising  
**[0:12:52-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:52):**  the welfare in rich countries are the cost of the ecosystems here in the poor countries  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:12:57):**  or poorer countries, which then again affect the human life here.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:01):**  Jason Vale, The New York Times, What I'm sort of hearing there is that there's been a transition  
**[0:13:05-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:05):**  away from what is essentially farming, cropping, livestock production for local markets and  
**[0:13:12-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:12):**  a gradual, I mean, over the last 30, 40 years, a gradual intensification of that in order  
**[0:13:18-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:18):**  to feed a global marketplace.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:19):**  Fabio Piscopo, The New York Times, Yeah. And actually here it's even, so here we can talk  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:22):**  about on, let's say if you have to increase your agriculture production in a country,  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:27):**  you have the vertical expansion. So let's say you try to get more out of hectare. And  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:31):**  here a lot of it is, so a lot of smallholder farmers, they use no fertilisers at all or  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:38):**  anything like that. So a lot of here it's just horizontal expansion as well. So which  
**[0:13:42-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:42):**  means that we have taken massive, massive amounts of natural habitat, dryland forests,  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:48):**  forest rangelands, and we turn them into cropland and then we farm them for a couple  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:52):**  of years and then we abandon it. And you basically leave manmade desert behind. And the same  
**[0:13:58-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:13:58):**  goes for the livestock sector that you can drive thousands of kilometres and all the  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:02):**  grass is gone. And then you talk to the people who were living there in the seventies, they  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:06):**  tell you there was a tall savannah grass growing and there was giraffes and predators and everything.  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:10):**  So a lot of that intensification has also been just a horizontal expansion of production.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:16):**  Jason Vale, The New York Times, Thomas, it seems to me, listening to what Juna said there,  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:20):**  it's a degree to which the African story of land degradation isn't so very different from  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:24):**  the story in the UK, albeit that what's happened in the Sahel is perhaps over the last sort  
**[0:14:29-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:29):**  of 40 years or so, whereas in the UK it's maybe taken 100 or 200 years. But still that  
**[0:14:35-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:35):**  commodification and pressure from the global marketplace have been key drivers in unsustainable  
**[0:14:41-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:41):**  land use. Do you think that this new global market in carbon has a capacity to change  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:47):**  that?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:48):**  That's an interesting point. And I think that's, well, it's really why I started looking into  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:53):**  all of this because I knew we was farming in a very different way, not to everybody,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:14:58):**  but to the average, I would say. And we were still having to sell on the commodity market  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:04):**  price for the commodity market value. And that was all we were getting, but I knew we  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:08):**  were producing it in a completely different way. So personally, that's what I wanted to  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:12):**  achieve. I wanted to find a way to differentiate our product. And the only way I could do that  
**[0:15:16-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:16):**  simply at the start was carbon. As I get increasingly kind of into this industry, I can see that  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:22):**  I think in the future, the value is not going to be selling your carbon certificate to a  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:26):**  company or that kind of thing. It's going to be tying it alongside your product. So  
**[0:15:30-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:30):**  what we should really be doing is valuing the product that comes from a regenerative  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:34):**  farm much greater than, for example, as Juna said, in some of those situations, which seems  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:39):**  crazy. How can you farm a land and then degrade it so much that you have to abandon it? I  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:44):**  think the point is like everything's interlinked. And when you improve soil, you improve everything.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:48):**  Improving your carbon practices or carbon impact as a farm and sequestering and reducing  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:53):**  your emissions is going to have impacts on all of those other things. So if we can focus  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:15:57):**  on kind of a simple thing that farmers can really get their heads around and actually  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:03):**  make it happen on the ground, because you have to remember that farmers have to make  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:06):**  this happen on the ground. It is a complex thing to switch away from more conventional  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:11):**  practices to using more regenerative practices in the UK on some of our soils. So we need  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:17):**  to keep it simple, but we need to allow them to get that reward.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:20):**  Juna, central to this conversation, I guess, is the degree to which we're trying to deliver  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:25):**  the multiple outcomes that you and Thomas have been talking about this morning, or whether  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:29):**  we're focused on single outcomes. And I know those are kind of polar opposites and the  
**[0:16:33-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:33):**  world doesn't quite work like that. But do you think that there are risks that the carbon  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:38):**  market could simply create new unintended consequences with land use, for example, being  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:43):**  skewed away from food production and used primarily to intensively sequester carbon?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:49):**  And indeed, if that is a risk, are there ways in which we can guard against it?  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:53):**  So we focus a lot, we work on the dry lands and rangelands and let's say 50% of the world's  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:16:59):**  surface can be classified as a dry land. And up to today, there's been mainly that people  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:05):**  clearly start to understand that resource for this forest, a big carbon sink, but what  
**[0:17:10-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:10):**  is many times poorly understood that there's way more carbon being stored in soils, for  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:15):**  instance, than in the urban environment and atmosphere together. So already the ecosystems  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:21):**  where we work, you don't have enough precipitation that there would be a full scale forest growing  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:25):**  here. So what are the kind of land uses in these areas, except of just natural habitat?  
**[0:17:32-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:32):**  By rangelands, we mainly mean areas where you'd have livestock or large herbivore, wildlife  
**[0:17:38-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:38):**  herds, benefiting for the forage and straps which are growing. In these areas, let's say,  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:44):**  from the point of view of rangeland management, actually the forage production correlates  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:49):**  positively with the soil organic matter or carbon in the soil. If we're able to put up  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:17:55):**  regimes that help to manage large areas of rangeland more sustainably, we're not actually  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:01):**  reducing the food production, we're increasing the forage production, which means we can  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:05):**  increase the herd, we just move the herd differently. And then you come to different grazing plans  
**[0:18:11-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:11):**  and rotational grazing and holistic grazing and so on. So we think for sustainability  
**[0:18:17-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:17):**  of the carbon market, there has to be these win-win situations. And the local communities  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:25):**  have to benefit from that. Even if that's not the main risk for nature-based carbon  
**[0:18:31-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:31):**  offset projects is that they're not socially sustainable. So the local communities won't  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:37):**  benefit it and that's why they will, let's say, go and cut down the trees.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:41):**  So there's a real difference in terms of the quality of the carbon drawdown and the additional  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:46):**  benefits of the carbon that's pulled in. I wonder, you know, when you're talking about  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:51):**  quality there, are you largely providing data that supports a regulated carbon market or  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:18:56):**  are you supporting the voluntary carbon market as well that Thomas is involved in?  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:00):**  Yeah, so at the moment we are looking at a lot of projects. Some projects have already  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:05):**  been there for quite a while and we're just taking an evaluation of the net carbon fluxes  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:10):**  of those activities. So the main source of funding would be then looking to scale these  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:15):**  projects and channel finance to sustainable land use. These are like what you call multilateral  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:21):**  climate finance institutions and then monetary carbon markets as well. And I would maybe  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:27):**  add there that as maybe carbon is being increasingly priced and monetized, it's even for different  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:33):**  investors and donors, it is one of the key metrics is that what is there. The same way  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:38):**  you'd be looking at how much economic value a large-scale agriculture project is creating,  
**[0:19:44-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:44):**  you've been looking at what is the net carbon flux of that project. So there's a lot of  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:47):**  different finance years who are interested on, let's say, on projects which have a land  
**[0:19:53-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:53):**  use element that what is going to be the impact on the ecosystem carbon of these projects?  
**[0:19:59-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:19:59):**  So for some people it's just about the carbon and for other people there is a desire to  
**[0:20:05-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:05):**  make sure that the carbon drawdown is happening in balance so that it's driving improved ecosystems  
**[0:20:11-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:11):**  as well.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:12):**  Yeah, so the way we see it and I need to repeat what Thomas said as well, looking at carbon  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:19):**  alone is not going to do much. What we're looking at here is we can call it something,  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:24):**  for instance, integrated landscape management, but rather an interdisciplinary approach on  
**[0:20:29-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:29):**  landscape. So we're looking at both socioeconomic factors and then we're looking at the ecological  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:33):**  factors. And for instance, we might have an agricultural investment plan and the side  
**[0:20:38-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:38):**  of the economic value it's creating, we're also calculating the value in the ecosystem  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:42):**  services that that project will create. And so there carbon also plays a role and then  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:49):**  can actually, so many times if you look at the, where does the, how do you create sustainably  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:20:55):**  value from land or even in a regenerative way, carbon only has, it's just one element  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:01):**  of finance. Maybe there's an increase for its production, maybe because you have more  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:06):**  soil organic matter, you're actually improving your profitability of, so it's pretty much  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:10):**  those same things that Thomas is also working with.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:13):**  And in terms of the carbon market, verification and quality of that carbon drawdown is clearly  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:19):**  super important. And I wonder what sort of challenges you face in your work and how you  
**[0:21:24-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:24):**  and your partners such as NGOs and the UN guard against possible destruction of the  
**[0:21:29-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:29):**  sequestered carbon assets. How do you make sure that those carbon assets don't get degraded?  
**[0:21:35-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:35):**  What are the challenges is that, let's say the dynamics of land degradation are extremely  
**[0:21:40-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:40):**  complex because you have both ecological factors that you're looking at and combined with the  
**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:44):**  socioeconomic factors. And that's why we many times, a lot of nature based solutions would  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:51):**  be seen as very simplistic that there's just the one, let's say you dig holes in the ground  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:21:56):**  or you just plant trees, I guess because you know, people are lazy to really address these,  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:01):**  the real drivers of land degradation. And we saw oftentimes socioeconomic. So I would  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:06):**  say that's the main challenge is really to understand that how can we stop financing  
**[0:22:11-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:11):**  unsustainable land use and how can we start financing sustainable land use? And I think  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:15):**  a lot of research, it's and you have to need multidisciplinary teams to do that. You need  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:19):**  biologists and you need sociologists and you have to bring all that science together. So  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:24):**  it's really complicated. And that's also the way you got it. So the main, the better you  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:28):**  do your homework, the better you really understand the socioeconomic context on the ground and  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:33):**  also the ecological factors there and how they are intertwined and how, for instance,  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:38):**  the ecosystem restoration can sustainably improve the livelihoods in that area. And  
**[0:22:44-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:44):**  we have to remember in many African countries, for instance, something like 70% of the population,  
**[0:22:49-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:49):**  their livelihood is directly depending on natural assets and natural capital. So the  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:22:55):**  only way really to improve lives in that area, sustainably, it's not giving them free food,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:00):**  but it is to improve those natural assets that then sustain human life. So I guess that's  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:05):**  the main way to go is to do your homework well, and really understand the socioeconomic  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:10):**  factors on the ground and how they're connected with the ecosystem health.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:15):**  And to make sure that the economic and the social value of working with those carbon  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:20):**  assets is greater than continuing with that sort of slash and burn approach to agriculture  
**[0:23:26-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:26):**  that was there previously.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:27):**  Exactly. So that's actually an interesting discussion is that if you, we talk about pricing  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:33):**  carbon to fix the market failure, and that is mainly there, that we've been increasing  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:39):**  the too much carbon dioxide on the atmosphere. But from the point of view of somebody who's  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:44):**  working with the land use in these areas, by pricing carbon and taking that in account  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:49):**  in economic calculations, we actually fixing much more negative externalities, not only  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:54):**  climate change. And why is that? It's because carbon is the main building block of all living  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:23:59):**  material and even actually decomposed material. So when you start actually putting a price  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:05):**  on that asset, then the economic calculation, how you're using your land, that changes.  
**[0:24:09-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:09):**  Thomas, another key principle of carbon farming is additionality. How do you on your farm  
**[0:24:16-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:16):**  go about achieving additionality and verification in terms of the carbon that you're sequestering  
**[0:24:22-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:22):**  and storing?  
**[0:24:23-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:23):**  Absolutely. So the two kind of key pillars of any carbon program is always additionality  
**[0:24:28-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:28):**  and permanence. Obviously, permanence is touched on really well, we can talk about that as  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:31):**  well. But additionality is something we need to cover, something we always have to talk  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:35):**  about. So what it means essentially is that we're doing something beyond what was normal  
**[0:24:40-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:40):**  practice and how we see it is to make any significant change to a soil to improve it,  
**[0:24:47-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:47):**  practices have to be carried out over a consistent period of time to make any reasonable change.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:52):**  So what the Agrena program does is it rewards farmers for changing away from inconsistent  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:24:57):**  or unreliable kind of uses of regenerative practices to much more consistency in their  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:03):**  usage. And farmers when they sign up to the program commit to multiple year consistent  
**[0:25:07-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:07):**  use of regenerative practices.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:09):**  And with Agrena, because I think that, you know, when you were first trying to earn money  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:14):**  for the carbon that you'd produced in your farm, you were using the Agrena system. Is  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:18):**  there sort of a toolkit that's used there for you to help with analysing those metrics  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:24):**  so that you know precisely how much additional carbon has been sequestered?  
**[0:25:30-0:25:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:30):**  Absolutely. So essentially, when a farmer wants to come and learn about what the opportunities  
**[0:25:34-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:34):**  might be for them, they come on the system, they type in their information on a field  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:38):**  by field basis, and we run the calculations through those numbers. And then we obviously  
**[0:25:42-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:42):**  do a lot of verification on those numbers at the end. But what it means is that any  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:45):**  farmer at any point can come on for free, just plug some numbers in and see what results  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:50):**  they get. It needs to be accessible and it needs to be as simple as it can.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:25:54):**  So is it an Agrena, sort of a bespoke system that Agrena has developed? Or are you plugging  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:00):**  into something like the farm carbon toolkit to get those numbers correct?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:04):**  It's a bit of a mixture of both of those things. So Agrena have their own system and their  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:08):**  own team of scientists and carbon scientists. And then we also plug in in the background  
**[0:26:12-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:12):**  to the Cool Farm tool, which is obviously an industry standard carbon calculation system.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:17):**  So it's a combination of those two things. But if you're a farmer coming on the system,  
**[0:26:21-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:21):**  you wouldn't be able to tell the Cool Farm tool is in the background, but it is.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:25):**  And of course, Cool Farm tool, as you say, you know, they are well known, certainly in  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:29):**  Britain as being, you know, very robust calculators of carbon. So that's really interesting. Now,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:35):**  for me, Thomas, the principle that farmers should deliver net zero for their own businesses  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:41):**  before using their land to offset for other industries seems to me to be quite important.  
**[0:26:46-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:46):**  I think that you have a different view.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:49):**  I definitely don't have a different view. I would agree with you. It's definitely important  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:52):**  that farmers become net zero. The interesting thing is what obviously we, you know, we have  
**[0:26:56-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:56):**  to take a bit of a position on this because, you know, we're helping farmers produce these  
**[0:26:59-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:26:59):**  certificates or run these numbers. And what we've decided is we want the farmers to decide,  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:05):**  we want the farmers are doing the work, the farmers are producing the asset and producing  
**[0:27:09-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:09):**  the carbon certificate, the farmers should decide whatever they want to do with it. We  
**[0:27:12-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:12):**  issue the certificates directly to the farmers carbon bank account, if you want to kind of  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:16):**  imagine it like that, and then the farmer does whatever he chooses. I personally think  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:21):**  in the future, you're going to get the most value out of your product, your tonne of wheat,  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:25):**  your tonne of grain, if it becomes of that net zero package. But right now, obviously,  
**[0:27:31-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:31):**  there's no option for me to sell my grain as net zero. So this year, I'm probably just  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:36):**  going to sell all of my carbon certificates. But next year, I will expect probably to keep  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:40):**  them. I hope to find a deal with a grain buyer who wants that.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:44):**  I guess at the crux of this debate, Thomas, is around the race for net zero and the fact  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:51):**  that farmers are in a unique position where they can actually deliver net cooling as well.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:27:56):**  And of course, farming and food production has been part of the problem, depending on  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:00):**  how you analyse the amount of emissions that are going into the global atmosphere. It's  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:04):**  anything up to around 30% of carbon emissions are coming from agriculture. And so there's  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:09):**  a degree to which if you're in the energy sector or in the transport sector, and you're  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:13):**  looking across at farming, then you're saying, well, why is it that farming is able, in the  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:18):**  first instance, to deliver net cooling, but why are they waiting to deliver net zero and  
**[0:28:23-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:23):**  taking my money from the energy sector or the transport sector in order to help me deliver  
**[0:28:29-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:29):**  my emissions? You're in this unique position. Is it not the case that you should be delivering  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:34):**  net zero in your own business before then going further onto that cooling and monetising  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:39):**  that additional element?  
**[0:28:40-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:40):**  It's a really good point. And it just gets, I think you've got down to the crux of the  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:45):**  matter really well. Like any other industry is working really hard to reduce their emissions.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:50):**  They're never ever going to get below zero, right? They've just got to get as low as they  
**[0:28:53-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:53):**  possibly can. Farming and what we do, we're in, you know, we've often had a tough time  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:28:59):**  in our industry, we often get the finger point at us. But this is the most exciting time  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:03):**  to be a farmer because we have this opportunity to provide solutions and to support other  
**[0:29:08-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:08):**  industries that need the help basically. Definitely, we need to, it needs to be a collaboration,  
**[0:29:14-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:14):**  it needs to be part of, you know, the whole world needs to improve. We all accept that.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:18):**  But farmers are doing the work, they're making a difference on the ground. It's not easy,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:22):**  it's expensive, it requires investment. And so they need support to do that. And I think  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:27):**  the best way to do it is putting a price on carbon and finding those companies that are  
**[0:29:32-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:32):**  doing bad, you know, releasing a lot of emissions and force, you know, forcing them to find  
**[0:29:37-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:37):**  solutions and to help solutions. And farming's in this most exciting position of, as we've  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:42):**  said before, a win, win, win. You know, if you plant a monoculture of trees, it's not  
**[0:29:46-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:46):**  great for other things. But if you plant, you know, if you improve soil, it's a win  
**[0:29:49-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:49):**  for everybody.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:50):**  MasonEMENT Of the way that you were always so positive about this, that this is a fantastic  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:54):**  time for being a farmer. And I agree with you entirely. I think this is a really exciting  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:29:58):**  moment for a whole range of different reasons. A lot of it linked into this ability to analyse  
**[0:30:03-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:03):**  the multiple metrics and understand the rebalancing of land. And carbon is of course, part of  
**[0:30:08-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:08):**  that. And, and I guess there's a degree to which whether you're offsetting for another  
**[0:30:12-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:12):**  industry or offsetting for your own business, if we're getting towards net zero and net  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:18):**  calling and we're accelerating that process. That's got to be a good thing. Juna, you're  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:22):**  helping to reverse desertification across large swathes of land in the Sahal. So you  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:26):**  must have to deal with a wide variety of farmers and pastoralists. How do you go about getting  
**[0:30:31-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:31):**  buy-in for your projects from people on the ground?  
**[0:30:35-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:35):**  Juna O  
**[0:30:29-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:29):**  Yeah, so that's actually related to what Thomas just said that I think we're in a very exciting  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:42):**  moment because for long periods of time, the society used to look down to farmers and ranchers  
**[0:30:49-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:49):**  and pastoralists. But we're increasingly now seeing that perhaps they're doing a very important  
**[0:30:55-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:30:55):**  work and that is that they are the stewards of land, which is probably the most, I mean,  
**[0:31:00-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:00):**  which is the most valuable asset that we have. The way we are working here is that a lot  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:07):**  of communities they're becoming, we set up different kind of community-based natural resource  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:12):**  management committees and so on. Farmers and pastoralists, they're not only food producers  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:16):**  anymore, but they're also conservationists and natural resource managers.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:21):**  In that case then, so let's say whether it works or not, it's still, there are project  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:26):**  way it works and there's project way it doesn't work. And there's a lot of research to be  
**[0:31:30-0:31:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:30):**  done there. I'm actually going to start also doing my own PhD research on that as well.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:37):**  The thing is what we're setting up is that farmers and pastoralists, they're going to  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:40):**  be also not just being benefiting from these co-benefits of increased natural assets such  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:45):**  as soil organic matter and increased vegetation cover and let's say improve water cycle, but  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:50):**  they're also going to be paid for carbon. So you're setting up different payments for  
**[0:31:55-0:32:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:31:55):**  ecosystem services programmes. And then let's say if a pastoralist group follows the grazing  
**[0:32:01-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:32:01):**  plan which improves the range of health, so for its production, water infiltration and  
**[0:32:06-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:32:06):**  also carbon sequestration, then they also get paid for that. But yeah, there's still  
**[0:32:10-0:32:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:32:10):**  a, there's definitely, this is a new industry and there's a lot of research to be done.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:32:14):**  But I do believe that we're going to be finding better and better ways to get the buy-in from  
**[0:32:21-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:32:21):**  the local communities. Both, that's brilliant. Thanks so much. It's  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Soil--satellites-e1e3roh#t=0:32:24):**  been a fascinating conversation. I'd like to thank my guests, Gina Michela from Soil

### Farm Gate  (2021-02-01)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. This is the second of our Regenerative Agriculture  Question Time podcasts, where we gather together experts and farmers working in the regenerative  agriculture space to answer your questions, which have come in, some by Twitter and lots  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:20):**  by email. Today I'm joined by Claire Hill, the Director of Regenerative Agriculture at  FAI Farms, George Young from Fobbing Farm in Essex and Caroline Grindrod from the Regenerative  Agriculture Consultancy, Roots of Nature. I wonder if I could start with a question  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:35):**  from me. Could you just introduce yourselves, tell us where and what you farm and as we're  recording in January and looking forward to spring, could you tell us what your chief  priorities are at this time of year and kind of what takes up most of your time? Claire,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:49):**  could I come to you first?  Yeah, hi. We farm 1200 acres in Oxfordshire. A lot of it floodplain. We do have some higher  ground which is heavy clay, which is now our cattle out wintering ground. We've got cattle,  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:02):**  sheep, laying hens and we're looking at the other options to bring more diversity into  the farm this year as far as possible broiler chickens, pigs and some vegetables. And our  time at the moment is mostly taken up with planning on the one hand, so finalising our  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:18):**  grazing plans. We've already done our grazing plans for the whole year, so we know what's  going to be where and what we're trying to factor in now is the parasite burden. We realised  that we use a lot of insecticides on the sheep for treating fly strike, or not treating fly  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:32):**  strike, preventing fly strike I should say. And we're thinking about how can we manage  differently in order to not have to use those products. So that's what's taking up our thinking  time, our physical time at the moment. It's taking up I guess with out wintering cattle.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:48):**  It actually doesn't take as much time as feeding animals in the shed, but that's what we're  doing at the moment. We've got all our calves and cows out wintering. We're just in the  process of weaning our cattle. We use a two-stage weaning process, putting nose flaps in for  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:02):**  four or five days and then separating mum and calf after that. But our plan ongoing  is actually to get to the point where we don't wean because we see that now our pastures  are becoming more diverse and our animals are getting more nutrition, not just in the  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:14):**  dry matter and energy sense, but in the trace minerals and other elements sense that actually  they're able to maintain condition much more. And the growth rates we see from the calves  of course, staying with the cow are really positive. So that's what we're kind of physically  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:29):**  doing and thinking about over the next year. Brilliant. And when you talk about out wintering,  they haven't come in yet at all through the winter, have they, your cattle?  No, our finishing animals are in, but our cows and calves are still outside. They haven't  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:43):**  come in at all. We have the building there as a backup because we're in our early stages,  but no, they're still out in the snow as we've got today.  Thanks very much. George, tell us about yourself.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:52):**  Well, hello everybody. Yes, I am George Young, aka Farming George on all the social medias.  And essentially I started off being a conventional farmer about eight years ago, transitioning  very quickly to zero till and zero insecticides. And then from about four, four and a half  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:08):**  years ago, getting even more diverse. So that kind of started off with introducing niche  crops into this system. So previously we'd just been growing wheat,  rape and peas, occasionally a bit of barley, maybe a bit of linseed. But then I diversified  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:21):**  into heritage wheat crops. So some fun varieties like Percival's Blue Cone, which is a rivet  wheat for pasta and populations such as Martin Wolf's YQ population. And then also diversifying  into crops like buckwheat, hemp and lentils. Some of those go through the, through Hodnadots,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:39):**  who I'm sure a lot of people have heard of now. But then in terms of kind of additional  diversity, which I've really been pushing in the past couple of years, we began introducing  herbal lays in 2018. We now have rather a lot of herbal lays. We're overall, we're about  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:51):**  500 hectares and we've got 80 hectares and herbal lays at the moment, which is growing  year on year. And I introduced in November, a small herd of red pole cattle. Red poles  are great for me because they're heritage and East Anglian. So they kind of fit into  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:06):**  my ethos of what I want out of the cow, but most importantly, they are dual purpose. So  they're going to be for beef and also for dairy. And I'm actually looking to bolster  my herd even more this spring, which is exciting. And yeah, last November, so a couple of months  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:19):**  ago, I planted a lot of trees, about three and a half thousand. I've got a further 3000  coming next week to plant my willow. So that's for my agroforestry project in 120 hectare  field, all manner of fruit trees, but also some birch for their sugar and also some timber  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:35):**  as well, and some, some wild margins. So that's kind of what I farm on the farm, but what  I'm up to at the moment in this rather dreary wet winter that we're going through. Where  I farm, we have a lot of problems from quad bikes and from hare courses, which is always  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:47):**  terrifically good fun. So we're doing a lot of security. We've got some fencing to do  in the next couple of weeks and some ditches and bums, the most glamorous of things to  do. And I'm actually also then doing an awful lot of research. So we're obviously doing  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:00):**  maintenance but my research this year, which is being somewhat kiboshed by COVID with me  not being able to go and visit people, but the most primary thing is going and finding  people to talk to about dairies and specifically calf foot foot dairies. So I've got some visits  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:14):**  lined up for that. And also for the bakery that I'm looking to hopefully start at the  end of this year as well.  Jason Vale,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:22):**  Well actually primarily, I'm not a farmer. So I run the Roots of Nature consultancy,  which is less of a conventional consultancy. I don't go and tell farms what to do, but  I kind of coach and train in the principles of regenerative, particularly focused on livestock  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:37):**  systems, but regenerative agriculture. I also have an organisation called Wildiculture,  which is kind of the application of regenerative agriculture, kind of hybrid between that and  and, you know, regenerative grazing and rewilding in the uplands.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:51):**  So I'm based in the Lake District, so I tend to work with farms in Scotland, the  lakes, Wales, you know, anything hilly basically that can't kind of been easily broken up  into little cells and mob grazed.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:02):**  My kind of day to day, I guess, is partly we have several projects ongoing with that  where we work much, you know, we work over a long term kind of coaching situation where  we help transition those farms to that approach.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:15):**  So I get involved, you know, visiting fairly regularly and talking on the phone to people  quite a lot.  I also work with Claire at the FAI and we're also co-developing a range of training, an  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:25):**  introduction to regenerative agriculture, in fact, sort of for people that in supply  chains and food businesses that may not fully understand what that involves.  And then we're also developing a grazing one over, you know, six to eight months, which  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:36):**  is going to really help the businesses.  And then I also have a meat business called Primal Meats.  So I kind of have a lot of different fingers in different pies, but they all kind of fit  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:43):**  together under this umbrella of Roots of Nature and, you know, they're trying to evolve, refine  and develop what regenerative agriculture is in the UK.  Superb, thanks very much.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:53):**  OK, right.  Well, let's get started with a question from Josh on Twitter.  What does a regen farmer want or need from their vet beyond the usual?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:01):**  And I guess, Claire, let's come to you first with this.  Yeah, well, I want I can't speak for everybody.  I still very much want their input.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:09):**  Rather than here's the ailment, what drugs can we use?  What I want is a conversation about what we're trying to achieve, what our holistic context  sets out, where we're trying to get to and and how we might go about about achieving  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:23):**  it.  So for us, it would be we want to absolutely maximise the biodiversity on our farm.  And therefore, we want our dung beetles and other good insects to be thriving.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:33):**  And so how can the way that we manage our animals make sure that we're doing everything  we can towards achieving that?  So I want to be having conversations like that with with our vets and it's different.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:47):**  And I would say that I'm totally prepared to pay for that advice.  You know, I realise the way that it's currently structured in where the money's made.  And I'm really happy that to flip that.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:56):**  And we do work with our vets in that way.  That's what that's what I want.  I want a conversation.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:00):**  We definitely still need that expertise, but just reframing it in a slightly different  way.  And with what you're doing, what you're talking about there is sort of linking in the management,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:10):**  having more advice about how to manage prevention of those ailments as much as it is about actually  treating them when they come along.  And I know that FAI is working quite closely with vets Sustain as well.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:22):**  Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, I mean, it's this new new ground for all of us, really.  And we're venturing into something different.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:30):**  And therefore, the way that we operate needs to change and the way we interact with each  other needs to change.  It's not just about the animals and their specific health.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:37):**  It's what what do we need to achieve on the farm?  And how do we make sure that we maintain the very best health and welfare at the same time?  Caroline?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:44):**  I completely obviously agree with Claire, we work very closely on it.  And I also, one of the directors of Wilder Culture is Alex Tomlinson, who's been on this  show before.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:53):**  And what we do is we approach it as a kind of proactive health planning sense.  So one of the services and training that she's developing is this kind of idea of yeah, how  do we create overall complexities so that we don't get the booms and busts in population,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:06):**  which generally cause the issues in the in the health and the animals.  So we would look at creating health plans that fit and knit together with the grazing  plans, as Claire said, just try and sort of stop any of these issues happening in the  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:17):**  first place.  And then if you've got problem issues, because every farm has certain species that are an  issue, and you assess the lifecycle of that organism, we call it red flag species, because  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:26):**  it's kind of out of balance.  And then you look at the lifecycle, and then you can really specifically build a grazing  plan or management plan around tackling that organism.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:34):**  So for Claire, that was one of the priorities on the farm, wasn't it, you know, absolutely  had to try and tackle the parasite burden.  So the grazing plan, the primary objective of the grazing plan was to try and address  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:43):**  that first.  So that's how Yeah, absolutely.  So any help from vets on, you know, proactively looking at those organisms studying that with  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:51):**  their amazing knowledge, and then applying it to the whole system approach would be brilliant.  And that's quite a change, isn't it for I think, for a lot of vets, and I think, you  know, there's there's an increasing amount of information out there, isn't there amongst  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:03):**  vet organisations.  And of course, that sustain is particularly good at sharing information about how how  vets can work in that space in the future, how potentially they can still make a decent  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:13):**  living, even though the business model for farm vets might change gradually as we as  we move forward.  Thank you very much.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:20):**  We've got one here from Liz by email.  We've talked a lot about livestock grazing and regenerative agriculture on the podcast.  This is a question about Arabborn just says, what are the basic regenerative principles  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:32):**  for growing cereals?  And I guess this is the question that's tailor made for you, George?  Well, I mean, following obviously, the livestock question, there are actually quite a lot of  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:41):**  similarities in actually kind of making sure you're planning your rotation around issues  you're likely to have rather than addressing a problem when you get a problem.  And that's certainly kind of the approach that I'm taking.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:51):**  One of the big things for me is is kind of looking at the fact that we know we need beneficial  insects.  And if you need beneficial insects, I think the very first port of call is saying, right,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:01):**  well, we absolutely cannot use insecticides across the farm, you must stop that.  And then it's looking at the fact and saying, right, well, why am I going to have issues  with any pests on my crop in the rest of the system without using that insecticide.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:12):**  And a lot of that is actually then driven by artificial nitrogen.  So kind of spikes of nitrogen supply causing issues, so causing cell wall weakness, making  the plants super sugary.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:21):**  So they're really attractive to those pests.  So it's kind of looking at the overall system and saying, right, so in which case I need  to cut down on my artificial nitrogen, and I need to make sure that I've got a huge amount  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:30):**  of habitat available for my insects to live in.  And this is kind of where my agroforestry project kind of came in.  And also, you know, about this idea of trying to really interconnect the farm.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:40):**  So my agroforestry is not just spouts of trees in parallel down a field, it also combines  wild margins in that field that then link those wild margins to a wild seam that connects  the entire farm together.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:52):**  This is a really critical kind of overall farm assessment of how do I make my farm interconnect.  How do I ensure that there's always somewhere for all insects, small mammals, bigger mammals,  and birds of prey to actually kind of exist in an ecosystem to really create that?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:07):**  And then also, how do I create organic nitrogen in this system?  So actually, as it happens, if you're really going to be a regenerative cereal farmer,  livestock is absolutely critical, because that's how you're going to drive your genuine  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:19):**  fertility in your soil, not your kind of spoon fed fertility that will enable you to have  really strong plants, really strong cereal plants.  If they have any kind of issue with a pest coming on board, you know, also, you've got  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:29):**  your habitat there for your beneficials to come and attack that pest and the ecosystem  actually functions.  So I think from from growing cereals, that's a kind of rough overview.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:37):**  I think what we really need to create on farm to tackle that and grow cereals regeneratively.  Thanks, George.  And when we're talking about regenerative principles, what do you feel about soil cover?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:46):**  Is that something that you're constantly trying to make sure that it's not left bare at any  time?  Yeah, so soil cover is a very important one.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:53):**  It's just so many people bash on about cover crops now.  I mean, ironically, there's obviously a question about tillage as well.  And and I think there's obviously an argument there then between the people who want something  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:02):**  entirely organic and those people who want something entirely zero till.  And I'm certainly someone who's migrated from a viewpoint of wanting glyphosate and genuine  zero tillage to a perspective now where I actually feel like not using glyphosate in  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:16):**  any pesticides and using a small amount of tillage is a better overall system, but only  on the proviso that you have a very, very large area of your farm under permanent organic  cover, which is never, ever disturbed and provided you also keep that window of tillage  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:30):**  very, very small and ensure that you get crops established in it, either a cover crop or  a cash crop established in that ground as soon as you possibly can.  Really interesting as a huge amount of thought and research that you're clearly going into  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:41):**  on your farm, which is which is fascinating.  I've got a question here.  I'm going to toss this over to Caroline.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:46):**  I think a question from Pippa by email came in by email.  I want to move towards an out wintering system, but my land is heavy clay, so the cattle would  just trash it.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:56):**  Any thoughts?  Yeah, so I live in I live in an area of Britain that gets two metres of rain a year or so.  We're very familiar with very wet ground and also heavy clay ground.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:07):**  And I work, as I said, with a few key projects, all of which started with the idea that there's  absolutely no other way that we could out winter.  And I think the key thing is it's all about planning ahead.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:16):**  So if you and a lot of farmers, what you introduce this concept to are just looking at their  fields in the middle of winter that are short grazed down, you can see the soil and you  can imagine the mess if you just turned a herd of cattle in there and they all stood  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:26):**  round to be able, you know, which is what you tend to see.  And everyone has this kind of very negative association with out wintering.  But to do it out wintering properly, you need to be planning kind of, you know, a year ahead  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:35):**  like Claire's planning her grazing, you know, you know, a long way ahead.  And you need to design the entire system around ensuring that you've got enough ground, the  right ground in the right, you know, the right place and that you've allowed it to grow long  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:46):**  enough so that you've got deep roots, tall grass that's going to be able to provide a  kind of a thatchy protective surface and that you're allocating it in a way that means that  they're not hanging around in the same place and poaching it.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:57):**  So they might only be in there for two or three days depends on the grounds depends  on the context depends on the system.  So there's no fixed way of doing this.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:04):**  But absolutely, it's certainly not a case of just expecting to be able to turn a lot  of animals into an area in the middle of winter at work.  It's not that at all.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:12):**  And also just to make sure that people understand regardless of what soil type you've got, you  can improve the structure.  So clay could be one of the best potential soils and you know, textures to work with  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:21):**  over the long term.  But you know, you need to start that soil structure building processes and allowing  long recovery periods that then go into out wintering is a really great way of doing that.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:30):**  And then of course, the sort of trampling and littering and then a long rest period  again, you know, is a really great way of accelerating soil structure and having that  benefit so that over time, it will hold up against poaching much, much better.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:42):**  And if you do get a little bit poaching, it's like not the end of the world because you  know, as long as you have a long recovery period, it's usually recovered.  And in some cases that allows little, you know, the seed bed to be stimulated and species  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:52):**  to appear that might not have done had you just been, you know, gently set stocking it.  So planning ahead, absolutely critical.  But you know, Claire's gone through this process as well.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:00):**  So any tips she's got or thoughts on that?  And what I was sort of taking from there as well is, you know, rest.  Rest is the most powerful tool in the toolbox.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:09):**  Before I come to you Claire, I'm going to come to another question, but perhaps you  can link the two.  There's another livestock question, this one from Bill in the Northwest by email.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:17):**  How do you deal with rushes?  My land is wet and the rushes are just getting worse each year.  We also have rushes, although we don't get the rainfall that Caroline and others are  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:27):**  getting, but we are, we do manage quite a large area of floodplain.  And so we do have rushes down there and we're organic.  So we used to just top them and it sort of worked, but they're still growing and you  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:38):**  know, a bit creeping out, getting more and more each year.  But since we've, since we started raising in this way of which I would totally agree,  rest, it feels it's totally counterintuitive.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:49):**  Like it should be the more I graze, the more grass I'm getting from it, but actually the  more you graze, the more diversity that comes and that's more nutritious for the animals  and then they eat less and so on and so on.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:58):**  So what we, what we are doing on our system is we aim to graze, rest everything for between  three and six months.  And then we use the animals as a tool.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:07):**  So on our rushy areas, we might put them in slightly smaller areas so that they really  went in and broke up some of those rushes.  And then with that, and with the impact of the urine and dung kickstarting the soil biology  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:21):**  with the action of trampling and then along rest period, those conditions become really  favourable in the soil biology for other species to thrive.  And bit by bit, the rushes go, rushes are an indicator species that soil biology isn't  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:34):**  happy.  And so it's a case of adjusting our conditions to make it less favourable.  So is that about succession?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:40):**  It's about, you know, the rushes, they're there because the conditions are right for  them and so you just got to change the conditions effectively.  Yeah, they're mother nature's way of holding the soil together, keeping everything going.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:51):**  What, in the absence of anything else, when the conditions start to change and there's  more action in the soil, the biology is less favourable for the rushes to grow.  Do you have any additional thoughts, Claire, on the, on the heavy clay question?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:03):**  Yeah, so I lost count of the number of people that have said, you know, you're never out  winter on this farm, you're crazy.  And it took us a few years to get the confidence in which to do it.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:12):**  But then we spoke to other farmers who had had the same thing said to them.  And now we say the same thing to others.  The key thing is, is moving them every day.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:21):**  So not every day, sorry, we would we would work on about an every two day move, but you  know, two to three days, so they're not in one area for too long.  And that's key.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:29):**  We couldn't out winter where we just turn them out all winter, and then stay on the  same area.  And the great thing about that is that you might have a field 10 or 20 acres, and you're  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:38):**  grazing that first cell, it might take a month or so even more to get all the way across  the field.  But that means that first cell has had already one month of rest by the time that animals  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:48):**  get to the other side of the field.  And that's key is that moving them on frequently.  We use bales as well to give them extra fodder, because we're not growing as much as we need  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:56):**  yet.  But moving frequently is the key.  George, you're arable rather than livestock, but how do you deal with?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:03):**  I guess I guess the issue is particularly wet spaces.  Well, I mean, if I was going to say traditionally what we would have done, when I mean, when  I first came back to the farm, Dad was busy getting some additional drains, land drains  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:14):**  put in on some some wet patches on a couple of fields.  And ironically, they haven't worked very well.  And either they weren't put in well in the first place, or maybe we shouldn't be land  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:22):**  draining it.  And I think this really comes down to just looking at why you've got those wet patches.  And is there really that much gain from actually bothering to underdrain those areas?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:33):**  Sometimes I think it's better to kind of assess your farm that you can actually even go online  and see kind of old maps, 150, 160 year old maps you can find online and overlay over  Google and like see, see what was going on in your farm at the time and kind of just  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:46):**  assess and think, well, do I want to be thrashing the hell out my farm?  Do I want to spend a load more money on land drainage?  Or do we instead say, you know what, we've got a wet patch here where I am, we've got  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:54):**  a few springs in a few fields, they cause wet patches.  They're not big enough to worry about.  But I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, I've got a spring there.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:01):**  Well, why don't we have a bit of a pond and allow nature to occur in that area and just  farm around?  Let's stop worrying about having large square fields where we farm everything, but instead  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:11):**  actually be a little bit more sympathetic to nature and let it have those spaces that  just aren't that productive.  And when you're talking about needing to rebuild insect populations and so on, of course, those  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:20):**  are highly productive places for that to happen.  Yeah, precisely.  There's this whole worry that kind of we've been kind of drilled into us that if you have  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:27):**  wet spots there, they end up being really compacted and anaerobic.  And that's where your black grass starts, which is true because you probably shouldn't  be cropping them.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:35):**  So don't crop them.  Don't get the black grass problem there.  Don't take that black grass problem from that area out into the rest of your field.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:41):**  Only crop the area of your field that is nicely aerobic and leave those areas to be there  exactly for those other wildlife that we want on the farm.  Fantastic.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:50):**  Thank you.  Well, here's a quick one.  And I think I'm going to have a go at answering this one myself because it's probably my area.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:55):**  So a question from Dave at home on Twitter says, is it possible to calculate and publish  climate impact figures, e.g. some sort of CO2 equivalent for each crop and animal product?  Well, I'm just going to go through this.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:09):**  And I'd say the simple answer is that this sort of information has been calculated by  various academics over the last decade or so.  But the real question is, is this actually helpful?  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:17):**  And to my mind, the answer is no.  And in fact, it can be extremely misleading.  For example, at a global level, using the old GWP 100 metric for measuring the carbon  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:28):**  impact, beef, cattle and sheep will come out badly.  But when they're reared in regenerative systems with integrated agroforestry in there as well,  perhaps at five or 10 percent, then the impact is calculated using GWP star, which accurately  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:41):**  accounts for the warming impact of the methane.  Then ruminant farming can actually become carbon positive with the farm system sequestering  more carbon than it produces, which seems very counterintuitive when we're looking at  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:53):**  these global figures.  But what really matters is that we move away from these global averages, take them with  a relative pinch of salt and think about what matters, which is the individual impact of  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:03):**  each and every farm.  So really, carbon footprinting with GWP star really ought to be a basic entry level requirement  for every farm these days.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:12):**  That's my view.  Anybody got any alternative or different thoughts on that?  I completely agree with you, Finn Law.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:18):**  You know, I think we just need to get away from this idea of this global diet that's  based on mechanistic calculations and look at, OK, well, actually, you know, it's giving  us a false choice.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:27):**  We need to look at what can we produce in each region?  What's appropriate for the landscape?  What's appropriate for the people?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:32):**  You know, we don't have each individual farm is owned by individuals with individual needs.  And it's absolutely right that we should it should be contextual.  So we need to look at, OK, what can we do here?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:42):**  Focus on that.  It's about nutrition.  It's not just about calories.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:45):**  There's so much to this question, as you say, we could go into it.  But ultimately, I think it's extremely unhelpful to try and take a global approach to fixing  that.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:53):**  The next question's linked, I suppose, to this.  And I think, George, I get asked this really pretty frequently in various forms.  And this time the questions come in by email from Brian in Staffordshire.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:02):**  He says, regenerative agriculture is great, but do you really think that it can feed the  world when the population is expected to be 10 billion by 2050?  Well, I kind of love this question.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:13):**  And Caroline just used two very fantastic specific words associated with this, which  are calories and nutrition.  So I put it down to that there are two really simple examples I can use here.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:24):**  The problem is we're focusing this when people ask this question, they focus on the farmer.  That's the wrong thing to be looking at.  We need to be looking at the food system that we as farmers feed into.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:32):**  The first one we look at is to say, cereal production.  And specifically, let's talk about wheat and the staff of life, which is bread.  Now the funny thing is, so when I'm growing my heritage crops of wheat, I'm growing sort  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:42):**  of three and a half, maybe four tonne a hectare.  I can't get these super high flying tonnages that people get on their large scale conventional  farms.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:51):**  But the funny thing is, let's say that that person who's who's yielding 10, 12 tonne of  milling wheat every single year, unfortunately, where that wheat is going into, it's going  into a process where it's being roller milled, which basically splits the wheat up to form  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:04):**  just a very kind of stable white flour that doesn't have any of the brown or any of the  germs and none of the oils in that wheat are there.  All you've got is essentially the calorific content of the wheat grain in that flour.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:17):**  And it then is made into bread in something called the Chorley Wood process, which essentially  makes a loaf of bread in something like 40 or 50 minutes.  It goes from flour to bread in that amount of time.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:26):**  And it uses a tonne of yeast.  And basically, a lot of that yeast is then still active in the final bread product and  the gluten hasn't been broken down in the bread.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:34):**  So these are a lot of reasons as to why we're having tummy problems eating breads like this.  And also because it's been made so quickly, it hasn't had time to make the nutrition in  that flour, what nutrition there is in that less nutritious flour, hasn't had the time  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:47):**  to make that nutrition bioavailable.  So instead, eating a loaf of Chorley Wood bread is the equivalent of just eating calories.  So someone might have grown a fantastic crop, you know, 12 tonne crop of wheat, but all  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:58):**  it's doing is fattening people.  It's not actually nourishing them.  My, you know, my system where I'm growing three and a half to four tonne of wheat, going  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:04):**  through a stone milling process, which keeps everything involved in that.  So even if you choose a sifted flour, you still have a lot of the oils, which means  that that flour product has got a shelf life, it must be used.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:14):**  But if that's then going into a sourdough process of bread making, that long fermentation  time with natural yeasts allows the gluten strands to be broken down, allows all the  yeast to die off.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:24):**  The gluten is actually a different form in heritage products, in heritage wheats anyway.  And suddenly you end up with a product in that sourdough loaf where the nutrition is  two and a half to three times more bioavailable to a human than in the Chorley Wood loaf.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:37):**  So it's just a context of actually what do we mean by feed the world?  Do we mean that everyone gets to eat three and a half, four thousand calories of food  a day?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:45):**  Or do we mean that people actually get to eat two thousand calories of really nutritionally  high quality food, which is then going to fix a huge number of issues we've then got  with the health system, all the diet related diseases, obesity, all those problems get  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:58):**  fixed by the fact that actually if we ensure our food system is fixed and then we supply  the correct product for that food system, we're then going to end up with a healthy  population that is not only fed, but also nourished.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:09):**  So taking, I mean, I'm fascinated by what you say as someone who eats an awful lot of  toast.  But I think the short answer to the question of whether you think it can feed the world,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:18):**  you know, by 2050 is yes, definitely.  Yeah, like without a shadow of a doubt.  And I actually even believe that we can feed the world with considerably less land use  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:28):**  than we are currently doing for agriculture at the moment.  And we actually have the ability to free up land in the UK for actual genuine flood management,  you know, taking land out of production that's on the water meadows, put those water meadows  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:40):**  back, have room to actually bring back in keystone species that were eradicated in the  UK centuries ago, species like beavers and plenty of others, potentially room for links.  And that's like a really key way if we can really fix this food system, we also get the  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:53):**  chance to actually genuinely fix our ecological system to generally begin to reverse the biodiversity  loss that we're seeing at the moment.  So again, for you, I guess the, you know, the critical part of that is using land for  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:04):**  what it what it should be used for what it's what it's appropriate to be used for, rather  than forcing it into production, you know, which is only possible because of because  of chemicals and and and intensity.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:15):**  And I guess it's worth mentioning at this point, the food farming and countryside commissions  farming for change report, which addresses this question directly.  So what the FFCC have done is to use the IDRI modelling that was used EU wide and applied  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:29):**  it to Britain specifically.  And they found that, you know, we can feed ourselves perfectly well with a wholly agro  ecological approach to agriculture.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:38):**  And in fact, you know, as you said, we'd be healthier to there'd be better nutrition coming  out of that, but that our approach to food would have to change.  And I think, you know, your, your story there, George sort of clearly indicated that as well  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:51):**  greater diversity coming through better use of, you know, proper nutritional food being  grown rather than just calories being grown people eating more legumes and vegetables,  less meat and dairy, particularly less chicken and pork because the emphasis is on producing  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:05):**  land appropriate food.  So you know, I urge people to have a look look up that report the farming for change  report from the food farming and countryside commission.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:12):**  It is excellent.  Okay, moving on, we have a question from John King, the Connemara farmer on Twitter.  He says, can you suggest non chemical preferably biological methods of parasite control, specifically  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:23):**  attacking the lifecycle of parasites like ticks, blow fly, liver flute worms, given  that I'm at a wet farm, fencing off places just isn't an option.  Who's going to go first on this?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:34):**  Caroline, can I come to you?  Yeah, so it kind of loops back into what we were saying already, actually, about parasites  and red flag species is that actually, maybe what we shouldn't be doing as much and it's  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:44):**  certainly interesting to look at the individual organism, but instead of thinking, how do  I kill that organism, I think you need to broaden the thinking out to think how do we  design a system that means that the organism isn't thriving.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:55):**  So actually, it's not just about finding a kind of less toxic way of killing.  It's about finding ways of promoting diversity and complexity in the system so that we don't  get the booming and busting of those individual populations.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:06):**  So it's firstly looking at a kind of a design that is, you know, considering the whole but  if you've got problems, species like tick and fluke, which is something that we deal  with a lot in our parts of the world, and then absolutely be about back to those long  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:20):**  rest periods, looking at those life cycles, what other organisms are going to eat those  so for instance, tick, what has happened in the upland environment particularly is that  you've got a lot of burning going on in the heather areas, you've got a very large number  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:34):**  of, you know, set stock raised sheep and deer, there are hosts all year round that sort of  boosted the population.  And there's nothing attacking that insect.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:43):**  So the things that sort of regulate the tick are kind of spiders and wasps and those are  actually damaged by things like burning and set stock raising and lack of diversity.  So we need to be looking at why is that booming?  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:56):**  And it'll be many different reasons.  It's never just one.  And how do we sort of proactively manage?  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:01):**  So for instance, on the wilde culture projects, we'll be looking at, okay, where are the tickiest  areas at what times of the year?  Let's not be there.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:07):**  So we would look at how do we create better structure in our upland environment with taller  vegetation so spiders can thrive and birds can thrive.  And so we very much take that proactive approach.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:18):**  We look at the breeds of animals that we're keeping, so they're not going to be as impacted  by those species.  So we select for the ones that are doing best.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:24):**  And so we take a whole system approach to trying to tackle that particular organism.  So yeah, just let's focus less on the organism, study it, find out where its weak spots are,  and then think about the whole system.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:34):**  How can we design something that's going to kind of reduce its impact and balance it out?  I'm trying to find ways of summarising that into a sort of few key bullet points.  And I mean, the things I've written down, they're sort of encouraging the insects and  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:47):**  birds that predate on things like the snails that carry the liver fluke parasite, that  kind of thing.  Somebody on Twitter the other day was talking about having ducks and geese integrated in  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:56):**  the system because they love gobbling up those sorts of things.  Having higher grasses so that the animal's heads are higher, they're not eating so low  down where things like fluke again would insist themselves.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:11):**  And having heavy impact to try and bring up the diversity from the ground, from things  like mob grazing, is that a fair summary?  I think that's an excellent summary, absolutely.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:21):**  And I think the other thing to mention is rather than, again, when you do have to respond  to a parasite infestation or whatever it is, try and find the least toxic way of doing  it so that you're not just damaging the entire ecosystem that's keeping the thing in balance.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:35):**  So I mentioned dung beetles and things earlier, you know, and, you know, anything from face  flies to parasites.  We've essentially damaged through our response to trying to treat that.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:46):**  All of the things that are actually regulating it.  So it's a case of how do we build a system so it's more complex and stops the booming  of that population?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:53):**  And then how do we respond to the inevitable, you know, issues that we've got in a less  toxic way?  And I'm trying to address all of it.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:00):**  Claire, I wonder if you have anything to add to that?  I would agree with everything.  And it's been an interesting year as we've tried to get our head around thinking in this  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:09):**  way.  And the example for us this summer has been that we don't get it very often.  But this year we had a real problem with New Forest Eye.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:17):**  And of course, initially it was just about treating it and getting those animals better  as quickly as possible and trying to minimize the spread of infection.  But then what we did as a farm team that we've never done before was sit down and do this  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:29):**  red flag kind of deep dive to try and find the root cause.  So why did it happen?  How did it happen?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:34):**  And we just kept asking why every time we got to a well, it's because the flies got  to the cows in the world because the cows are on the river meadow and there's more flies.  And it's like, well, most of our summer grazing is river meadow.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:46):**  So why, why, why?  And we worked out that really looking at the life cycle of the fly that causes New Forest  Eye that actually the predators of that are things like dung beetles.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:58):**  And so our answer is that actually we need to create more dung beetles to eat the flies  more quickly, eat the fly larvae so they don't become flies and they don't get around the  cattle so much.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:07):**  That's hence my reference earlier to thinking about the different insecticides we're using  with the sheep.  So that's just a kind of worked example that we've experienced over this last year.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:16):**  And that's almost taking us sort of full circle back to that first question about vets because,  you know, that's the kind of thing that, you know, obviously farmers like yourselves can  share that information, but vets could be fantastic hosts of that information and could  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:30):**  share that information as well.  And it feels like, you know, you probably at FAI had vets that were part of that conversation  with you.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:36):**  And so having that advice coming from vets at the same time as having the experience  of farmers should be really helpful moving those sort of conversations forward.  Yeah, we kind of work in two ways with vets, I guess.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:47):**  We work with vet sustain because we're looking at kind of how do we change things, what needs  to happen, what does regenerative veterinary look like?  And then we also day to day as a farm, we have our farm vets and so we're working in  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:59):**  and bringing those into the conversation.  It's really interesting and that's where we get kind of those two strands of advice from.  One other point just to make on the vet side actually is that I think another role for  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:10):**  regenerative vets, if you like, is to feed into sort of the conventional vets where that  is necessary so that they understand the plan that you're running.  So it's kind of acting as a bridge, you know, so Alex can help us through wildeiculture  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:22):**  design plans and then help the farm communicate with their local veterinary team, you know,  what their proactive approach to this sort of disease management is going to be.  So yeah, there's that bridge sort of position as well.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:32):**  One other point on it is that there's a question about is it about taking responsibility for  just the animals under your care or is it about taking responsibility for all the animals  involved in that ecosystem, which would include the beneficials like the dung beetles.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:47):**  So if you step back a little bit and think of animals more broadly, that brings a different  perspective.  George, from an arable perspective, you know, obviously they're different parasites that  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:57):**  we're talking about, different diseases, but how do you deal with those in your systems?  If we start just from a disease perspective, I'd say that so many of these diseases are  actually driven by nitrogen and actually really stripping that out of the system.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:10):**  So there's a really fascinating thing whereby these heritage wheat crops that I spoke of  earlier are definitely better at combating disease.  They seem to sometimes get a little disease and they'll kind of cure themselves of it.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:21):**  They regularly cure themselves of rust when they get a bit of yellow rust or something  on the leaves.  But kind of as well as that, the fact that, you know, often these kind of more modern  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:29):**  conventional wheat varieties, if you don't put nitrogen on those, they don't necessarily  perform very well, but they also tend not to get disease.  So a lot of it is about managing that nitrogen and tending towards not necessarily a fully  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:41):**  organic process, but certainly tending towards a more organic form of farming.  But then when we're talking about kind of insect pests, I'd actually say a lot of it's  down to patience and a little bit of trust.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:51):**  And to go zero insecticide, you kind of have to have the balls just to say, you know what,  I'm not going to do anything here because the thresholds, I don't think are particularly  handy.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:59):**  A key example of this happened, it was the final time I ever used an insecticide on the  farm, which was I think six and a half years ago now it would have been.  And it was on a, and I hadn't used them for two years and I've been growing up some beans  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:09):**  and my agronomist insisted that I needed to spray for pea and bean weevil on these because  they were having a, they're notching on the leaves and the beans weren't growing well.  And we've got some pretty decent sized ditches down there, sort of, you know, six meter wide  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:21):**  ditches with wide margins either side.  And I had one small field that I thought, right, well, I'm not going to spray that one,  but I will follow my agronomist's advice and spray the other two.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:28):**  So I sprayed the other two and it was almost an instantaneous effect within a couple of  days that those crops sprung up, looked a lot better.  Oh, fantastic.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:36):**  Okay, well, you know, they're growing well.  The other one still looked a bit behind.  Then all of a sudden, a few days after that went entirely backwards again, tons of pea  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:43):**  and bean weevil again, loads of notching.  And a couple of weeks after that spray, if you looked at the first field that I hadn't  touched, it was head and shoulders better than the ones I'd sprayed.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:52):**  And that was, that was the final thing that I needed to look at and think, you know what,  you do not need to spray these insecticides.  They might kind of look like they do a good job.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:00):**  And the funny thing is, in that scenario, had I sprayed the lot, I would have looked  there and been like, oh, I did a great job.  Oh, now I've got more pests coming in.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:06):**  Oh, better go and spray again.  And it's not, you have to at one point, you have to take that kind of jump off the cliff,  bite the bullet and say, you know what, I'm just not going to use them anymore.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:15):**  And you just have to take your foot off the gas and really kind of embrace the fact that  you're going to get your beneficials coming in.  And I would actually, again, it's just reminded me of a point that we didn't cover in the  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:25):**  sort of animal pest side is that absolutely agree about the fertilisers and these funny  proteins coming right through into the animals as well.  So, you know, things like the face flies and all these mucous membranes are leaking proteins  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:35):**  that might be more attractive to the insects themselves.  So again, it's the whole system treating the whole system, isn't it?  And actually fertilisers are hugely unhelpful in all of that.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:43):**  It's interesting, isn't it?  We spent so much time, you know, since, well, since, since the thirties, I suppose, and  certainly since the Second World War, just trying to second guess nature and, you know,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:52):**  use a chemical to try and deal with this without fully understanding the process because the  process is a hugely complicated and interconnected.  That's all we've got time for.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:38:00):**  Thanks so much, everybody.  You've been fantastic.  So I'd like to thank my guests, Claire Hill, George Young and Caroline Grindrod.

### Farm Gate  (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 16:38:13)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. This is the second of our Regenerative Agriculture  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:10):**  Question Time podcasts, where we gather together experts and farmers working in the regenerative  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:15):**  agriculture space to answer your questions, which have come in, some by Twitter and lots  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:20):**  by email. Today I'm joined by Claire Hill, the Director of Regenerative Agriculture at  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:25):**  FAI Farms, George Young from Fobbing Farm in Essex and Caroline Grindrod from the Regenerative  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:31):**  Agriculture Consultancy, Roots of Nature. I wonder if I could start with a question  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:35):**  from me. Could you just introduce yourselves, tell us where and what you farm and as we're  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:40):**  recording in January and looking forward to spring, could you tell us what your chief  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:45):**  priorities are at this time of year and kind of what takes up most of your time? Claire,  
**[0:00:49-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:49):**  could I come to you first?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:51):**  Yeah, hi. We farm 1200 acres in Oxfordshire. A lot of it floodplain. We do have some higher  
**[0:00:57-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:00:57):**  ground which is heavy clay, which is now our cattle out wintering ground. We've got cattle,  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:02):**  sheep, laying hens and we're looking at the other options to bring more diversity into  
**[0:01:07-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:07):**  the farm this year as far as possible broiler chickens, pigs and some vegetables. And our  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:14):**  time at the moment is mostly taken up with planning on the one hand, so finalising our  
**[0:01:18-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:18):**  grazing plans. We've already done our grazing plans for the whole year, so we know what's  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:22):**  going to be where and what we're trying to factor in now is the parasite burden. We realised  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:27):**  that we use a lot of insecticides on the sheep for treating fly strike, or not treating fly  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:32):**  strike, preventing fly strike I should say. And we're thinking about how can we manage  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:36):**  differently in order to not have to use those products. So that's what's taking up our thinking  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:42):**  time, our physical time at the moment. It's taking up I guess with out wintering cattle.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:48):**  It actually doesn't take as much time as feeding animals in the shed, but that's what we're  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:51):**  doing at the moment. We've got all our calves and cows out wintering. We're just in the  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:01:56):**  process of weaning our cattle. We use a two-stage weaning process, putting nose flaps in for  
**[0:02:02-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:02):**  four or five days and then separating mum and calf after that. But our plan ongoing  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:06):**  is actually to get to the point where we don't wean because we see that now our pastures  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:10):**  are becoming more diverse and our animals are getting more nutrition, not just in the  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:14):**  dry matter and energy sense, but in the trace minerals and other elements sense that actually  
**[0:02:21-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:21):**  they're able to maintain condition much more. And the growth rates we see from the calves  
**[0:02:25-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:25):**  of course, staying with the cow are really positive. So that's what we're kind of physically  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:29):**  doing and thinking about over the next year. Brilliant. And when you talk about out wintering,  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:34):**  they haven't come in yet at all through the winter, have they, your cattle?  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:37):**  No, our finishing animals are in, but our cows and calves are still outside. They haven't  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:43):**  come in at all. We have the building there as a backup because we're in our early stages,  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:47):**  but no, they're still out in the snow as we've got today.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:50):**  Thanks very much. George, tell us about yourself.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:52):**  Well, hello everybody. Yes, I am George Young, aka Farming George on all the social medias.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:02:58):**  And essentially I started off being a conventional farmer about eight years ago, transitioning  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:03):**  very quickly to zero till and zero insecticides. And then from about four, four and a half  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:08):**  years ago, getting even more diverse. So that kind of started off with introducing niche  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:13):**  crops into this system. So previously we'd just been growing wheat,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:17):**  rape and peas, occasionally a bit of barley, maybe a bit of linseed. But then I diversified  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:21):**  into heritage wheat crops. So some fun varieties like Percival's Blue Cone, which is a rivet  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:27):**  wheat for pasta and populations such as Martin Wolf's YQ population. And then also diversifying  
**[0:03:32-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:32):**  into crops like buckwheat, hemp and lentils. Some of those go through the, through Hodnadots,  
**[0:03:39-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:39):**  who I'm sure a lot of people have heard of now. But then in terms of kind of additional  
**[0:03:42-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:42):**  diversity, which I've really been pushing in the past couple of years, we began introducing  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:46):**  herbal lays in 2018. We now have rather a lot of herbal lays. We're overall, we're about  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:51):**  500 hectares and we've got 80 hectares and herbal lays at the moment, which is growing  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:03:55):**  year on year. And I introduced in November, a small herd of red pole cattle. Red poles  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:01):**  are great for me because they're heritage and East Anglian. So they kind of fit into  
**[0:04:06-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:06):**  my ethos of what I want out of the cow, but most importantly, they are dual purpose. So  
**[0:04:10-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:10):**  they're going to be for beef and also for dairy. And I'm actually looking to bolster  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:14):**  my herd even more this spring, which is exciting. And yeah, last November, so a couple of months  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:19):**  ago, I planted a lot of trees, about three and a half thousand. I've got a further 3000  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:24):**  coming next week to plant my willow. So that's for my agroforestry project in 120 hectare  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:30):**  field, all manner of fruit trees, but also some birch for their sugar and also some timber  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:35):**  as well, and some, some wild margins. So that's kind of what I farm on the farm, but what  
**[0:04:39-0:04:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:39):**  I'm up to at the moment in this rather dreary wet winter that we're going through. Where  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:43):**  I farm, we have a lot of problems from quad bikes and from hare courses, which is always  
**[0:04:47-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:47):**  terrifically good fun. So we're doing a lot of security. We've got some fencing to do  
**[0:04:51-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:51):**  in the next couple of weeks and some ditches and bums, the most glamorous of things to  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:04:55):**  do. And I'm actually also then doing an awful lot of research. So we're obviously doing  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:00):**  maintenance but my research this year, which is being somewhat kiboshed by COVID with me  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:05):**  not being able to go and visit people, but the most primary thing is going and finding  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:09):**  people to talk to about dairies and specifically calf foot foot dairies. So I've got some visits  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:14):**  lined up for that. And also for the bakery that I'm looking to hopefully start at the  
**[0:05:18-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:18):**  end of this year as well.  
**[0:05:19-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:19):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:22):**  Well actually primarily, I'm not a farmer. So I run the Roots of Nature consultancy,  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:27):**  which is less of a conventional consultancy. I don't go and tell farms what to do, but  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:32):**  I kind of coach and train in the principles of regenerative, particularly focused on livestock  
**[0:05:37-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:37):**  systems, but regenerative agriculture. I also have an organisation called Wildiculture,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:42):**  which is kind of the application of regenerative agriculture, kind of hybrid between that and  
**[0:05:47-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:47):**  and, you know, regenerative grazing and rewilding in the uplands.  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:51):**  So I'm based in the Lake District, so I tend to work with farms in Scotland, the  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:05:55):**  lakes, Wales, you know, anything hilly basically that can't kind of been easily broken up  
**[0:06:00-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:00):**  into little cells and mob grazed.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:02):**  My kind of day to day, I guess, is partly we have several projects ongoing with that  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:06):**  where we work much, you know, we work over a long term kind of coaching situation where  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:11):**  we help transition those farms to that approach.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:15):**  So I get involved, you know, visiting fairly regularly and talking on the phone to people  
**[0:06:20-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:20):**  quite a lot.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:21):**  I also work with Claire at the FAI and we're also co-developing a range of training, an  
**[0:06:25-0:06:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:25):**  introduction to regenerative agriculture, in fact, sort of for people that in supply  
**[0:06:29-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:29):**  chains and food businesses that may not fully understand what that involves.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:32):**  And then we're also developing a grazing one over, you know, six to eight months, which  
**[0:06:36-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:36):**  is going to really help the businesses.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:38):**  And then I also have a meat business called Primal Meats.  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:40):**  So I kind of have a lot of different fingers in different pies, but they all kind of fit  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:43):**  together under this umbrella of Roots of Nature and, you know, they're trying to evolve, refine  
**[0:06:49-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:49):**  and develop what regenerative agriculture is in the UK.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:51):**  Superb, thanks very much.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:53):**  OK, right.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:54):**  Well, let's get started with a question from Josh on Twitter.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:06:56):**  What does a regen farmer want or need from their vet beyond the usual?  
**[0:07:01-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:01):**  And I guess, Claire, let's come to you first with this.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:04):**  Yeah, well, I want I can't speak for everybody.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:06):**  I still very much want their input.  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:09):**  Rather than here's the ailment, what drugs can we use?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:14):**  What I want is a conversation about what we're trying to achieve, what our holistic context  
**[0:07:18-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:18):**  sets out, where we're trying to get to and and how we might go about about achieving  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:23):**  it.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:24):**  So for us, it would be we want to absolutely maximise the biodiversity on our farm.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:29):**  And therefore, we want our dung beetles and other good insects to be thriving.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:33):**  And so how can the way that we manage our animals make sure that we're doing everything  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:38):**  we can towards achieving that?  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:40):**  So I want to be having conversations like that with with our vets and it's different.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:47):**  And I would say that I'm totally prepared to pay for that advice.  
**[0:07:50-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:50):**  You know, I realise the way that it's currently structured in where the money's made.  
**[0:07:54-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:54):**  And I'm really happy that to flip that.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:56):**  And we do work with our vets in that way.  
**[0:07:58-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:58):**  That's what that's what I want.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:07:59):**  I want a conversation.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:00):**  We definitely still need that expertise, but just reframing it in a slightly different  
**[0:08:05-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:05):**  way.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:06):**  And with what you're doing, what you're talking about there is sort of linking in the management,  
**[0:08:10-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:10):**  having more advice about how to manage prevention of those ailments as much as it is about actually  
**[0:08:16-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:16):**  treating them when they come along.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:18):**  And I know that FAI is working quite closely with vets Sustain as well.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:22):**  Yes, yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:24):**  Yeah, I mean, it's this new new ground for all of us, really.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:28):**  And we're venturing into something different.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:30):**  And therefore, the way that we operate needs to change and the way we interact with each  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:33):**  other needs to change.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:35):**  It's not just about the animals and their specific health.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:37):**  It's what what do we need to achieve on the farm?  
**[0:08:39-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:39):**  And how do we make sure that we maintain the very best health and welfare at the same time?  
**[0:08:43-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:43):**  Caroline?  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:44):**  I completely obviously agree with Claire, we work very closely on it.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:47):**  And I also, one of the directors of Wilder Culture is Alex Tomlinson, who's been on this  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:52):**  show before.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:53):**  And what we do is we approach it as a kind of proactive health planning sense.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:08:57):**  So one of the services and training that she's developing is this kind of idea of yeah, how  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:03):**  do we create overall complexities so that we don't get the booms and busts in population,  
**[0:09:06-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:06):**  which generally cause the issues in the in the health and the animals.  
**[0:09:09-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:09):**  So we would look at creating health plans that fit and knit together with the grazing  
**[0:09:13-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:13):**  plans, as Claire said, just try and sort of stop any of these issues happening in the  
**[0:09:17-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:17):**  first place.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:18):**  And then if you've got problem issues, because every farm has certain species that are an  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:21):**  issue, and you assess the lifecycle of that organism, we call it red flag species, because  
**[0:09:26-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:26):**  it's kind of out of balance.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:27):**  And then you look at the lifecycle, and then you can really specifically build a grazing  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:31):**  plan or management plan around tackling that organism.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:34):**  So for Claire, that was one of the priorities on the farm, wasn't it, you know, absolutely  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:37):**  had to try and tackle the parasite burden.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:40):**  So the grazing plan, the primary objective of the grazing plan was to try and address  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:43):**  that first.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:44):**  So that's how Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:46):**  So any help from vets on, you know, proactively looking at those organisms studying that with  
**[0:09:51-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:51):**  their amazing knowledge, and then applying it to the whole system approach would be brilliant.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:09:56):**  And that's quite a change, isn't it for I think, for a lot of vets, and I think, you  
**[0:10:00-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:00):**  know, there's there's an increasing amount of information out there, isn't there amongst  
**[0:10:03-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:03):**  vet organisations.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:04):**  And of course, that sustain is particularly good at sharing information about how how  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:08):**  vets can work in that space in the future, how potentially they can still make a decent  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:13):**  living, even though the business model for farm vets might change gradually as we as  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:17):**  we move forward.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:18):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:20):**  We've got one here from Liz by email.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:23):**  We've talked a lot about livestock grazing and regenerative agriculture on the podcast.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:29):**  This is a question about Arabborn just says, what are the basic regenerative principles  
**[0:10:32-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:32):**  for growing cereals?  
**[0:10:33-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:33):**  And I guess this is the question that's tailor made for you, George?  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:37):**  Well, I mean, following obviously, the livestock question, there are actually quite a lot of  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:41):**  similarities in actually kind of making sure you're planning your rotation around issues  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:45):**  you're likely to have rather than addressing a problem when you get a problem.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:49):**  And that's certainly kind of the approach that I'm taking.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:51):**  One of the big things for me is is kind of looking at the fact that we know we need beneficial  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:56):**  insects.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:10:57):**  And if you need beneficial insects, I think the very first port of call is saying, right,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:01):**  well, we absolutely cannot use insecticides across the farm, you must stop that.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:04):**  And then it's looking at the fact and saying, right, well, why am I going to have issues  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:07):**  with any pests on my crop in the rest of the system without using that insecticide.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:12):**  And a lot of that is actually then driven by artificial nitrogen.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:15):**  So kind of spikes of nitrogen supply causing issues, so causing cell wall weakness, making  
**[0:11:20-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:20):**  the plants super sugary.  
**[0:11:21-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:21):**  So they're really attractive to those pests.  
**[0:11:23-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:23):**  So it's kind of looking at the overall system and saying, right, so in which case I need  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:26):**  to cut down on my artificial nitrogen, and I need to make sure that I've got a huge amount  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:30):**  of habitat available for my insects to live in.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:33):**  And this is kind of where my agroforestry project kind of came in.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:36):**  And also, you know, about this idea of trying to really interconnect the farm.  
**[0:11:40-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:40):**  So my agroforestry is not just spouts of trees in parallel down a field, it also combines  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:46):**  wild margins in that field that then link those wild margins to a wild seam that connects  
**[0:11:50-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:50):**  the entire farm together.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:52):**  This is a really critical kind of overall farm assessment of how do I make my farm interconnect.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:11:56):**  How do I ensure that there's always somewhere for all insects, small mammals, bigger mammals,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:03):**  and birds of prey to actually kind of exist in an ecosystem to really create that?  
**[0:12:07-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:07):**  And then also, how do I create organic nitrogen in this system?  
**[0:12:10-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:10):**  So actually, as it happens, if you're really going to be a regenerative cereal farmer,  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:15):**  livestock is absolutely critical, because that's how you're going to drive your genuine  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:19):**  fertility in your soil, not your kind of spoon fed fertility that will enable you to have  
**[0:12:23-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:23):**  really strong plants, really strong cereal plants.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:25):**  If they have any kind of issue with a pest coming on board, you know, also, you've got  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:29):**  your habitat there for your beneficials to come and attack that pest and the ecosystem  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:33):**  actually functions.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:34):**  So I think from from growing cereals, that's a kind of rough overview.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:37):**  I think what we really need to create on farm to tackle that and grow cereals regeneratively.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:41):**  Thanks, George.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:42):**  And when we're talking about regenerative principles, what do you feel about soil cover?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:46):**  Is that something that you're constantly trying to make sure that it's not left bare at any  
**[0:12:50-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:50):**  time?  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:51):**  Yeah, so soil cover is a very important one.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:53):**  It's just so many people bash on about cover crops now.  
**[0:12:55-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:55):**  I mean, ironically, there's obviously a question about tillage as well.  
**[0:12:59-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:12:59):**  And and I think there's obviously an argument there then between the people who want something  
**[0:13:02-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:02):**  entirely organic and those people who want something entirely zero till.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:05):**  And I'm certainly someone who's migrated from a viewpoint of wanting glyphosate and genuine  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:11):**  zero tillage to a perspective now where I actually feel like not using glyphosate in  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:16):**  any pesticides and using a small amount of tillage is a better overall system, but only  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:21):**  on the proviso that you have a very, very large area of your farm under permanent organic  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:26):**  cover, which is never, ever disturbed and provided you also keep that window of tillage  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:30):**  very, very small and ensure that you get crops established in it, either a cover crop or  
**[0:13:34-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:34):**  a cash crop established in that ground as soon as you possibly can.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:37):**  Really interesting as a huge amount of thought and research that you're clearly going into  
**[0:13:41-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:41):**  on your farm, which is which is fascinating.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:43):**  I've got a question here.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:44):**  I'm going to toss this over to Caroline.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:46):**  I think a question from Pippa by email came in by email.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:49):**  I want to move towards an out wintering system, but my land is heavy clay, so the cattle would  
**[0:13:55-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:55):**  just trash it.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:56):**  Any thoughts?  
**[0:13:57-0:14:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:13:57):**  Yeah, so I live in I live in an area of Britain that gets two metres of rain a year or so.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:03):**  We're very familiar with very wet ground and also heavy clay ground.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:07):**  And I work, as I said, with a few key projects, all of which started with the idea that there's  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:11):**  absolutely no other way that we could out winter.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:13):**  And I think the key thing is it's all about planning ahead.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:16):**  So if you and a lot of farmers, what you introduce this concept to are just looking at their  
**[0:14:20-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:20):**  fields in the middle of winter that are short grazed down, you can see the soil and you  
**[0:14:24-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:24):**  can imagine the mess if you just turned a herd of cattle in there and they all stood  
**[0:14:26-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:26):**  round to be able, you know, which is what you tend to see.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:28):**  And everyone has this kind of very negative association with out wintering.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:31):**  But to do it out wintering properly, you need to be planning kind of, you know, a year ahead  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:35):**  like Claire's planning her grazing, you know, you know, a long way ahead.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:39):**  And you need to design the entire system around ensuring that you've got enough ground, the  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:42):**  right ground in the right, you know, the right place and that you've allowed it to grow long  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:46):**  enough so that you've got deep roots, tall grass that's going to be able to provide a  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:50):**  kind of a thatchy protective surface and that you're allocating it in a way that means that  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:55):**  they're not hanging around in the same place and poaching it.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:14:57):**  So they might only be in there for two or three days depends on the grounds depends  
**[0:15:01-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:01):**  on the context depends on the system.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:02):**  So there's no fixed way of doing this.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:04):**  But absolutely, it's certainly not a case of just expecting to be able to turn a lot  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:08):**  of animals into an area in the middle of winter at work.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:10):**  It's not that at all.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:12):**  And also just to make sure that people understand regardless of what soil type you've got, you  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:15):**  can improve the structure.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:16):**  So clay could be one of the best potential soils and you know, textures to work with  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:21):**  over the long term.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:22):**  But you know, you need to start that soil structure building processes and allowing  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:26):**  long recovery periods that then go into out wintering is a really great way of doing that.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:30):**  And then of course, the sort of trampling and littering and then a long rest period  
**[0:15:33-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:33):**  again, you know, is a really great way of accelerating soil structure and having that  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:37):**  benefit so that over time, it will hold up against poaching much, much better.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:42):**  And if you do get a little bit poaching, it's like not the end of the world because you  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:44):**  know, as long as you have a long recovery period, it's usually recovered.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:47):**  And in some cases that allows little, you know, the seed bed to be stimulated and species  
**[0:15:52-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:52):**  to appear that might not have done had you just been, you know, gently set stocking it.  
**[0:15:56-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:56):**  So planning ahead, absolutely critical.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:15:58):**  But you know, Claire's gone through this process as well.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:00):**  So any tips she's got or thoughts on that?  
**[0:16:03-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:03):**  And what I was sort of taking from there as well is, you know, rest.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:06):**  Rest is the most powerful tool in the toolbox.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:09):**  Before I come to you Claire, I'm going to come to another question, but perhaps you  
**[0:16:12-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:12):**  can link the two.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:13):**  There's another livestock question, this one from Bill in the Northwest by email.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:17):**  How do you deal with rushes?  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:19):**  My land is wet and the rushes are just getting worse each year.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:23):**  We also have rushes, although we don't get the rainfall that Caroline and others are  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:27):**  getting, but we are, we do manage quite a large area of floodplain.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:31):**  And so we do have rushes down there and we're organic.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:34):**  So we used to just top them and it sort of worked, but they're still growing and you  
**[0:16:38-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:38):**  know, a bit creeping out, getting more and more each year.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:41):**  But since we've, since we started raising in this way of which I would totally agree,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:46):**  rest, it feels it's totally counterintuitive.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:49):**  Like it should be the more I graze, the more grass I'm getting from it, but actually the  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:52):**  more you graze, the more diversity that comes and that's more nutritious for the animals  
**[0:16:56-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:56):**  and then they eat less and so on and so on.  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:16:58):**  So what we, what we are doing on our system is we aim to graze, rest everything for between  
**[0:17:03-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:03):**  three and six months.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:05):**  And then we use the animals as a tool.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:07):**  So on our rushy areas, we might put them in slightly smaller areas so that they really  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:11):**  went in and broke up some of those rushes.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:14):**  And then with that, and with the impact of the urine and dung kickstarting the soil biology  
**[0:17:21-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:21):**  with the action of trampling and then along rest period, those conditions become really  
**[0:17:25-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:25):**  favourable in the soil biology for other species to thrive.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:29):**  And bit by bit, the rushes go, rushes are an indicator species that soil biology isn't  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:34):**  happy.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:35):**  And so it's a case of adjusting our conditions to make it less favourable.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:39):**  So is that about succession?  
**[0:17:40-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:40):**  It's about, you know, the rushes, they're there because the conditions are right for  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:44):**  them and so you just got to change the conditions effectively.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:47):**  Yeah, they're mother nature's way of holding the soil together, keeping everything going.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:51):**  What, in the absence of anything else, when the conditions start to change and there's  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:17:56):**  more action in the soil, the biology is less favourable for the rushes to grow.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:00):**  Do you have any additional thoughts, Claire, on the, on the heavy clay question?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:03):**  Yeah, so I lost count of the number of people that have said, you know, you're never out  
**[0:18:07-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:07):**  winter on this farm, you're crazy.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:09):**  And it took us a few years to get the confidence in which to do it.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:12):**  But then we spoke to other farmers who had had the same thing said to them.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:16):**  And now we say the same thing to others.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:18):**  The key thing is, is moving them every day.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:21):**  So not every day, sorry, we would we would work on about an every two day move, but you  
**[0:18:26-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:26):**  know, two to three days, so they're not in one area for too long.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:28):**  And that's key.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:29):**  We couldn't out winter where we just turn them out all winter, and then stay on the  
**[0:18:33-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:33):**  same area.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:34):**  And the great thing about that is that you might have a field 10 or 20 acres, and you're  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:38):**  grazing that first cell, it might take a month or so even more to get all the way across  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:43):**  the field.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:44):**  But that means that first cell has had already one month of rest by the time that animals  
**[0:18:48-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:48):**  get to the other side of the field.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:49):**  And that's key is that moving them on frequently.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:52):**  We use bales as well to give them extra fodder, because we're not growing as much as we need  
**[0:18:56-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:56):**  yet.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:57):**  But moving frequently is the key.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:18:59):**  George, you're arable rather than livestock, but how do you deal with?  
**[0:19:03-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:03):**  I guess I guess the issue is particularly wet spaces.  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:05):**  Well, I mean, if I was going to say traditionally what we would have done, when I mean, when  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:10):**  I first came back to the farm, Dad was busy getting some additional drains, land drains  
**[0:19:14-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:14):**  put in on some some wet patches on a couple of fields.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:18):**  And ironically, they haven't worked very well.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:19):**  And either they weren't put in well in the first place, or maybe we shouldn't be land  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:22):**  draining it.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:23):**  And I think this really comes down to just looking at why you've got those wet patches.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:28):**  And is there really that much gain from actually bothering to underdrain those areas?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:33):**  Sometimes I think it's better to kind of assess your farm that you can actually even go online  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:37):**  and see kind of old maps, 150, 160 year old maps you can find online and overlay over  
**[0:19:42-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:42):**  Google and like see, see what was going on in your farm at the time and kind of just  
**[0:19:46-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:46):**  assess and think, well, do I want to be thrashing the hell out my farm?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:49):**  Do I want to spend a load more money on land drainage?  
**[0:19:51-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:51):**  Or do we instead say, you know what, we've got a wet patch here where I am, we've got  
**[0:19:54-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:54):**  a few springs in a few fields, they cause wet patches.  
**[0:19:57-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:57):**  They're not big enough to worry about.  
**[0:19:58-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:19:58):**  But I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, I've got a spring there.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:01):**  Well, why don't we have a bit of a pond and allow nature to occur in that area and just  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:06):**  farm around?  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:07):**  Let's stop worrying about having large square fields where we farm everything, but instead  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:11):**  actually be a little bit more sympathetic to nature and let it have those spaces that  
**[0:20:15-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:15):**  just aren't that productive.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:16):**  And when you're talking about needing to rebuild insect populations and so on, of course, those  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:20):**  are highly productive places for that to happen.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:22):**  Yeah, precisely.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:23):**  There's this whole worry that kind of we've been kind of drilled into us that if you have  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:27):**  wet spots there, they end up being really compacted and anaerobic.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:30):**  And that's where your black grass starts, which is true because you probably shouldn't  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:34):**  be cropping them.  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:35):**  So don't crop them.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:36):**  Don't get the black grass problem there.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:38):**  Don't take that black grass problem from that area out into the rest of your field.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:41):**  Only crop the area of your field that is nicely aerobic and leave those areas to be there  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:46):**  exactly for those other wildlife that we want on the farm.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:49):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:50):**  Thank you.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:51):**  Well, here's a quick one.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:52):**  And I think I'm going to have a go at answering this one myself because it's probably my area.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:20:55):**  So a question from Dave at home on Twitter says, is it possible to calculate and publish  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:00):**  climate impact figures, e.g. some sort of CO2 equivalent for each crop and animal product?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:06):**  Well, I'm just going to go through this.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:09):**  And I'd say the simple answer is that this sort of information has been calculated by  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:13):**  various academics over the last decade or so.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:15):**  But the real question is, is this actually helpful?  
**[0:21:17-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:17):**  And to my mind, the answer is no.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:19):**  And in fact, it can be extremely misleading.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:22):**  For example, at a global level, using the old GWP 100 metric for measuring the carbon  
**[0:21:28-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:28):**  impact, beef, cattle and sheep will come out badly.  
**[0:21:31-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:31):**  But when they're reared in regenerative systems with integrated agroforestry in there as well,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:35):**  perhaps at five or 10 percent, then the impact is calculated using GWP star, which accurately  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:41):**  accounts for the warming impact of the methane.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:44):**  Then ruminant farming can actually become carbon positive with the farm system sequestering  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:48):**  more carbon than it produces, which seems very counterintuitive when we're looking at  
**[0:21:53-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:53):**  these global figures.  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:54):**  But what really matters is that we move away from these global averages, take them with  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:21:58):**  a relative pinch of salt and think about what matters, which is the individual impact of  
**[0:22:03-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:03):**  each and every farm.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:04):**  So really, carbon footprinting with GWP star really ought to be a basic entry level requirement  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:10):**  for every farm these days.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:12):**  That's my view.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:13):**  Anybody got any alternative or different thoughts on that?  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:16):**  I completely agree with you, Finn Law.  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:18):**  You know, I think we just need to get away from this idea of this global diet that's  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:21):**  based on mechanistic calculations and look at, OK, well, actually, you know, it's giving  
**[0:22:26-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:26):**  us a false choice.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:27):**  We need to look at what can we produce in each region?  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:30):**  What's appropriate for the landscape?  
**[0:22:31-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:31):**  What's appropriate for the people?  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:32):**  You know, we don't have each individual farm is owned by individuals with individual needs.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:36):**  And it's absolutely right that we should it should be contextual.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:39):**  So we need to look at, OK, what can we do here?  
**[0:22:42-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:42):**  Focus on that.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:43):**  It's about nutrition.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:44):**  It's not just about calories.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:45):**  There's so much to this question, as you say, we could go into it.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:47):**  But ultimately, I think it's extremely unhelpful to try and take a global approach to fixing  
**[0:22:52-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:52):**  that.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:53):**  The next question's linked, I suppose, to this.  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:54):**  And I think, George, I get asked this really pretty frequently in various forms.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:22:58):**  And this time the questions come in by email from Brian in Staffordshire.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:02):**  He says, regenerative agriculture is great, but do you really think that it can feed the  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:07):**  world when the population is expected to be 10 billion by 2050?  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:10):**  Well, I kind of love this question.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:13):**  And Caroline just used two very fantastic specific words associated with this, which  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:18):**  are calories and nutrition.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:20):**  So I put it down to that there are two really simple examples I can use here.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:24):**  The problem is we're focusing this when people ask this question, they focus on the farmer.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:28):**  That's the wrong thing to be looking at.  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:29):**  We need to be looking at the food system that we as farmers feed into.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:32):**  The first one we look at is to say, cereal production.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:35):**  And specifically, let's talk about wheat and the staff of life, which is bread.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:38):**  Now the funny thing is, so when I'm growing my heritage crops of wheat, I'm growing sort  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:42):**  of three and a half, maybe four tonne a hectare.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:45):**  I can't get these super high flying tonnages that people get on their large scale conventional  
**[0:23:50-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:50):**  farms.  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:51):**  But the funny thing is, let's say that that person who's who's yielding 10, 12 tonne of  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:54):**  milling wheat every single year, unfortunately, where that wheat is going into, it's going  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:23:58):**  into a process where it's being roller milled, which basically splits the wheat up to form  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:04):**  just a very kind of stable white flour that doesn't have any of the brown or any of the  
**[0:24:09-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:09):**  germs and none of the oils in that wheat are there.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:12):**  All you've got is essentially the calorific content of the wheat grain in that flour.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:17):**  And it then is made into bread in something called the Chorley Wood process, which essentially  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:20):**  makes a loaf of bread in something like 40 or 50 minutes.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:24):**  It goes from flour to bread in that amount of time.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:26):**  And it uses a tonne of yeast.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:28):**  And basically, a lot of that yeast is then still active in the final bread product and  
**[0:24:32-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:32):**  the gluten hasn't been broken down in the bread.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:34):**  So these are a lot of reasons as to why we're having tummy problems eating breads like this.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:38):**  And also because it's been made so quickly, it hasn't had time to make the nutrition in  
**[0:24:43-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:43):**  that flour, what nutrition there is in that less nutritious flour, hasn't had the time  
**[0:24:47-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:47):**  to make that nutrition bioavailable.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:49):**  So instead, eating a loaf of Chorley Wood bread is the equivalent of just eating calories.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:54):**  So someone might have grown a fantastic crop, you know, 12 tonne crop of wheat, but all  
**[0:24:58-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:58):**  it's doing is fattening people.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:24:59):**  It's not actually nourishing them.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:01):**  My, you know, my system where I'm growing three and a half to four tonne of wheat, going  
**[0:25:04-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:04):**  through a stone milling process, which keeps everything involved in that.  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:07):**  So even if you choose a sifted flour, you still have a lot of the oils, which means  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:11):**  that that flour product has got a shelf life, it must be used.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:14):**  But if that's then going into a sourdough process of bread making, that long fermentation  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:18):**  time with natural yeasts allows the gluten strands to be broken down, allows all the  
**[0:25:22-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:22):**  yeast to die off.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:24):**  The gluten is actually a different form in heritage products, in heritage wheats anyway.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:28):**  And suddenly you end up with a product in that sourdough loaf where the nutrition is  
**[0:25:32-0:25:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:32):**  two and a half to three times more bioavailable to a human than in the Chorley Wood loaf.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:37):**  So it's just a context of actually what do we mean by feed the world?  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:41):**  Do we mean that everyone gets to eat three and a half, four thousand calories of food  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:44):**  a day?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:45):**  Or do we mean that people actually get to eat two thousand calories of really nutritionally  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:48):**  high quality food, which is then going to fix a huge number of issues we've then got  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:53):**  with the health system, all the diet related diseases, obesity, all those problems get  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:25:58):**  fixed by the fact that actually if we ensure our food system is fixed and then we supply  
**[0:26:03-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:03):**  the correct product for that food system, we're then going to end up with a healthy  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:06):**  population that is not only fed, but also nourished.  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:09):**  So taking, I mean, I'm fascinated by what you say as someone who eats an awful lot of  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:13):**  toast.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:14):**  But I think the short answer to the question of whether you think it can feed the world,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:18):**  you know, by 2050 is yes, definitely.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:21):**  Yeah, like without a shadow of a doubt.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:23):**  And I actually even believe that we can feed the world with considerably less land use  
**[0:26:28-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:28):**  than we are currently doing for agriculture at the moment.  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:30):**  And we actually have the ability to free up land in the UK for actual genuine flood management,  
**[0:26:35-0:26:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:35):**  you know, taking land out of production that's on the water meadows, put those water meadows  
**[0:26:40-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:40):**  back, have room to actually bring back in keystone species that were eradicated in the  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:44):**  UK centuries ago, species like beavers and plenty of others, potentially room for links.  
**[0:26:49-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:49):**  And that's like a really key way if we can really fix this food system, we also get the  
**[0:26:53-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:53):**  chance to actually genuinely fix our ecological system to generally begin to reverse the biodiversity  
**[0:26:59-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:26:59):**  loss that we're seeing at the moment.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:00):**  So again, for you, I guess the, you know, the critical part of that is using land for  
**[0:27:04-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:04):**  what it what it should be used for what it's what it's appropriate to be used for, rather  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:08):**  than forcing it into production, you know, which is only possible because of because  
**[0:27:12-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:12):**  of chemicals and and and intensity.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:15):**  And I guess it's worth mentioning at this point, the food farming and countryside commissions  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:18):**  farming for change report, which addresses this question directly.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:23):**  So what the FFCC have done is to use the IDRI modelling that was used EU wide and applied  
**[0:27:29-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:29):**  it to Britain specifically.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:31):**  And they found that, you know, we can feed ourselves perfectly well with a wholly agro  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:35):**  ecological approach to agriculture.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:38):**  And in fact, you know, as you said, we'd be healthier to there'd be better nutrition coming  
**[0:27:42-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:42):**  out of that, but that our approach to food would have to change.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:45):**  And I think, you know, your, your story there, George sort of clearly indicated that as well  
**[0:27:51-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:51):**  greater diversity coming through better use of, you know, proper nutritional food being  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:27:56):**  grown rather than just calories being grown people eating more legumes and vegetables,  
**[0:28:01-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:01):**  less meat and dairy, particularly less chicken and pork because the emphasis is on producing  
**[0:28:05-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:05):**  land appropriate food.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:07):**  So you know, I urge people to have a look look up that report the farming for change  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:10):**  report from the food farming and countryside commission.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:12):**  It is excellent.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:13):**  Okay, moving on, we have a question from John King, the Connemara farmer on Twitter.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:17):**  He says, can you suggest non chemical preferably biological methods of parasite control, specifically  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:23):**  attacking the lifecycle of parasites like ticks, blow fly, liver flute worms, given  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:28):**  that I'm at a wet farm, fencing off places just isn't an option.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:32):**  Who's going to go first on this?  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:34):**  Caroline, can I come to you?  
**[0:28:36-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:36):**  Yeah, so it kind of loops back into what we were saying already, actually, about parasites  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:39):**  and red flag species is that actually, maybe what we shouldn't be doing as much and it's  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:44):**  certainly interesting to look at the individual organism, but instead of thinking, how do  
**[0:28:48-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:48):**  I kill that organism, I think you need to broaden the thinking out to think how do we  
**[0:28:51-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:51):**  design a system that means that the organism isn't thriving.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:55):**  So actually, it's not just about finding a kind of less toxic way of killing.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:28:58):**  It's about finding ways of promoting diversity and complexity in the system so that we don't  
**[0:29:03-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:03):**  get the booming and busting of those individual populations.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:06):**  So it's firstly looking at a kind of a design that is, you know, considering the whole but  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:11):**  if you've got problems, species like tick and fluke, which is something that we deal  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:14):**  with a lot in our parts of the world, and then absolutely be about back to those long  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:20):**  rest periods, looking at those life cycles, what other organisms are going to eat those  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:25):**  so for instance, tick, what has happened in the upland environment particularly is that  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:29):**  you've got a lot of burning going on in the heather areas, you've got a very large number  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:34):**  of, you know, set stock raised sheep and deer, there are hosts all year round that sort of  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:39):**  boosted the population.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:41):**  And there's nothing attacking that insect.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:43):**  So the things that sort of regulate the tick are kind of spiders and wasps and those are  
**[0:29:49-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:49):**  actually damaged by things like burning and set stock raising and lack of diversity.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:53):**  So we need to be looking at why is that booming?  
**[0:29:56-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:56):**  And it'll be many different reasons.  
**[0:29:57-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:57):**  It's never just one.  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:29:59):**  And how do we sort of proactively manage?  
**[0:30:01-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:01):**  So for instance, on the wilde culture projects, we'll be looking at, okay, where are the tickiest  
**[0:30:04-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:04):**  areas at what times of the year?  
**[0:30:06-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:06):**  Let's not be there.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:07):**  So we would look at how do we create better structure in our upland environment with taller  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:12):**  vegetation so spiders can thrive and birds can thrive.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:15):**  And so we very much take that proactive approach.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:18):**  We look at the breeds of animals that we're keeping, so they're not going to be as impacted  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:21):**  by those species.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:22):**  So we select for the ones that are doing best.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:24):**  And so we take a whole system approach to trying to tackle that particular organism.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:28):**  So yeah, just let's focus less on the organism, study it, find out where its weak spots are,  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:33):**  and then think about the whole system.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:34):**  How can we design something that's going to kind of reduce its impact and balance it out?  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:39):**  I'm trying to find ways of summarising that into a sort of few key bullet points.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:44):**  And I mean, the things I've written down, they're sort of encouraging the insects and  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:47):**  birds that predate on things like the snails that carry the liver fluke parasite, that  
**[0:30:52-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:52):**  kind of thing.  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:53):**  Somebody on Twitter the other day was talking about having ducks and geese integrated in  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:30:56):**  the system because they love gobbling up those sorts of things.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:00):**  Having higher grasses so that the animal's heads are higher, they're not eating so low  
**[0:31:06-0:31:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:06):**  down where things like fluke again would insist themselves.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:11):**  And having heavy impact to try and bring up the diversity from the ground, from things  
**[0:31:16-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:16):**  like mob grazing, is that a fair summary?  
**[0:31:18-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:18):**  I think that's an excellent summary, absolutely.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:21):**  And I think the other thing to mention is rather than, again, when you do have to respond  
**[0:31:25-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:25):**  to a parasite infestation or whatever it is, try and find the least toxic way of doing  
**[0:31:31-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:31):**  it so that you're not just damaging the entire ecosystem that's keeping the thing in balance.  
**[0:31:35-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:35):**  So I mentioned dung beetles and things earlier, you know, and, you know, anything from face  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:39):**  flies to parasites.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:42):**  We've essentially damaged through our response to trying to treat that.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:46):**  All of the things that are actually regulating it.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:48):**  So it's a case of how do we build a system so it's more complex and stops the booming  
**[0:31:51-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:51):**  of that population?  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:53):**  And then how do we respond to the inevitable, you know, issues that we've got in a less  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:57):**  toxic way?  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:31:59):**  And I'm trying to address all of it.  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:00):**  Claire, I wonder if you have anything to add to that?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:02):**  I would agree with everything.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:03):**  And it's been an interesting year as we've tried to get our head around thinking in this  
**[0:32:09-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:09):**  way.  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:10):**  And the example for us this summer has been that we don't get it very often.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:13):**  But this year we had a real problem with New Forest Eye.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:17):**  And of course, initially it was just about treating it and getting those animals better  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:21):**  as quickly as possible and trying to minimize the spread of infection.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:25):**  But then what we did as a farm team that we've never done before was sit down and do this  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:29):**  red flag kind of deep dive to try and find the root cause.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:32):**  So why did it happen?  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:33):**  How did it happen?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:34):**  And we just kept asking why every time we got to a well, it's because the flies got  
**[0:32:39-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:39):**  to the cows in the world because the cows are on the river meadow and there's more flies.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:42):**  And it's like, well, most of our summer grazing is river meadow.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:46):**  So why, why, why?  
**[0:32:47-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:47):**  And we worked out that really looking at the life cycle of the fly that causes New Forest  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:54):**  Eye that actually the predators of that are things like dung beetles.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:32:58):**  And so our answer is that actually we need to create more dung beetles to eat the flies  
**[0:33:01-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:01):**  more quickly, eat the fly larvae so they don't become flies and they don't get around the  
**[0:33:06-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:06):**  cattle so much.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:07):**  That's hence my reference earlier to thinking about the different insecticides we're using  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:11):**  with the sheep.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:12):**  So that's just a kind of worked example that we've experienced over this last year.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:16):**  And that's almost taking us sort of full circle back to that first question about vets because,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:20):**  you know, that's the kind of thing that, you know, obviously farmers like yourselves can  
**[0:33:24-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:24):**  share that information, but vets could be fantastic hosts of that information and could  
**[0:33:30-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:30):**  share that information as well.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:31):**  And it feels like, you know, you probably at FAI had vets that were part of that conversation  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:35):**  with you.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:36):**  And so having that advice coming from vets at the same time as having the experience  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:40):**  of farmers should be really helpful moving those sort of conversations forward.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:44):**  Yeah, we kind of work in two ways with vets, I guess.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:47):**  We work with vet sustain because we're looking at kind of how do we change things, what needs  
**[0:33:51-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:51):**  to happen, what does regenerative veterinary look like?  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:54):**  And then we also day to day as a farm, we have our farm vets and so we're working in  
**[0:33:59-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:33:59):**  and bringing those into the conversation.  
**[0:34:02-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:02):**  It's really interesting and that's where we get kind of those two strands of advice from.  
**[0:34:06-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:06):**  One other point just to make on the vet side actually is that I think another role for  
**[0:34:10-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:10):**  regenerative vets, if you like, is to feed into sort of the conventional vets where that  
**[0:34:14-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:14):**  is necessary so that they understand the plan that you're running.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:17):**  So it's kind of acting as a bridge, you know, so Alex can help us through wildeiculture  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:22):**  design plans and then help the farm communicate with their local veterinary team, you know,  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:27):**  what their proactive approach to this sort of disease management is going to be.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:30):**  So yeah, there's that bridge sort of position as well.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:32):**  One other point on it is that there's a question about is it about taking responsibility for  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:39):**  just the animals under your care or is it about taking responsibility for all the animals  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:43):**  involved in that ecosystem, which would include the beneficials like the dung beetles.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:47):**  So if you step back a little bit and think of animals more broadly, that brings a different  
**[0:34:53-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:53):**  perspective.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:54):**  George, from an arable perspective, you know, obviously they're different parasites that  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:34:57):**  we're talking about, different diseases, but how do you deal with those in your systems?  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:01):**  If we start just from a disease perspective, I'd say that so many of these diseases are  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:06):**  actually driven by nitrogen and actually really stripping that out of the system.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:10):**  So there's a really fascinating thing whereby these heritage wheat crops that I spoke of  
**[0:35:14-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:14):**  earlier are definitely better at combating disease.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:16):**  They seem to sometimes get a little disease and they'll kind of cure themselves of it.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:21):**  They regularly cure themselves of rust when they get a bit of yellow rust or something  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:24):**  on the leaves.  
**[0:35:25-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:25):**  But kind of as well as that, the fact that, you know, often these kind of more modern  
**[0:35:29-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:29):**  conventional wheat varieties, if you don't put nitrogen on those, they don't necessarily  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:33):**  perform very well, but they also tend not to get disease.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:37):**  So a lot of it is about managing that nitrogen and tending towards not necessarily a fully  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:41):**  organic process, but certainly tending towards a more organic form of farming.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:45):**  But then when we're talking about kind of insect pests, I'd actually say a lot of it's  
**[0:35:48-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:48):**  down to patience and a little bit of trust.  
**[0:35:51-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:51):**  And to go zero insecticide, you kind of have to have the balls just to say, you know what,  
**[0:35:55-0:35:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:55):**  I'm not going to do anything here because the thresholds, I don't think are particularly  
**[0:35:58-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:58):**  handy.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:35:59):**  A key example of this happened, it was the final time I ever used an insecticide on the  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:02):**  farm, which was I think six and a half years ago now it would have been.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:05):**  And it was on a, and I hadn't used them for two years and I've been growing up some beans  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:09):**  and my agronomist insisted that I needed to spray for pea and bean weevil on these because  
**[0:36:14-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:14):**  they were having a, they're notching on the leaves and the beans weren't growing well.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:17):**  And we've got some pretty decent sized ditches down there, sort of, you know, six meter wide  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:21):**  ditches with wide margins either side.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:23):**  And I had one small field that I thought, right, well, I'm not going to spray that one,  
**[0:36:26-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:26):**  but I will follow my agronomist's advice and spray the other two.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:28):**  So I sprayed the other two and it was almost an instantaneous effect within a couple of  
**[0:36:32-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:32):**  days that those crops sprung up, looked a lot better.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:35):**  Oh, fantastic.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:36):**  Okay, well, you know, they're growing well.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:37):**  The other one still looked a bit behind.  
**[0:36:39-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:39):**  Then all of a sudden, a few days after that went entirely backwards again, tons of pea  
**[0:36:43-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:43):**  and bean weevil again, loads of notching.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:45):**  And a couple of weeks after that spray, if you looked at the first field that I hadn't  
**[0:36:49-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:49):**  touched, it was head and shoulders better than the ones I'd sprayed.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:52):**  And that was, that was the final thing that I needed to look at and think, you know what,  
**[0:36:55-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:55):**  you do not need to spray these insecticides.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:36:57):**  They might kind of look like they do a good job.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:00):**  And the funny thing is, in that scenario, had I sprayed the lot, I would have looked  
**[0:37:03-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:03):**  there and been like, oh, I did a great job.  
**[0:37:04-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:04):**  Oh, now I've got more pests coming in.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:06):**  Oh, better go and spray again.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:08):**  And it's not, you have to at one point, you have to take that kind of jump off the cliff,  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:12):**  bite the bullet and say, you know what, I'm just not going to use them anymore.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:15):**  And you just have to take your foot off the gas and really kind of embrace the fact that  
**[0:37:19-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:19):**  you're going to get your beneficials coming in.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:21):**  And I would actually, again, it's just reminded me of a point that we didn't cover in the  
**[0:37:25-0:37:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:25):**  sort of animal pest side is that absolutely agree about the fertilisers and these funny  
**[0:37:29-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:29):**  proteins coming right through into the animals as well.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:31):**  So, you know, things like the face flies and all these mucous membranes are leaking proteins  
**[0:37:35-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:35):**  that might be more attractive to the insects themselves.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:37):**  So again, it's the whole system treating the whole system, isn't it?  
**[0:37:40-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:40):**  And actually fertilisers are hugely unhelpful in all of that.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:43):**  It's interesting, isn't it?  
**[0:37:44-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:44):**  We spent so much time, you know, since, well, since, since the thirties, I suppose, and  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:48):**  certainly since the Second World War, just trying to second guess nature and, you know,  
**[0:37:52-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:52):**  use a chemical to try and deal with this without fully understanding the process because the  
**[0:37:56-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:56):**  process is a hugely complicated and interconnected.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:37:59):**  That's all we've got time for.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Regen-Question-Time-2---Arable--livestock-eppgid#t=0:38:00):**  Thanks so much, everybody.

### Farm Gate  (2020-11-17)  
### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Costayne. In this programme, I'm crossing  the English Channel, which seems to have become emotionally much wider since the UK left the  European Union. What's been happening on the continent, as we Brits used to call mainland  
**[0:00:20-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:20):**  Europe? The Common Agricultural Policy has been going through its latest round of reforms,  while parallel processes have been instigated to deliver sustainable food from farm to fork.  Nick Jacobs is the director of IPES Food, and Pierre-Marie Aubert is the coordinator  
**[0:00:36-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:36):**  of the European Agriculture Initiative for IDDRI. And they're my guests today. Hello  both. Hello all. Hello Finnlow, thanks for inviting  me. Yeah, so I'm Pierre-Marie Aubert working at IDRI. IDRI stands for the Institute for  
**[0:00:50-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:50):**  Sustainable Development and International Relations. We are a small think tank based  in Paris working on sustainable development policies. And as you said, I'm coordinating  the initiative on European agriculture. Basically, we work on scenario towards an agro-ecological  
**[0:01:07-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:07):**  transition trying to combine biophysical dimension, which is biodiversity, climate, socio economic  dimensions and the political economy of the transition.  Thank you Nick. So I work for IPES Food that stands for the  
**[0:01:20-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:20):**  International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems. This is a panel that was set  up in 2015. And it brings together about 25 experts from a range of different disciplines.  So you have agronomists, sociologists, political scientists working together with leading  
**[0:01:37-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:37):**  practitioners from civil society and social movements to come forward with recommendations  on how to reform food systems globally. We've also looked in detail at European policies.  And that's really been a focus through my career. And I started out in Brussels as a  
**[0:01:51-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:51):**  journalist working on the Common Agricultural Policy, which unfortunately doesn't look very  different today to what it did then about 10 years ago.  Thanks for that. I think that's that's almost the end of the programme. It doesn't look  
**[0:02:01-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:01):**  any different, everybody. Thanks very much for those those introductions. Nick, let's  let's just start, if I may, with some nuts and bolts. You know, some of the listeners,  I guess, you know, won't be entirely familiar with the Common Agricultural Policy and what  
**[0:02:14-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:14):**  it is. So what is the Common Agricultural Policy? How does the cap reform process work?  You know, briefly, and at this point, do we know when the new cap is likely to take effect?  I think it's been delayed by COVID. What's going on?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:29):**  The Common Agricultural Policy is one of the EU's oldest policies, one of its foundational  policies. And when it came into force in the 1950s and 60s, the original goal was to deliver  food security in the post-war context. And those goals and objectives have evolved since  
**[0:02:46-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:46):**  then. It's now a policy that primarily provides financial support to farmers. I think it's  seen by most people now as an income support policy. It also regulates how farmers can  produce food and it regulates agricultural markets.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:00):**  And the budget, I mean, at one point, it was nearly half of the EU's budget, and it's now  down to about a third.  It was. It's now closer to 30%. And that's really reflecting the different priorities  
**[0:03:10-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:10):**  that have come onto the table recently, notably immigration and higher research budgets. So  the cap process then is long and complex. And there are lots of inter-institutional  battles between the different institutions based in Brussels. It starts with the European  
**[0:03:25-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:25):**  Commission that makes proposals. Then you have the European Parliament committees that  make amendments to those proposals. You have the groups in the parliament trying to form  agreement. And then at the same time, you have the governments and the agricultural  
**[0:03:37-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:37):**  ministers from the 27 EU member states trying to reach an agreement in the council. The  European Parliament then votes on amendments in its plenary sessions. But in reality, what  we've seen this time is actually the three big political groups in the parliament, the  
**[0:03:51-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:51):**  socialist group, the EPP conservative group and the liberal group Renew, have been able  to kind of reach a consensus on their own, something some people are calling a stitcher.  So you really you have that agreement in the parliament, then the council will agree on  
**[0:04:05-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:05):**  its own approach. And then eventually you have something called trial logs, which we're  going to be entering shortly, where the three institutions get together behind closed doors  and try to hammer out some final compromises. And just to clarify, the cap was already meant  
**[0:04:17-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:17):**  to be in place. At this point, we're in an extension period. So it's still the old cap,  the pre 2020 cap that's in place now and is running under an extension.  And why is that?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:27):**  It's primarily because the institutions didn't manage to reach an agreement before the last  commission and the last parliament came to the end of their mandates in 2019. So the  dossier is it's always complicated. It was even more complicated this time. And it was  
**[0:04:40-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:40):**  kind of passed on into kicked on, if you like, into the next parliament's mandate. In the  meantime, COVID has happened. The Green Deal has been launched. I know we'll be coming  to that later. And so that has made made a complicated landscape even more difficult  
**[0:04:54-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:54):**  to navigate.  And you mentioned battles and I kind of get the impression that people were trying to  get the cap sorted before meddlesome things like Farm to Fork and the Green Deal came  
**[0:05:04-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:04):**  along so that that it was easier to kind of say, okay, well, we're doing what we're doing  with cap and we'll think about this, this green stuff to a greater extent a bit later.  Is that fair?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:14):**  I think that is fair. And there were some specific attempts in the parliament, certainly  coming from the green groups to try to start from scratch and to say, in the meantime,  a lot has changed. The original cap proposal is no longer valid, we need to start from  
**[0:05:27-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:27):**  scratch. And those those attempts were dashed, they were voted down. There were also attempts  to link the cap reforms more closely to what's going on within the Green Deal. And those  those attempts have been quashed as well.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:39):**  Well, it sounds like there's some good stories and possibly some good gossip in there. So  let's come back to the political machinations a little bit later. Thanks very much for setting  that out. That's really clear. Pierre-Marie, what were your own ambitions for cap reform  
**[0:05:53-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:53):**  when this all started?  Given the importance of the cap, I was hoping a much greener, much fairer and healthier  cap. That was what we were all expecting, even though we were not necessarily hoping  
**[0:06:05-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:05):**  it could happen, given the political struggles that we briefly mentioned. So why? Why did  we expect that? And why did we put all of our energy in trying to get that? We need  a greener cap, that's for sure. We all know how biodiversity has been affected, how our  
**[0:06:21-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:21):**  soils have been affected by the evolution of agricultural practices. And so we need  the cap to fix that, because the cap has contributed greatly to that to that situation. So what  the cap has done, it can resolve. So that was the first point. And when I say what I'm  
**[0:06:37-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:37):**  saying greener, I'm speaking of climate, of course. So how can agriculture be less carbon  emitting, but also biodiversity friendly? And I'm saying that because the when in 2017,  the Commission put on the table the proposal for the new cap, greener was all about climate.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:54):**  I mean, the question of biodiversity was just sort of ignored. So what was in the mindset  was like, we need a climate smart agriculture. What about biodiversity? So that's the first  point. And I mean, my expectations were sort of dashed very early in the process. And one  
**[0:07:09-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:09):**  of the things we did for that was to propose an agroecological scenario for the Ukrainian  government, where basically we show that biodiversity friendly agriculture could be a realistic  option for feeding Europeans and feeding the world.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:23):**  Do you think Pierre-Marie that there has been any progress on that at all?  I mean, at least in the debate, I wouldn't say that thanks to Idri, things have changed.  But at least we've contributed to a sort of global movement, whereby it's been realised  
**[0:07:38-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:38):**  that, well, it's possible to combine both. And the idea of an agroecological transition,  is gaining traction. So we're trying to put that on the table, trying to show that basically  there are rooms of manoeuvre to at the same time, reduce the action table of inputs, centrifuge  
**[0:07:54-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:54):**  inputs that are basically the key drivers of biodiversity loss and secreting carbon  and limiting carbon emission without diminishing food production. And that's the key tension  we are trying to sort of solve through an agroecological lens. But that's not an easy  
**[0:08:11-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:11):**  task given the sort of a stronger position and strong interest we have to face.  Fantastic. Nick Jacobs from IPES, what were your hopes?  The key thing we were looking for here was the end of this direct payment model, which  
**[0:08:26-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:26):**  we know does not deliver emissions cuts, it does not deliver benefits of biodiversity,  it does not give farmers sufficient incentives to really change their practices. We wanted  to see that fundamentally called into question. And instead, what we're seeing in the compromises  
**[0:08:42-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:42):**  coming out of parliament are really most of the money in the cap being reserved for that  direct payment model. What we wanted to see is payments for public goods. There are various  different ways of doing this. I think there needed to be now at this point in time, knowing  
**[0:08:55-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:55):**  what we know about environmental breakdown, the threats we're facing, there needed to  be a really clear signal that farmers will get all the support they need for shifting  towards sustainable modes of production, and particularly redesigning their farming systems,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:09):**  whether it's an agroecological set of principles or regenerative agriculture, organic, all  of these systems that really try to redesign, rethink the different aspects of the farm  to combine different species, combining crops and livestock, finding natural synergies,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:26):**  building agri diversity, building biodiversity, we need to be looking beyond a single outcome,  like climate mitigation. And we know that these diversified systems can drive multiple  benefits, including for productivity, because if you get the pollinators back, if you get  
**[0:09:41-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:41):**  the soil healthy, your production will increase and will be sustained over time, particularly  when we're facing droughts and other kind of external shocks. Well, one more thing we  were looking for was really this policy to go beyond agriculture. It sounds like a contradiction  
**[0:09:54-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:54):**  in terms and yet in the commission's own proposals, they have laid out objectives really covering  the whole food system, including societal health, and the bulk of cap money has traditionally  gone to farmers, it still will. We're looking for support towards resilient sustainable  
**[0:10:09-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:09):**  supply chains as well. We need to join up the production side with the consumer side,  or farmers won't have enough incentive to shift. And that's again, why we're pinning  more of our hopes on the farm to fork strategy, which starts off on a different basis.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:23):**  PM Marie, you wanted to come in.  I just wanted to flag that if you want to think about reforming the direct payment,  we also need to understand where they come from. And basically the region of the direct  
**[0:10:34-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:34):**  payment has to be found in the WTO negotiation and the irregularity round itself from 1989  to 1995, which eventually led to the formation of WTO. And why were direct payments made  mandatory? Because the European Union in that deal obtained in Marrakesh agreed on cutting  
**[0:10:55-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:55):**  price support to farmers. So the reason why we have those decoupled payments is because  we had agreed something with other countries at the world level within the WTO framework.  So if we want to undo that, we need to find a good justification. And the good justification  
**[0:11:11-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:11):**  that was found in 2004 was that, okay, we can still maintain a very high level of support  to farmers, but if we decouple it from the production and couple it to delivering of  some public goods, that was the world league of Pascal Lamy at the stage, then we can still  
**[0:11:28-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:28):**  be in the green box of WTO. I don't want to enter into those details, but still that's  very important. So if we want to get out from income support, then we have to think about  a justification for the World Trade Organization. And the second point is, can we think about  
**[0:11:44-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:44):**  if we don't want to get rid of that because it's too complex to renegotiate that Marrakesh  agreement on trade, can we think about a way to deliver direct payments, which will be  more outcome based as you mentioned? In theory, the answer is yes. I mean, this is the enhanced  
**[0:11:59-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:59):**  conditionality that we are trying to put in force since 2013. Early. I mean, in 2013,  we should remember that the public money for public good was already there in the debate.  And I mean, we had a very great coalition of different society organizations, etc, pushing  
**[0:12:14-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:14):**  the commission for that. And the first draft of the commission was not that bad. But it  was then worked down by MEPs and then member states, we could do that theoretically, but  in practice, it becomes something very complex. We've seen that it requires controls, it requires  
**[0:12:29-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:29):**  good metrics. And then there is very strong struggles about what are the good metrics,  etc, etc.  And a tendency to over bureaucratize and over administrate so that you end up with a big  
**[0:12:40-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:40):**  draft of metrics rather than a smaller set of metrics, which is really focused on outcomes  and delivers across the board. Nick,  I would like to add one point, the EU already has the example of what's being done in its  
**[0:12:54-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:54):**  rural development programs. So this is the second pillar of the cap, it gets less budget  than the first pillar for direct payments. And the beauty of having 27 different member  states with different plans, even at the sub regional level is that you have lots of examples  
**[0:13:08-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:08):**  of schemes that are designed in many cases to deliver public goods. Many of them are  agro environmental schemes. And we have some good examples that can be drawn on from some  of the regions that have gone a bit further in this regard. And so a different way to  
**[0:13:21-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:21):**  look at cap reform would be to say, well, let's start from what we're doing well in  this pillar to take the best examples, try to generalize them while bearing in mind that  you know, the different realities of different member states, because as you've both mentioned,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:35):**  it is complicated when your starting point is direct payments, it's difficult to turn  those into anything but a bureaucratic nightmare when you start adding condition on condition.  I'm going to move on if that's okay. And what I'd like to talk about is the way in which  
**[0:13:52-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:52):**  there has appeared to be a disconnection sometimes in EU policy for the way that food production  and supporting farmers ground level has been approached, and then how sustainability has  been delivered. And I think this is this is something that happens across the board in  
**[0:14:08-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:08):**  governments around the world. And obviously, the EU as a bureaucratic entity is no different.  One department does this, another department does that. And, you know, we started talking  about the way in which some of the inadequacies of the cap perhaps have been recognized. And  
**[0:14:25-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:25):**  then parallel strategies such as farm to fork and the Green Deal have then been developed  to try and counteract to an extent and to recognize some of those challenges. Could  you talk to us a little bit about those parallel strategies?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:39):**  There is an issue of divide and rule here. There's an ambitious farm to fork strategy  that's been put forward. And then you have the first opportunity to really make it a  reality to make the Green Deal a reality through these cap reforms, and it's not being taken.  
**[0:14:54-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:54):**  So there is I think, a suspicion that there's kind of politics at play here. And the farm  to fork strategy is being thrown towards civil society groups and research groups as a way  of saying, hey, we do care about these issues. And at the same time, the cap remains very  
**[0:15:07-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:07):**  much a policy for farmers for the farm lobbies. I can also say say something more generally  about the the farm to fork strategy and where it's come from. So the Green Deal is the starting  point. This is the flagship sustainability strategy of the new European Commission under  
**[0:15:22-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:22):**  Ursula von der Leyen. This has actions in various sectors to get us towards sustainability and  net zero in Europe. The agriculture and food sector is one of those that has been identified  through the farm to fork strategy. You also have measures on renewable energy, you have  
**[0:15:38-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:38):**  proposals for a carbon tax, like multiple sectors, the farm to fork strategy is one  piece in a bigger puzzle. What's interesting about this strategy is that it has the potential  to get us beyond the deadlock of cap reforms. The cap reforms for a long time have really  
**[0:15:53-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:53):**  been blocked by the power of agricultural lobbies to control these debates. As I mentioned,  it's a very esoteric kind of process. And there are points where the process becomes  very difficult to input into and decisions are made behind closed doors. And at those  
**[0:16:07-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:07):**  points, the agricultural lobbies are really able to control things. The farm to fork strategy  is different because this starting point was multiple European Commission departments working  together to deliver a strategy with cross cutting objectives for the whole food system.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:21):**  So we're looking at things like healthy diets, looking at environmental transitions, looking  at improving the conditions and livelihoods of farmers and food system workers. And and  what's interesting and very promising about the strategy is that because of that process  
**[0:16:36-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:36):**  being better, we've also got better proposals on the table. And we have proposals for big  reductions in pesticide use in fertilizer use in use of antimicrobials and proposals  for expanding the organic production area by 25%. By 2030, for example, coupled with  
**[0:16:55-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:55):**  proposals on how to increase consumption of organic and how to build healthier food environments.  That's a term being used really to describe all of the different policies you'd need to  look at to make the healthy sustainable choice the easiest choice for consumers. So it's  
**[0:17:09-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:09):**  a joined up strategy for the first time. It's better, it's more aligned with the needs of  citizens and and the views put forward by civil society, because it has been developed  in a more democratic way. But we're at a very early stage of the process. Even within the  
**[0:17:24-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:24):**  strategy, there's been intensive lobbying, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. We've  seen these very long standing narratives about food security come back and be reinvented.  There's really been a battle to own the narratives around COVID-19 and what it means for food  
**[0:17:40-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:40):**  systems, European and globally. And what we've heard, I think very, very vocally from agribusinesses,  from farm lobbies in the food industry, is that European food supply chains have proven  their resilience, it's proven the necessity of funding farmers, not imposing new demands  
**[0:17:56-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:56):**  on them, because they're already facing these strains and performing in such a resilient  way. So that is being used as a grounds to try to water down the farm to cook strategy.  So it seems that we have on one hand, the Common Agricultural Policy in its new form,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:10):**  which to an extent has been watered down to the point where it's relatively business as  usual to summarise it slightly projoratively. But then you've got this other strategy which  has come in with the von der Leyen presidency, where there is a much better understanding  
**[0:18:24-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:24):**  of the way that food production interrelates with other aspects of society and the food  system more broadly. And you know, we referred earlier on to the political struggle to try  and get CAP done and dusted before they had to sort of work out how to integrate this  
**[0:18:40-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:40):**  pesky farm to fork strategy. And I just wonder if you could you talk to us a little bit about  how that political struggle between the different interests is actually playing out and and  to what extent there is room to change the next few years of the CAP at this stage? Or  
**[0:18:57-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:57):**  do we just need to kind of wait for the next round of reform?  First and foremost, we have to remember that the Green Deal and the farm to fork are instruments  from the Commission that are not binding. So whatever is in there is just an orientation  
**[0:19:12-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:12):**  that the Commission proposes to member states to take. That's that's the first point. And  in that sense, I tend to agree with Nick that it might be something that was thrown to a  CSOs, to CSOs, to CSOs, to say, hey, guys, we are listening to you, here is something  
**[0:19:26-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:26):**  you can play with it. However, even though it's not something which might become legally  binding for anyone, as Nick mentioned, there were a lot of struggles around the definition  of what will be in there. The first one was within the Commission itself. I mean, as Nick  
**[0:19:42-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:42):**  said that the farm to fork has been designed jointly by the DigiAgri, Digisanko and Digi  Environments, at least other Digis also contributed. But at first stage, we should realize that  between the three Digis, there were not simple agreements, and they had to struggle pretty  
**[0:20:01-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:01):**  much and Digi Environments had to push very, very hard for this idea of reducing by 50%  the use and risk of pesticides, for example, or that they will set a target at 25% of organic  agriculture by 2030. So that was very, very hard.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:16):**  I'm just going to interrupt for a second, if I may, just to explain what Digi means.  So for listeners that aren't aware, so Digi is Directorate General, which effectively  is the Department of, so Digi Sante, as it is now, is responsible, I think, for the farm  
**[0:20:30-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:30):**  to fork strategy. And then Digi Agri is the Department responsible for delivering the  Common Agricultural Policy. Sorry to interrupt Pierre-Marie.  No worries, sorry for noting that. But then what is interesting is to see that behind  
**[0:20:42-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:42):**  the scene, if I may, there were a lot of stakeholders trying to influence the position of Digi Agri,  of Digi Sante, of Digi Environment. And you must remember that Digi Environment is 200  persons working, while Digi Agri is 1000 persons working full time. So you can see how it can  
**[0:20:59-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:59):**  be difficult for Digi Environments to get something out of there. But then we had that  first round of negotiation, and many stakeholders trying to get their voice heard by the different  Digis. And we know that at the end of the day, some very tough arbitrations were made  
**[0:21:15-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:15):**  at the presidency level of the Commission. But then the key question now, and I will  stop here, is that now that we have the farm to fork, it is what it is, and it's not bad  at all. I mean, there are many, many interesting points on which we can come at it. The question  
**[0:21:28-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:28):**  is, what member states will do with that? And what they have said, basically, is they  don't want to commit to anything in relationship to the farm to fork, because it's not legally  binding.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:38):**  That's one of the common criticisms, I think, isn't it, that sort of come up around the  farm to fork strategy, the fact that it isn't binding. And one of the others is that they're  still seems to be a debate about exactly how to define what food sustainability is. But  
**[0:21:53-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:53):**  at the same time, the farm to fork strategy is quite detailed. But as you say, if it's  non binding, and there aren't the legal actions to underpin those policy objectives, then  there is a degree to which it may simply end up being another opportunity to talk about  
**[0:22:09-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:09):**  this stuff, rather than actually get this stuff done. Nick,  that's right, there are some big risks here. I think the major battleground is going to  be the cap strategic plans that each member state now has to put in place in the next  
**[0:22:22-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:22):**  few years. Let's not forget, one of the most important elements of this cap reform is effectively  the renationalization of big chunks of the cap. A lot of decision making will now be  taken in Paris, in Berlin, in Rome on how to distribute cap money. That's a conscious  
**[0:22:37-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:37):**  decision from the European Commission to give those powers back and perhaps wash their hands  of some of the public discontent that comes from this policy. As member states put those  plans in place, they can decide to take into account to a greater or lesser extent what  
**[0:22:53-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:53):**  is in the farm to fork strategy. They can decide to get their farming sectors ready  for those transitions to less pesticides, less synthetic fertilizer or not. A lot of  that will depend on the strength of civil society within those countries pushing their  
**[0:23:07-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:07):**  governments to do that. The European Commission has said they will ultimately be responsible  for approving these cap implementation plans that come forward from the different member  states. In doing that, they'll be taking into account what they've put forward in the farm  
**[0:23:20-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:20):**  to fork strategy. The devil is always in the details. They can do that in an authoritative  way or they can do that in a very lenient way, depending on how much political pressure  they feel. Let's be clear, if the cap does nothing to prepare these transitions to get  
**[0:23:37-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:37):**  farmers ready and moving towards reductions in use of synthetic inputs, then the goals  in the farm to fork strategy simply won't be reached.  It's interesting to hear you talking about the way in which the Commission, through its  
**[0:23:49-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:49):**  cap reform, is devolving delivery back to individual member states and that that's become  something that's important within the European Union. And I guess part of it is going to  be looking at how individual member states, individual member state governments, look  
**[0:24:04-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:04):**  at agriculture and look at the way that they want to manage their economic futures. And  so there'd be competition between the need for or desire for short term profit to continue  keeping food prices low, addressing that food security question versus the long term cost  
**[0:24:23-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:23):**  of these external impacts associated with agriculture and how forward thinking individual  governments are. And I wonder if either of you have any thoughts about where that leadership  is likely to come at a member state level.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:35):**  I think it's a very good question, but a tough one. And one thing we must say before that  we should not forget that all member states are on a common market for agricultural goods,  which means that basically when a member state takes one decision in one direction, for example,  
**[0:24:54-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:54):**  being not being ambitious and, you know, providing a lot of support without any conditionalities,  it gives in a way a sort of comparative advantage to its farmers. And in turn, because all those  farmers are competing on the very same market and all those farmers are producing more and  
**[0:25:10-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:10):**  more and more and more because we are intensifying production, they need export outlets. So whatever  a country does, it does in effect affect what another can do. And I will take a very concrete  example, not because I'm French, but because it's the French reality. Back in 2018, the  
**[0:25:27-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:27):**  French government decided to ban neo-nico-teno-id before all the rest of member states. So it  was mandatory, but France did that a bit earlier than others, which eventually resulted in  some French farmers becoming less competitive than others, and their production costs had  
**[0:25:45-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:45):**  to rise a little bit. And I mean, for French farmers, it's like, well, fair enough, I'm  happy to contribute to environmental advancements. But if it's at the cost of my viability from  a economic point of view, I'm not playing that game. So just to say that the risk we  
**[0:25:58-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:58):**  are running, and it's a real risk, and I mean, we already experienced that in 2013, is a  race to the bottom. That's what we are facing now. And so thinking about who's going to  lead in terms of, you know, being like more ambitious than others is fine. But we should  
**[0:26:13-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:13):**  probably raise the question the other way around, who's going to lead in being very,  very little ambitious, and then bringing all of those member states down to something very  little with very little ambition.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:24):**  So within that, that sounds like it's an argument for a sort of continuation of that EU-wide  approach that we've been used to, and that you're concerned that the risk perhaps of  delegating this to member state level is too great.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:39):**  That's exactly what I say. And when you raise that point with DiGiegli, what they say is  basically no worries, we're going to make sure that the strategic national plans for  the current implementation of the national level will fit with overall EU objectives.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:54):**  But I mean, we've no idea how they are going to do that on the one hand. On the other hand,  we have a clear idea about the fact that the political legitimacy of the European Commission  is declining. So the extent to which the European Commission will be able to oppose national  
**[0:27:08-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:08):**  strategic plan, which is not ambitious enough, for me is really loud.  So I would say we probably need to keep sort of overarching ambition at the EU level, and  make sure that member states individually do not have too much capacity to reallocate  
**[0:27:23-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:23):**  firms without strong, you know, premise.  Nick, I'm going to come to you. Do you think there is that need for a much stronger framework  at commission level? Or do you think that it's possible that that kind of member state  
**[0:27:34-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:34):**  led approach could work?  I'm sceptical about the member state approach. And I think Pierre Marie hit the nail on the  head when he said race to the bottom. Again, we have an example already in rural development  
**[0:27:45-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:45):**  schemes where member states have been able to really do what they want and allocate the  money in different ways. Before I mentioned this, this has yielded some very positive  experimentation with agri-environment schemes. On the other hand, it has also shown that  
**[0:27:57-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:57):**  most member states when given this flexibility, pour that money into increasing their competitiveness,  very business as usual kind of investments in farm productivity and infrastructure. So  I don't have very high hopes that it's also hard to see where the leadership will come  
**[0:28:13-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:13):**  from. To make this work, you'd really need the biggest producing nations like France,  Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, really to all take this seriously and to be competing  to be the most sustainable. It's very hard to see that happen. It's a very uneven state  
**[0:28:28-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:28):**  of affairs. If you're looking at agri-environment schemes, France has maybe done more than other  countries there. If you're looking at phasing out antimicrobials in livestock, the Dutch  have done that fairly successfully and kind of got consumers on board. If you're looking  
**[0:28:43-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:43):**  at getting organic food into schools and public canteens, the Copenhagen region in Denmark  has done a fantastic job. It's bitty. It's very hard to really find an example of a country  or even a major region that has done all of these things well and has really pinned its  
**[0:28:59-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:59):**  flag to the mast in terms of a transition to sustainable food systems.  I wonder if we can sort of look ahead five years. We've got the cap that was essentially  reformed and developed under the old commission. You've got the Green Deal and Farm to Fork  
**[0:29:12-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:12):**  coming in with the new commission. In five years' time, will anything have changed, do  you think, at field level?  Well, my sense is that we are likely to continue the two processes that have led to the situation  
**[0:29:24-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:24):**  in which we are, which is on the one hand, intensification of the most productive areas  and on the other hand, a gradual abandonment of the disproductive areas with all which  comes with, which is like disappearance of extensive plant grasslands that are host of  
**[0:29:39-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:39):**  high biodiversity species. So that's my expectations. We don't have any great, I would say, aspects  of the cap that could prevent the European land use to move in different directions than  what it has been moving on for the last decade.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:55):**  So that sounds like a continuing intensification of the majority of agricultural land with  a bit of set aside for nature, a bit of abandonment perhaps leading to rewilding by default, but  a continuation effectively of what's been a sparing approach, which to me seems really  
**[0:30:14-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:14):**  inefficient when actually the majority of land could be delivering the multiple outcomes  we were talking about before. Nick, where do you think we're going to be in five years?  I agree with Pierre-Marie. I think we're going to be continuing the same direction of travel,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:27):**  which is not a good one. It's not seeing the type of change or the pace of change that  we need. I think the cap reforms as they look right now will mean that some medium-sized  bigger farms will be able to stay in business, but really just delaying the inevitable and  
**[0:30:43-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:43):**  not transitioning in their practices, staying in business largely as a result of these subsidies.  And that's really something no farmer wants to do. And delaying that transition that would  need to happen for them to increase productivity by improving the soil health and improving  
**[0:30:59-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:59):**  the situation with regards to biodiversity. And also delaying what is inevitable in terms  of how markets are evolving, because markets I think will increasingly reward different  niches of production, particularly those who are producing more sustainably. And we would  
**[0:31:15-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:15):**  need policies to be getting farmers ready to connect to those opportunities. And we're  not seeing that. So I think very much business as usual, and unfortunately business as usual,  means the continued disappearance of a lot of smaller and less competitive farms.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:29):**  I'd like to come back to the UK, move back across the English Channel. I wonder, looking  from the outside, whether the EU are aware of what's happening in the UK around land  use and agricultural policy.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:42):**  Well, as a matter of fact, we've been working with different organisations in the UK to  develop an agricultural scenario for the UK, which will be published hopefully by early  January at the Oxford Real Farm Conference. So we do have a look at it. One of the key  
**[0:31:59-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:59):**  points besides the fact that what we've demonstrated and what will be published is that an agricultural  UK is possible from a food, biodiversity and a carbon perspective. That's the key result.  Beyond that, I think one of the key questions that the UK people will have to address in  
**[0:32:16-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:16):**  the coming probably weeks and months is how do they want to relate to the rest of the  world from a trade perspective? Because the choice or the choices that could be made on  that respect will have a definitive impact on what farmers can do and what could be the  
**[0:32:31-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:31):**  role of the public money for public goods you are mentioning for farmers to really deliver  on different objectives.  If there are things that the UK gets right, is there an incentive at EU level, at a Commission  
**[0:32:43-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:43):**  level to be able to cherry pick some of those things and learn from them and embed them  in the future and at the same time see the things that we don't get quite right and learn  from that as well?  
**[0:32:54-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:54):**  Yeah, I think there is a potential there, particularly in terms of the timing, because  the UK is going to be phasing out basic payments, direct payments to farmers over the next kind  of seven year period. And this corresponds more or less to the timing of the next cap  
**[0:33:10-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:10):**  reform. So by the time of the next cap reform, we might have an example just across the channel  of how to do public payments for public goods in a way that works, but we might not. And  I think a lot of people in Brussels are looking with a good degree of scepticism and that  
**[0:33:27-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:27):**  includes myself, scepticism around whether this will actually happen or not. And if you  look at the plans in terms of what the government would like to do in the agricultural sector  and the realities of the post Brexit landscape, and you know, we're seeing reports talking  
**[0:33:42-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:42):**  about higher food prices, potentially lower availability of fruit and vegetables, fresh  foods, potential reductions of standards, if the UK is going to be doing trade deals  with the US and other countries that do have lower food safety standards than the EU, then  
**[0:33:58-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:58):**  it is really hard to square that with an agricultural policy that is positioning the UK as a pioneer,  encouraging farmers to produce in a sustainable way to treat farm workers well, to take on  costs that would need to be rewarded in terms of the prices they'll receive. So it's just  
**[0:34:16-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:16):**  very hard to square those things. And I think there is a good degree of scepticism around  whether this will actually work and whether the UK will be able to chart this different  course between the European model with its high standards and high regulations and a  
**[0:34:30-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:30):**  very deregulated model. And I think that there's a quite well founded fear that this public  goods approach will be kind of slowly jettisoned or watered down as the pressures to produce  competitively in a post Brexit marketplace are brought to bear. I would like to draw  
**[0:34:45-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:45):**  a sort of parallelism with what's going on in the EU, because in the EU, you have the  cap reforms, and then you have this more cross sectoral farm to fork strategy taking shape.  In the UK, you have the debate around the agriculture bill, but you also have a UK food  
**[0:34:59-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:59):**  strategy that's been put forward in part this year, and I think we'll be seeing more of  it early next year. And when we look at questions like trade, they take on a very different  complexion when we're looking at them in the context of a broader strategy for the future  
**[0:35:12-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:12):**  of food systems in the EU or the UK. And so if the UK food strategy is really taken seriously  by the government, we'll know, you know, what are the priorities? Is the priority a war  on obesity? Are we going to be really trying to connect farmers to local markets to use  
**[0:35:27-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:27):**  public procurement to really spark a transition to sustainability? Are we going to be raising  standards that way and raising environmental performance? And if we are, then it doesn't  make sense to sacrifice all that for the sake of trade agreements. But if we're just looking  
**[0:35:42-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:42):**  from a purely agricultural point of view, and then it just becomes one sector among  many in a trade negotiation, then those trade offs do get made and they will continue to  get made to the detriment of farmers trying to produce in a sustainable way.

### Farm Gate  (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 09:50:54)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Costayne. In this programme, I'm crossing  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:10):**  the English Channel, which seems to have become emotionally much wider since the UK left the  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:15):**  European Union. What's been happening on the continent, as we Brits used to call mainland  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:20):**  Europe? The Common Agricultural Policy has been going through its latest round of reforms,  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:25):**  while parallel processes have been instigated to deliver sustainable food from farm to fork.  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:31):**  Nick Jacobs is the director of IPES Food, and Pierre-Marie Aubert is the coordinator  
**[0:00:36-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:36):**  of the European Agriculture Initiative for IDDRI. And they're my guests today. Hello  
**[0:00:42-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:42):**  both. Hello all. Hello Finnlow, thanks for inviting  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:45):**  me. Yeah, so I'm Pierre-Marie Aubert working at IDRI. IDRI stands for the Institute for  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:50):**  Sustainable Development and International Relations. We are a small think tank based  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:00:55):**  in Paris working on sustainable development policies. And as you said, I'm coordinating  
**[0:01:00-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:00):**  the initiative on European agriculture. Basically, we work on scenario towards an agro-ecological  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:07):**  transition trying to combine biophysical dimension, which is biodiversity, climate, socio economic  
**[0:01:13-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:13):**  dimensions and the political economy of the transition.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:16):**  Thank you Nick. So I work for IPES Food that stands for the  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:20):**  International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems. This is a panel that was set  
**[0:01:25-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:25):**  up in 2015. And it brings together about 25 experts from a range of different disciplines.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:31):**  So you have agronomists, sociologists, political scientists working together with leading  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:37):**  practitioners from civil society and social movements to come forward with recommendations  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:42):**  on how to reform food systems globally. We've also looked in detail at European policies.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:47):**  And that's really been a focus through my career. And I started out in Brussels as a  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:51):**  journalist working on the Common Agricultural Policy, which unfortunately doesn't look very  
**[0:01:55-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:55):**  different today to what it did then about 10 years ago.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:01:58):**  Thanks for that. I think that's that's almost the end of the programme. It doesn't look  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:01):**  any different, everybody. Thanks very much for those those introductions. Nick, let's  
**[0:02:06-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:06):**  let's just start, if I may, with some nuts and bolts. You know, some of the listeners,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:10):**  I guess, you know, won't be entirely familiar with the Common Agricultural Policy and what  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:14):**  it is. So what is the Common Agricultural Policy? How does the cap reform process work?  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:20):**  You know, briefly, and at this point, do we know when the new cap is likely to take effect?  
**[0:02:26-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:26):**  I think it's been delayed by COVID. What's going on?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:29):**  The Common Agricultural Policy is one of the EU's oldest policies, one of its foundational  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:33):**  policies. And when it came into force in the 1950s and 60s, the original goal was to deliver  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:40):**  food security in the post-war context. And those goals and objectives have evolved since  
**[0:02:46-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:46):**  then. It's now a policy that primarily provides financial support to farmers. I think it's  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:51):**  seen by most people now as an income support policy. It also regulates how farmers can  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:02:56):**  produce food and it regulates agricultural markets.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:00):**  And the budget, I mean, at one point, it was nearly half of the EU's budget, and it's now  
**[0:03:03-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:03):**  down to about a third.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:05):**  It was. It's now closer to 30%. And that's really reflecting the different priorities  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:10):**  that have come onto the table recently, notably immigration and higher research budgets. So  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:15):**  the cap process then is long and complex. And there are lots of inter-institutional  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:21):**  battles between the different institutions based in Brussels. It starts with the European  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:25):**  Commission that makes proposals. Then you have the European Parliament committees that  
**[0:03:29-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:29):**  make amendments to those proposals. You have the groups in the parliament trying to form  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:33):**  agreement. And then at the same time, you have the governments and the agricultural  
**[0:03:37-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:37):**  ministers from the 27 EU member states trying to reach an agreement in the council. The  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:42):**  European Parliament then votes on amendments in its plenary sessions. But in reality, what  
**[0:03:48-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:48):**  we've seen this time is actually the three big political groups in the parliament, the  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:51):**  socialist group, the EPP conservative group and the liberal group Renew, have been able  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:03:57):**  to kind of reach a consensus on their own, something some people are calling a stitcher.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:01):**  So you really you have that agreement in the parliament, then the council will agree on  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:05):**  its own approach. And then eventually you have something called trial logs, which we're  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:08):**  going to be entering shortly, where the three institutions get together behind closed doors  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:12):**  and try to hammer out some final compromises. And just to clarify, the cap was already meant  
**[0:04:17-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:17):**  to be in place. At this point, we're in an extension period. So it's still the old cap,  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:21):**  the pre 2020 cap that's in place now and is running under an extension.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:25):**  And why is that?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:27):**  It's primarily because the institutions didn't manage to reach an agreement before the last  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:32):**  commission and the last parliament came to the end of their mandates in 2019. So the  
**[0:04:36-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:36):**  dossier is it's always complicated. It was even more complicated this time. And it was  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:40):**  kind of passed on into kicked on, if you like, into the next parliament's mandate. In the  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:44):**  meantime, COVID has happened. The Green Deal has been launched. I know we'll be coming  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:49):**  to that later. And so that has made made a complicated landscape even more difficult  
**[0:04:54-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:54):**  to navigate.  
**[0:04:55-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:55):**  And you mentioned battles and I kind of get the impression that people were trying to  
**[0:04:59-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:04:59):**  get the cap sorted before meddlesome things like Farm to Fork and the Green Deal came  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:04):**  along so that that it was easier to kind of say, okay, well, we're doing what we're doing  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:08):**  with cap and we'll think about this, this green stuff to a greater extent a bit later.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:13):**  Is that fair?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:14):**  I think that is fair. And there were some specific attempts in the parliament, certainly  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:19):**  coming from the green groups to try to start from scratch and to say, in the meantime,  
**[0:05:24-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:24):**  a lot has changed. The original cap proposal is no longer valid, we need to start from  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:27):**  scratch. And those those attempts were dashed, they were voted down. There were also attempts  
**[0:05:32-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:32):**  to link the cap reforms more closely to what's going on within the Green Deal. And those  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:37):**  those attempts have been quashed as well.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:39):**  Well, it sounds like there's some good stories and possibly some good gossip in there. So  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:43):**  let's come back to the political machinations a little bit later. Thanks very much for setting  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:47):**  that out. That's really clear. Pierre-Marie, what were your own ambitions for cap reform  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:53):**  when this all started?  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:54):**  Given the importance of the cap, I was hoping a much greener, much fairer and healthier  
**[0:05:59-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:05:59):**  cap. That was what we were all expecting, even though we were not necessarily hoping  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:05):**  it could happen, given the political struggles that we briefly mentioned. So why? Why did  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:10):**  we expect that? And why did we put all of our energy in trying to get that? We need  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:16):**  a greener cap, that's for sure. We all know how biodiversity has been affected, how our  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:21):**  soils have been affected by the evolution of agricultural practices. And so we need  
**[0:06:26-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:26):**  the cap to fix that, because the cap has contributed greatly to that to that situation. So what  
**[0:06:32-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:32):**  the cap has done, it can resolve. So that was the first point. And when I say what I'm  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:37):**  saying greener, I'm speaking of climate, of course. So how can agriculture be less carbon  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:43):**  emitting, but also biodiversity friendly? And I'm saying that because the when in 2017,  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:49):**  the Commission put on the table the proposal for the new cap, greener was all about climate.  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:06:54):**  I mean, the question of biodiversity was just sort of ignored. So what was in the mindset  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:00):**  was like, we need a climate smart agriculture. What about biodiversity? So that's the first  
**[0:07:05-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:05):**  point. And I mean, my expectations were sort of dashed very early in the process. And one  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:09):**  of the things we did for that was to propose an agroecological scenario for the Ukrainian  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:15):**  government, where basically we show that biodiversity friendly agriculture could be a realistic  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:21):**  option for feeding Europeans and feeding the world.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:23):**  Do you think Pierre-Marie that there has been any progress on that at all?  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:28):**  I mean, at least in the debate, I wouldn't say that thanks to Idri, things have changed.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:33):**  But at least we've contributed to a sort of global movement, whereby it's been realised  
**[0:07:38-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:38):**  that, well, it's possible to combine both. And the idea of an agroecological transition,  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:44):**  is gaining traction. So we're trying to put that on the table, trying to show that basically  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:49):**  there are rooms of manoeuvre to at the same time, reduce the action table of inputs, centrifuge  
**[0:07:54-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:54):**  inputs that are basically the key drivers of biodiversity loss and secreting carbon  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:07:59):**  and limiting carbon emission without diminishing food production. And that's the key tension  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:06):**  we are trying to sort of solve through an agroecological lens. But that's not an easy  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:11):**  task given the sort of a stronger position and strong interest we have to face.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:16):**  Fantastic. Nick Jacobs from IPES, what were your hopes?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:20):**  The key thing we were looking for here was the end of this direct payment model, which  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:26):**  we know does not deliver emissions cuts, it does not deliver benefits of biodiversity,  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:33):**  it does not give farmers sufficient incentives to really change their practices. We wanted  
**[0:08:37-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:37):**  to see that fundamentally called into question. And instead, what we're seeing in the compromises  
**[0:08:42-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:42):**  coming out of parliament are really most of the money in the cap being reserved for that  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:46):**  direct payment model. What we wanted to see is payments for public goods. There are various  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:51):**  different ways of doing this. I think there needed to be now at this point in time, knowing  
**[0:08:55-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:55):**  what we know about environmental breakdown, the threats we're facing, there needed to  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:08:59):**  be a really clear signal that farmers will get all the support they need for shifting  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:03):**  towards sustainable modes of production, and particularly redesigning their farming systems,  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:09):**  whether it's an agroecological set of principles or regenerative agriculture, organic, all  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:14):**  of these systems that really try to redesign, rethink the different aspects of the farm  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:19):**  to combine different species, combining crops and livestock, finding natural synergies,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:26):**  building agri diversity, building biodiversity, we need to be looking beyond a single outcome,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:31):**  like climate mitigation. And we know that these diversified systems can drive multiple  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:36):**  benefits, including for productivity, because if you get the pollinators back, if you get  
**[0:09:41-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:41):**  the soil healthy, your production will increase and will be sustained over time, particularly  
**[0:09:45-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:45):**  when we're facing droughts and other kind of external shocks. Well, one more thing we  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:49):**  were looking for was really this policy to go beyond agriculture. It sounds like a contradiction  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:54):**  in terms and yet in the commission's own proposals, they have laid out objectives really covering  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:09:59):**  the whole food system, including societal health, and the bulk of cap money has traditionally  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:04):**  gone to farmers, it still will. We're looking for support towards resilient sustainable  
**[0:10:09-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:09):**  supply chains as well. We need to join up the production side with the consumer side,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:15):**  or farmers won't have enough incentive to shift. And that's again, why we're pinning  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:19):**  more of our hopes on the farm to fork strategy, which starts off on a different basis.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:23):**  PM Marie, you wanted to come in.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:25):**  I just wanted to flag that if you want to think about reforming the direct payment,  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:29):**  we also need to understand where they come from. And basically the region of the direct  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:34):**  payment has to be found in the WTO negotiation and the irregularity round itself from 1989  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:41):**  to 1995, which eventually led to the formation of WTO. And why were direct payments made  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:49):**  mandatory? Because the European Union in that deal obtained in Marrakesh agreed on cutting  
**[0:10:55-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:10:55):**  price support to farmers. So the reason why we have those decoupled payments is because  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:02):**  we had agreed something with other countries at the world level within the WTO framework.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:07):**  So if we want to undo that, we need to find a good justification. And the good justification  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:11):**  that was found in 2004 was that, okay, we can still maintain a very high level of support  
**[0:11:17-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:17):**  to farmers, but if we decouple it from the production and couple it to delivering of  
**[0:11:23-0:11:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:23):**  some public goods, that was the world league of Pascal Lamy at the stage, then we can still  
**[0:11:28-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:28):**  be in the green box of WTO. I don't want to enter into those details, but still that's  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:32):**  very important. So if we want to get out from income support, then we have to think about  
**[0:11:38-0:11:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:38):**  a justification for the World Trade Organization. And the second point is, can we think about  
**[0:11:44-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:44):**  if we don't want to get rid of that because it's too complex to renegotiate that Marrakesh  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:49):**  agreement on trade, can we think about a way to deliver direct payments, which will be  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:54):**  more outcome based as you mentioned? In theory, the answer is yes. I mean, this is the enhanced  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:11:59):**  conditionality that we are trying to put in force since 2013. Early. I mean, in 2013,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:05):**  we should remember that the public money for public good was already there in the debate.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:09):**  And I mean, we had a very great coalition of different society organizations, etc, pushing  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:14):**  the commission for that. And the first draft of the commission was not that bad. But it  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:18):**  was then worked down by MEPs and then member states, we could do that theoretically, but  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:23):**  in practice, it becomes something very complex. We've seen that it requires controls, it requires  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:29):**  good metrics. And then there is very strong struggles about what are the good metrics,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:33):**  etc, etc.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:34):**  And a tendency to over bureaucratize and over administrate so that you end up with a big  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:40):**  draft of metrics rather than a smaller set of metrics, which is really focused on outcomes  
**[0:12:45-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:45):**  and delivers across the board. Nick,  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:48):**  I would like to add one point, the EU already has the example of what's being done in its  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:54):**  rural development programs. So this is the second pillar of the cap, it gets less budget  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:12:58):**  than the first pillar for direct payments. And the beauty of having 27 different member  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:03):**  states with different plans, even at the sub regional level is that you have lots of examples  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:08):**  of schemes that are designed in many cases to deliver public goods. Many of them are  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:12):**  agro environmental schemes. And we have some good examples that can be drawn on from some  
**[0:13:17-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:17):**  of the regions that have gone a bit further in this regard. And so a different way to  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:21):**  look at cap reform would be to say, well, let's start from what we're doing well in  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:25):**  this pillar to take the best examples, try to generalize them while bearing in mind that  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:30):**  you know, the different realities of different member states, because as you've both mentioned,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:35):**  it is complicated when your starting point is direct payments, it's difficult to turn  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:40):**  those into anything but a bureaucratic nightmare when you start adding condition on condition.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:45):**  I'm going to move on if that's okay. And what I'd like to talk about is the way in which  
**[0:13:52-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:52):**  there has appeared to be a disconnection sometimes in EU policy for the way that food production  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:13:59):**  and supporting farmers ground level has been approached, and then how sustainability has  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:04):**  been delivered. And I think this is this is something that happens across the board in  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:08):**  governments around the world. And obviously, the EU as a bureaucratic entity is no different.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:13):**  One department does this, another department does that. And, you know, we started talking  
**[0:14:18-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:18):**  about the way in which some of the inadequacies of the cap perhaps have been recognized. And  
**[0:14:25-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:25):**  then parallel strategies such as farm to fork and the Green Deal have then been developed  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:30):**  to try and counteract to an extent and to recognize some of those challenges. Could  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:35):**  you talk to us a little bit about those parallel strategies?  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:39):**  There is an issue of divide and rule here. There's an ambitious farm to fork strategy  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:44):**  that's been put forward. And then you have the first opportunity to really make it a  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:49):**  reality to make the Green Deal a reality through these cap reforms, and it's not being taken.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:54):**  So there is I think, a suspicion that there's kind of politics at play here. And the farm  
**[0:14:58-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:14:58):**  to fork strategy is being thrown towards civil society groups and research groups as a way  
**[0:15:04-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:04):**  of saying, hey, we do care about these issues. And at the same time, the cap remains very  
**[0:15:07-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:07):**  much a policy for farmers for the farm lobbies. I can also say say something more generally  
**[0:15:13-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:13):**  about the the farm to fork strategy and where it's come from. So the Green Deal is the starting  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:17):**  point. This is the flagship sustainability strategy of the new European Commission under  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:22):**  Ursula von der Leyen. This has actions in various sectors to get us towards sustainability and  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:28):**  net zero in Europe. The agriculture and food sector is one of those that has been identified  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:33):**  through the farm to fork strategy. You also have measures on renewable energy, you have  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:38):**  proposals for a carbon tax, like multiple sectors, the farm to fork strategy is one  
**[0:15:42-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:42):**  piece in a bigger puzzle. What's interesting about this strategy is that it has the potential  
**[0:15:48-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:48):**  to get us beyond the deadlock of cap reforms. The cap reforms for a long time have really  
**[0:15:53-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:53):**  been blocked by the power of agricultural lobbies to control these debates. As I mentioned,  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:15:59):**  it's a very esoteric kind of process. And there are points where the process becomes  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:03):**  very difficult to input into and decisions are made behind closed doors. And at those  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:07):**  points, the agricultural lobbies are really able to control things. The farm to fork strategy  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:11):**  is different because this starting point was multiple European Commission departments working  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:17):**  together to deliver a strategy with cross cutting objectives for the whole food system.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:21):**  So we're looking at things like healthy diets, looking at environmental transitions, looking  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:26):**  at improving the conditions and livelihoods of farmers and food system workers. And and  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:31):**  what's interesting and very promising about the strategy is that because of that process  
**[0:16:36-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:36):**  being better, we've also got better proposals on the table. And we have proposals for big  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:41):**  reductions in pesticide use in fertilizer use in use of antimicrobials and proposals  
**[0:16:48-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:48):**  for expanding the organic production area by 25%. By 2030, for example, coupled with  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:16:55):**  proposals on how to increase consumption of organic and how to build healthier food environments.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:00):**  That's a term being used really to describe all of the different policies you'd need to  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:04):**  look at to make the healthy sustainable choice the easiest choice for consumers. So it's  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:09):**  a joined up strategy for the first time. It's better, it's more aligned with the needs of  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:14):**  citizens and and the views put forward by civil society, because it has been developed  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:19):**  in a more democratic way. But we're at a very early stage of the process. Even within the  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:24):**  strategy, there's been intensive lobbying, particularly in the wake of COVID-19. We've  
**[0:17:29-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:29):**  seen these very long standing narratives about food security come back and be reinvented.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:35):**  There's really been a battle to own the narratives around COVID-19 and what it means for food  
**[0:17:40-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:40):**  systems, European and globally. And what we've heard, I think very, very vocally from agribusinesses,  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:45):**  from farm lobbies in the food industry, is that European food supply chains have proven  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:50):**  their resilience, it's proven the necessity of funding farmers, not imposing new demands  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:17:56):**  on them, because they're already facing these strains and performing in such a resilient  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:00):**  way. So that is being used as a grounds to try to water down the farm to cook strategy.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:05):**  So it seems that we have on one hand, the Common Agricultural Policy in its new form,  
**[0:18:10-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:10):**  which to an extent has been watered down to the point where it's relatively business as  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:14):**  usual to summarise it slightly projoratively. But then you've got this other strategy which  
**[0:18:19-0:18:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:19):**  has come in with the von der Leyen presidency, where there is a much better understanding  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:24):**  of the way that food production interrelates with other aspects of society and the food  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:29):**  system more broadly. And you know, we referred earlier on to the political struggle to try  
**[0:18:34-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:34):**  and get CAP done and dusted before they had to sort of work out how to integrate this  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:40):**  pesky farm to fork strategy. And I just wonder if you could you talk to us a little bit about  
**[0:18:44-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:44):**  how that political struggle between the different interests is actually playing out and and  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:51):**  to what extent there is room to change the next few years of the CAP at this stage? Or  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:18:57):**  do we just need to kind of wait for the next round of reform?  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:01):**  First and foremost, we have to remember that the Green Deal and the farm to fork are instruments  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:06):**  from the Commission that are not binding. So whatever is in there is just an orientation  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:12):**  that the Commission proposes to member states to take. That's that's the first point. And  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:17):**  in that sense, I tend to agree with Nick that it might be something that was thrown to a  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:21):**  CSOs, to CSOs, to CSOs, to say, hey, guys, we are listening to you, here is something  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:26):**  you can play with it. However, even though it's not something which might become legally  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:31):**  binding for anyone, as Nick mentioned, there were a lot of struggles around the definition  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:37):**  of what will be in there. The first one was within the Commission itself. I mean, as Nick  
**[0:19:42-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:42):**  said that the farm to fork has been designed jointly by the DigiAgri, Digisanko and Digi  
**[0:19:49-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:49):**  Environments, at least other Digis also contributed. But at first stage, we should realize that  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:19:55):**  between the three Digis, there were not simple agreements, and they had to struggle pretty  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:01):**  much and Digi Environments had to push very, very hard for this idea of reducing by 50%  
**[0:20:06-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:06):**  the use and risk of pesticides, for example, or that they will set a target at 25% of organic  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:13):**  agriculture by 2030. So that was very, very hard.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:16):**  I'm just going to interrupt for a second, if I may, just to explain what Digi means.  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:20):**  So for listeners that aren't aware, so Digi is Directorate General, which effectively  
**[0:20:25-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:25):**  is the Department of, so Digi Sante, as it is now, is responsible, I think, for the farm  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:30):**  to fork strategy. And then Digi Agri is the Department responsible for delivering the  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:34):**  Common Agricultural Policy. Sorry to interrupt Pierre-Marie.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:37):**  No worries, sorry for noting that. But then what is interesting is to see that behind  
**[0:20:42-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:42):**  the scene, if I may, there were a lot of stakeholders trying to influence the position of Digi Agri,  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:49):**  of Digi Sante, of Digi Environment. And you must remember that Digi Environment is 200  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:54):**  persons working, while Digi Agri is 1000 persons working full time. So you can see how it can  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:20:59):**  be difficult for Digi Environments to get something out of there. But then we had that  
**[0:21:04-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:04):**  first round of negotiation, and many stakeholders trying to get their voice heard by the different  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:10):**  Digis. And we know that at the end of the day, some very tough arbitrations were made  
**[0:21:15-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:15):**  at the presidency level of the Commission. But then the key question now, and I will  
**[0:21:19-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:19):**  stop here, is that now that we have the farm to fork, it is what it is, and it's not bad  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:24):**  at all. I mean, there are many, many interesting points on which we can come at it. The question  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:28):**  is, what member states will do with that? And what they have said, basically, is they  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:33):**  don't want to commit to anything in relationship to the farm to fork, because it's not legally  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:37):**  binding.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:38):**  That's one of the common criticisms, I think, isn't it, that sort of come up around the  
**[0:21:42-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:42):**  farm to fork strategy, the fact that it isn't binding. And one of the others is that they're  
**[0:21:45-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:45):**  still seems to be a debate about exactly how to define what food sustainability is. But  
**[0:21:53-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:53):**  at the same time, the farm to fork strategy is quite detailed. But as you say, if it's  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:21:57):**  non binding, and there aren't the legal actions to underpin those policy objectives, then  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:04):**  there is a degree to which it may simply end up being another opportunity to talk about  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:09):**  this stuff, rather than actually get this stuff done. Nick,  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:13):**  that's right, there are some big risks here. I think the major battleground is going to  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:18):**  be the cap strategic plans that each member state now has to put in place in the next  
**[0:22:22-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:22):**  few years. Let's not forget, one of the most important elements of this cap reform is effectively  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:27):**  the renationalization of big chunks of the cap. A lot of decision making will now be  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:32):**  taken in Paris, in Berlin, in Rome on how to distribute cap money. That's a conscious  
**[0:22:37-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:37):**  decision from the European Commission to give those powers back and perhaps wash their hands  
**[0:22:41-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:41):**  of some of the public discontent that comes from this policy. As member states put those  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:48):**  plans in place, they can decide to take into account to a greater or lesser extent what  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:53):**  is in the farm to fork strategy. They can decide to get their farming sectors ready  
**[0:22:57-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:22:57):**  for those transitions to less pesticides, less synthetic fertilizer or not. A lot of  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:02):**  that will depend on the strength of civil society within those countries pushing their  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:07):**  governments to do that. The European Commission has said they will ultimately be responsible  
**[0:23:12-0:23:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:12):**  for approving these cap implementation plans that come forward from the different member  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:16):**  states. In doing that, they'll be taking into account what they've put forward in the farm  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:20):**  to fork strategy. The devil is always in the details. They can do that in an authoritative  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:26):**  way or they can do that in a very lenient way, depending on how much political pressure  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:31):**  they feel. Let's be clear, if the cap does nothing to prepare these transitions to get  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:37):**  farmers ready and moving towards reductions in use of synthetic inputs, then the goals  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:42):**  in the farm to fork strategy simply won't be reached.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:44):**  It's interesting to hear you talking about the way in which the Commission, through its  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:49):**  cap reform, is devolving delivery back to individual member states and that that's become  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:54):**  something that's important within the European Union. And I guess part of it is going to  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:23:59):**  be looking at how individual member states, individual member state governments, look  
**[0:24:04-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:04):**  at agriculture and look at the way that they want to manage their economic futures. And  
**[0:24:09-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:09):**  so there'd be competition between the need for or desire for short term profit to continue  
**[0:24:15-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:15):**  keeping food prices low, addressing that food security question versus the long term cost  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:23):**  of these external impacts associated with agriculture and how forward thinking individual  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:29):**  governments are. And I wonder if either of you have any thoughts about where that leadership  
**[0:24:33-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:33):**  is likely to come at a member state level.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:35):**  I think it's a very good question, but a tough one. And one thing we must say before that  
**[0:24:41-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:41):**  we should not forget that all member states are on a common market for agricultural goods,  
**[0:24:48-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:48):**  which means that basically when a member state takes one decision in one direction, for example,  
**[0:24:54-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:24:54):**  being not being ambitious and, you know, providing a lot of support without any conditionalities,  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:00):**  it gives in a way a sort of comparative advantage to its farmers. And in turn, because all those  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:06):**  farmers are competing on the very same market and all those farmers are producing more and  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:10):**  more and more and more because we are intensifying production, they need export outlets. So whatever  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:15):**  a country does, it does in effect affect what another can do. And I will take a very concrete  
**[0:25:21-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:21):**  example, not because I'm French, but because it's the French reality. Back in 2018, the  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:27):**  French government decided to ban neo-nico-teno-id before all the rest of member states. So it  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:33):**  was mandatory, but France did that a bit earlier than others, which eventually resulted in  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:39):**  some French farmers becoming less competitive than others, and their production costs had  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:45):**  to rise a little bit. And I mean, for French farmers, it's like, well, fair enough, I'm  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:49):**  happy to contribute to environmental advancements. But if it's at the cost of my viability from  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:53):**  a economic point of view, I'm not playing that game. So just to say that the risk we  
**[0:25:58-0:26:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:25:58):**  are running, and it's a real risk, and I mean, we already experienced that in 2013, is a  
**[0:26:03-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:03):**  race to the bottom. That's what we are facing now. And so thinking about who's going to  
**[0:26:08-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:08):**  lead in terms of, you know, being like more ambitious than others is fine. But we should  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:13):**  probably raise the question the other way around, who's going to lead in being very,  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:18):**  very little ambitious, and then bringing all of those member states down to something very  
**[0:26:22-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:22):**  little with very little ambition.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:24):**  So within that, that sounds like it's an argument for a sort of continuation of that EU-wide  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:31):**  approach that we've been used to, and that you're concerned that the risk perhaps of  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:36):**  delegating this to member state level is too great.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:39):**  That's exactly what I say. And when you raise that point with DiGiegli, what they say is  
**[0:26:44-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:44):**  basically no worries, we're going to make sure that the strategic national plans for  
**[0:26:49-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:49):**  the current implementation of the national level will fit with overall EU objectives.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:54):**  But I mean, we've no idea how they are going to do that on the one hand. On the other hand,  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:26:59):**  we have a clear idea about the fact that the political legitimacy of the European Commission  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:03):**  is declining. So the extent to which the European Commission will be able to oppose national  
**[0:27:08-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:08):**  strategic plan, which is not ambitious enough, for me is really loud.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:11):**  So I would say we probably need to keep sort of overarching ambition at the EU level, and  
**[0:27:17-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:17):**  make sure that member states individually do not have too much capacity to reallocate  
**[0:27:23-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:23):**  firms without strong, you know, premise.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:25):**  Nick, I'm going to come to you. Do you think there is that need for a much stronger framework  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:30):**  at commission level? Or do you think that it's possible that that kind of member state  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:34):**  led approach could work?  
**[0:27:36-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:36):**  I'm sceptical about the member state approach. And I think Pierre Marie hit the nail on the  
**[0:27:40-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:40):**  head when he said race to the bottom. Again, we have an example already in rural development  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:45):**  schemes where member states have been able to really do what they want and allocate the  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:49):**  money in different ways. Before I mentioned this, this has yielded some very positive  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:53):**  experimentation with agri-environment schemes. On the other hand, it has also shown that  
**[0:27:57-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:27:57):**  most member states when given this flexibility, pour that money into increasing their competitiveness,  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:04):**  very business as usual kind of investments in farm productivity and infrastructure. So  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:09):**  I don't have very high hopes that it's also hard to see where the leadership will come  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:13):**  from. To make this work, you'd really need the biggest producing nations like France,  
**[0:28:18-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:18):**  Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, really to all take this seriously and to be competing  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:23):**  to be the most sustainable. It's very hard to see that happen. It's a very uneven state  
**[0:28:28-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:28):**  of affairs. If you're looking at agri-environment schemes, France has maybe done more than other  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:34):**  countries there. If you're looking at phasing out antimicrobials in livestock, the Dutch  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:39):**  have done that fairly successfully and kind of got consumers on board. If you're looking  
**[0:28:43-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:43):**  at getting organic food into schools and public canteens, the Copenhagen region in Denmark  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:49):**  has done a fantastic job. It's bitty. It's very hard to really find an example of a country  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:54):**  or even a major region that has done all of these things well and has really pinned its  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:28:59):**  flag to the mast in terms of a transition to sustainable food systems.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:03):**  I wonder if we can sort of look ahead five years. We've got the cap that was essentially  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:07):**  reformed and developed under the old commission. You've got the Green Deal and Farm to Fork  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:12):**  coming in with the new commission. In five years' time, will anything have changed, do  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:16):**  you think, at field level?  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:18):**  Well, my sense is that we are likely to continue the two processes that have led to the situation  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:24):**  in which we are, which is on the one hand, intensification of the most productive areas  
**[0:29:29-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:29):**  and on the other hand, a gradual abandonment of the disproductive areas with all which  
**[0:29:34-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:34):**  comes with, which is like disappearance of extensive plant grasslands that are host of  
**[0:29:39-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:39):**  high biodiversity species. So that's my expectations. We don't have any great, I would say, aspects  
**[0:29:47-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:47):**  of the cap that could prevent the European land use to move in different directions than  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:52):**  what it has been moving on for the last decade.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:29:55):**  So that sounds like a continuing intensification of the majority of agricultural land with  
**[0:30:01-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:01):**  a bit of set aside for nature, a bit of abandonment perhaps leading to rewilding by default, but  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:09):**  a continuation effectively of what's been a sparing approach, which to me seems really  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:14):**  inefficient when actually the majority of land could be delivering the multiple outcomes  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:18):**  we were talking about before. Nick, where do you think we're going to be in five years?  
**[0:30:23-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:23):**  I agree with Pierre-Marie. I think we're going to be continuing the same direction of travel,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:27):**  which is not a good one. It's not seeing the type of change or the pace of change that  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:32):**  we need. I think the cap reforms as they look right now will mean that some medium-sized  
**[0:30:38-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:38):**  bigger farms will be able to stay in business, but really just delaying the inevitable and  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:43):**  not transitioning in their practices, staying in business largely as a result of these subsidies.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:48):**  And that's really something no farmer wants to do. And delaying that transition that would  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:53):**  need to happen for them to increase productivity by improving the soil health and improving  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:30:59):**  the situation with regards to biodiversity. And also delaying what is inevitable in terms  
**[0:31:05-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:05):**  of how markets are evolving, because markets I think will increasingly reward different  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:10):**  niches of production, particularly those who are producing more sustainably. And we would  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:15):**  need policies to be getting farmers ready to connect to those opportunities. And we're  
**[0:31:19-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:19):**  not seeing that. So I think very much business as usual, and unfortunately business as usual,  
**[0:31:24-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:24):**  means the continued disappearance of a lot of smaller and less competitive farms.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:29):**  I'd like to come back to the UK, move back across the English Channel. I wonder, looking  
**[0:31:34-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:34):**  from the outside, whether the EU are aware of what's happening in the UK around land  
**[0:31:40-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:40):**  use and agricultural policy.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:42):**  Well, as a matter of fact, we've been working with different organisations in the UK to  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:47):**  develop an agricultural scenario for the UK, which will be published hopefully by early  
**[0:31:52-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:52):**  January at the Oxford Real Farm Conference. So we do have a look at it. One of the key  
**[0:31:59-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:31:59):**  points besides the fact that what we've demonstrated and what will be published is that an agricultural  
**[0:32:05-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:05):**  UK is possible from a food, biodiversity and a carbon perspective. That's the key result.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:12):**  Beyond that, I think one of the key questions that the UK people will have to address in  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:16):**  the coming probably weeks and months is how do they want to relate to the rest of the  
**[0:32:21-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:21):**  world from a trade perspective? Because the choice or the choices that could be made on  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:25):**  that respect will have a definitive impact on what farmers can do and what could be the  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:31):**  role of the public money for public goods you are mentioning for farmers to really deliver  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:36):**  on different objectives.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:38):**  If there are things that the UK gets right, is there an incentive at EU level, at a Commission  
**[0:32:43-0:32:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:43):**  level to be able to cherry pick some of those things and learn from them and embed them  
**[0:32:48-0:32:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:48):**  in the future and at the same time see the things that we don't get quite right and learn  
**[0:32:53-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:53):**  from that as well?  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:54):**  Yeah, I think there is a potential there, particularly in terms of the timing, because  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:32:59):**  the UK is going to be phasing out basic payments, direct payments to farmers over the next kind  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:04):**  of seven year period. And this corresponds more or less to the timing of the next cap  
**[0:33:10-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:10):**  reform. So by the time of the next cap reform, we might have an example just across the channel  
**[0:33:15-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:15):**  of how to do public payments for public goods in a way that works, but we might not. And  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:21):**  I think a lot of people in Brussels are looking with a good degree of scepticism and that  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:27):**  includes myself, scepticism around whether this will actually happen or not. And if you  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:32):**  look at the plans in terms of what the government would like to do in the agricultural sector  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:37):**  and the realities of the post Brexit landscape, and you know, we're seeing reports talking  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:42):**  about higher food prices, potentially lower availability of fruit and vegetables, fresh  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:48):**  foods, potential reductions of standards, if the UK is going to be doing trade deals  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:53):**  with the US and other countries that do have lower food safety standards than the EU, then  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:33:58):**  it is really hard to square that with an agricultural policy that is positioning the UK as a pioneer,  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:05):**  encouraging farmers to produce in a sustainable way to treat farm workers well, to take on  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:10):**  costs that would need to be rewarded in terms of the prices they'll receive. So it's just  
**[0:34:16-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:16):**  very hard to square those things. And I think there is a good degree of scepticism around  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:19):**  whether this will actually work and whether the UK will be able to chart this different  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:24):**  course between the European model with its high standards and high regulations and a  
**[0:34:30-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:30):**  very deregulated model. And I think that there's a quite well founded fear that this public  
**[0:34:34-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:34):**  goods approach will be kind of slowly jettisoned or watered down as the pressures to produce  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:40):**  competitively in a post Brexit marketplace are brought to bear. I would like to draw  
**[0:34:45-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:45):**  a sort of parallelism with what's going on in the EU, because in the EU, you have the  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:49):**  cap reforms, and then you have this more cross sectoral farm to fork strategy taking shape.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:54):**  In the UK, you have the debate around the agriculture bill, but you also have a UK food  
**[0:34:59-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:34:59):**  strategy that's been put forward in part this year, and I think we'll be seeing more of  
**[0:35:03-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:03):**  it early next year. And when we look at questions like trade, they take on a very different  
**[0:35:07-0:35:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:07):**  complexion when we're looking at them in the context of a broader strategy for the future  
**[0:35:12-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:12):**  of food systems in the EU or the UK. And so if the UK food strategy is really taken seriously  
**[0:35:18-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:18):**  by the government, we'll know, you know, what are the priorities? Is the priority a war  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:22):**  on obesity? Are we going to be really trying to connect farmers to local markets to use  
**[0:35:27-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:27):**  public procurement to really spark a transition to sustainability? Are we going to be raising  
**[0:35:32-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:32):**  standards that way and raising environmental performance? And if we are, then it doesn't  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:37):**  make sense to sacrifice all that for the sake of trade agreements. But if we're just looking  
**[0:35:42-0:35:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:42):**  from a purely agricultural point of view, and then it just becomes one sector among  
**[0:35:46-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:46):**  many in a trade negotiation, then those trade offs do get made and they will continue to  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/How-green-is-the-new-CAP-emja75#t=0:35:51):**  get made to the detriment of farmers trying to produce in a sustainable way.

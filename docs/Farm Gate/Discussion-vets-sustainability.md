### Farm Gate  (Sun, 29 Dec 2019 13:22:32)
**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate. In this program, I'm fortunate to be joined by two remarkable people  
**[0:00:05-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:05):**  to discuss how vets can contribute to sustainability.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:09):**  Gudrun Ravitz is a past president of the British Veterinary Association and currently the head  
**[0:00:14-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:14):**  veterinary officer for Simply Health Professionals.  
**[0:00:17-0:00:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:17):**  Laura Chaim is a veterinary consultant from FAI Farms. She also set up Vets Sustain, a  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:22):**  new and enormously important channel for vets to promote ideas, debate emerging science  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:28):**  and to find out more about critical issues such as combating antimicrobial resistance.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:33):**  So first of all, hello to both of you. I'd like to kick off with a question about sustainability.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:40):**  What is it? What does it mean? And how do we know when we got there?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:44):**  I think for me, it's Gudrun, I think for me, if I look to what the British Veterinary  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:49):**  Association has done around sustainable agriculture and what they've defined it as, it's the  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:54):**  point at which we can carry out animal agriculture so that it kind of meets the needs of the  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:00:59):**  present without compromising the ability to meet the needs of the future. So to me, that's  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:04):**  what the sustainability is. But importantly, it's got a number of factors to it. So we  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:09):**  have to be environmentally aware, we have to be ethically aware and it has to be economically  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:13):**  acceptable. But it's also about animal health and welfare. And I think that's really important,  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:19):**  particularly for consumers, but very much for the veterinary profession. If anything  
**[0:01:23-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:23):**  we do sustainably has to have the dimension of animal health and welfare in a positive  
**[0:01:27-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:27):**  light. I think that's right. And I think this is  
**[0:01:30-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:30):**  Laura here. I also, yeah, I absolutely agree with Gudrun on that one. We see in very traditional  
**[0:01:36-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:36):**  definitions of sustainability, such as those from the UN, they frequently include the environment,  
**[0:01:44-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:44):**  social and economic dimensions of sustainability. And that really does for me exclude animals,  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:51):**  particularly domestic animals. So as vets, it's absolutely critical that we include ethics  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:01:56):**  more generally. And that would include both the social dimensions of sustainability as  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:01):**  well as animal health and welfare. It's always struck me that when we look at  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:06):**  debates around sustainability, often they get sort of caught into silos or if you think  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:12):**  about DEFRA, then different government departments. This department does farm animal welfare.  
**[0:02:16-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:16):**  This department does the environment. And I wonder if there is a role for vets in helping  
**[0:02:21-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:21):**  to bring some of those different aspects together, whether it's farm animal welfare, farm animal  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:27):**  health being brought in with the environment and other issues. Do you think that's possible?  
**[0:02:32-0:02:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:32):**  I think it's more than possible. We have to do that. If we take a One Health approach  
**[0:02:37-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:37):**  to everything and certainly the vet profession is on that One Health journey and is implementing  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:44):**  One Health with a lot of stakeholders, it has to tie in the environment. It has to tie  
**[0:02:49-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:49):**  in animal health and welfare. It has to tie in public health. So it is something we must  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:02:54):**  campaign on. And the health and welfare is I think where Laura and I have started. We've  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:00):**  been campaigning animals are sentient. We know they're sentient. And above that, it's  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:05):**  a marker of social progress. So we have to, as the world we live in, think about social  
**[0:03:11-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:11):**  progress as well and animal health and welfare is within that. So all those streams that  
**[0:03:14-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:14):**  we're talking about, environment, people and animals have to come into that sustainable  
**[0:03:19-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:19):**  agenda. So whatever we're doing on a regulation level, on an association level, on a personal  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:24):**  level, I think it has to marry all of those aspects to be sustainable.  
**[0:03:28-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:28):**  I'm going to come back to maybe what leadership looks like in terms of the veterinary profession  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:34):**  and sustainability a bit later. But there's a question around the way in which sustainability  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:40):**  and climate change perhaps in particular has caught the public zeitgeist in the last year  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:45):**  or two. It's suddenly become fashionable to be sustainable in a way that it perhaps wasn't  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:50):**  until the last couple of years. And every company wants to be seen to be doing its own  
**[0:03:55-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:03:55):**  little bit. And this, it strikes me this can lead to overstatements that because companies  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:01):**  want to say something, they oversell what they're actually doing. And this can lead  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:06):**  to greenwash. But I wonder because I think of sustainability as a journey rather than  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:12):**  a destination, that it's something that, you know, no matter how well we're doing, there's  
**[0:04:17-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:17):**  always something we can do better as new information comes along. But does this greenwash challenge,  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:22):**  I mean, do you think it exists in the first place? And do you think that it's an important  
**[0:04:27-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:27):**  part of that journey? Does greenwash lead to better practice?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:31):**  I think there is a problem with greenwash. However, I think public statements by companies  
**[0:04:38-0:04:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:38):**  to improve have to be seen in a positive way. If they're making public statements, that  
**[0:04:45-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:45):**  means they are accountable to the public to do more. And we've seen some great shifts  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:50):**  as a result of sort of what might seem to be knee jerk reactions from companies to step  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:04:55):**  up. There's been, as an example, in the sustainability world on the animal welfare side, there's  
**[0:05:01-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:01):**  been recently the European Chicken Commitment, a group, a large group of NGOs, global NGOs  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:08):**  that are calling on companies to adopt a range of animal welfare measures for grueller chickens.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:15):**  And a number of companies have got on board with that particular commitment, some in a  
**[0:05:21-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:21):**  very measured way backed by science, backed by research in their supply chains. And some  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:26):**  I believe that may have made those statements that affect huge grueller supply chains. That  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:33):**  is a really good thing from my perspective on the whole. However, there are major problems  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:38):**  or major challenges in the future with implementation of some of those standards. But on the whole,  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:45):**  I'd say these statements are objective and they will drive change.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:49):**  I was going to say, Laura, I think you're absolutely right. It's interesting, isn't  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:54):**  it? I mean, especially from the work that you do and what we're looking at with Vet  
**[0:05:57-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:05:57):**  to Sustain, what you're looking at through that and the British Veterinary Association.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:01):**  It's providing that evidence and making sure the veterinary profession is helping companies  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:06):**  with the evidence and challenging them on the evidence. Because the greenwashing, it  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:11):**  starts a conversation at least. And I think people feel so motivated by the climate change,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:18):**  partly because we can see the damage that can be done to our own planet. But also it's  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:23):**  something we can engage with, it's something we can each do. And it's something that  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:27):**  affects every one of us, even at the smallest level. So I think people can engage with it.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:33):**  But the greenwashing thing, at best, you know, it starts a conversation and that's important.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:39):**  But I think, as you said, Laura, we've got to have the research and we've got to have  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:43):**  the evidence. And a lot of it we have that. So we have to use it and we have to challenge  
**[0:06:47-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:47):**  it. So that's where Vets come in, because they're the gatekeepers to a lot of different  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:53):**  people, animal owners and keepers, etc. So we can help with that evidence. But we've  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:06:58):**  got to challenge it as well and stand up and shout about this.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:01):**  So what I'm hearing there is sort of conversations about evidence and accountability. And I suppose  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:06):**  social media, you know, for all its ills can be quite helpful in that way that if companies  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:11):**  overstate, then people can pick them up on things and challenge that and demand that  
**[0:07:17-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:17):**  evidence basis that perhaps would be missing without that immediate opportunity for people  
**[0:07:22-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:22):**  to challenge.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:23):**  Yeah, and so absolutely. So we have to do that and then take that and educate. So we  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:29):**  are in front of animal owners and keepers every day. And we're in front of the public  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:33):**  every day who are interested either in the pet or the animal in front of them and the  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:38):**  wider environment. And they will look to veterinary surgeons and the veterinary team as a source  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:43):**  of evidence and science led. So we have to share that. So sometimes it's about feeling  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:49):**  empowered as a profession to speak with that one voice and share that knowledge to help  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:55):**  others make informed decisions.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:07:57):**  And it's difficult for a layperson sometimes, isn't it? Because, you know, you rely on experts  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:03):**  to be able to sort of help you sift your way through these various different bits of information  
**[0:08:08-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:08):**  and people tend to graze information, you get a little bit of information on a particular  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:14):**  subject and you just you have to assume that's right. So when we're looking at these more  
**[0:08:18-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:18):**  complex issues, we really do rely on experts like vets and other sustainability professionals  
**[0:08:24-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:24):**  to help us sort the wheat from the chaff.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:26):**  I mean, absolutely. And actually, I think that sometimes have to challenge themselves  
**[0:08:31-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:31):**  because we work sometimes in our little micro areas. And even in terms of climate, it's  
**[0:08:36-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:36):**  a big topic. So understanding everything about it is difficult. And we have to be careful  
**[0:08:41-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:41):**  that we don't rely on what we thought we knew. And evidence has moved on, which is why it's  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:46):**  really important to engage with the stuff that say FAI are doing with things that you've  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:51):**  written, Finlow, in the Vet Record that starts that conversation that allows vets to read  
**[0:08:55-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:08:55):**  more, understand more. And I think we're going to talk about vet sustain. But what Laura  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:00):**  has started with vet sustain as well is to allow vets a place to find that evidence and  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:06):**  signpost that evidence to be able to then educate the wider population.  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:11):**  One of the other things that I've really enjoyed about the vet sustain Facebook page in particular  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:15):**  is that ability to be able to have that debate with a whole range of different people. And  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:21):**  one story that came out recently that I think helps to sort of link these two sort of questions  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:27):**  around what is sustainability and greenwash and evidence-based practice and change is  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:35):**  a story that Laura and I were debating on the Facebook page about one big retailer that  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:41):**  has recently announced that its trucks are going to run on cow poo. And my concern was  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:47):**  that this for this to happen, there needs to be a year round supply of cow muck and  
**[0:09:51-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:51):**  that that must come from indoor units. And Laura, you picked me up on that because my  
**[0:09:55-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:09:55):**  you know, my own concern is that indoor units demand more cereal, more protein, potentially  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:00):**  from soy, etc. And so it seemed to me that this was greenwash, but you picked me up straight  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:06):**  away, which was great and said, well, indoor doesn't necessarily mean bad. Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:12):**  A lot of what we do at FAI is about collecting data around outcome measures. So many people  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:18):**  will obviously know about outcome measures, they're looking at the impact of a particular  
**[0:10:23-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:23):**  production system and the species in production, and really focuses on those as being the most  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:30):**  important thing in terms of driving our decisions in agriculture. And so in terms of indoor  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:35):**  outdoor, based on outcome measures approach, it wouldn't really matter what the production  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:38):**  system is, as long as those outcome measures are positive for people, animals and planet.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:44):**  So looking at the environment, looking at animals and animal welfare, and looking at  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:47):**  the people working in those units, as well as the wider community. And so there are some  
**[0:10:52-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:52):**  parts of the world where indoor units, in my view, would currently be the best bet based  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:10:58):**  on outcome measures. Some parts of the world like Saudi Arabia or northern Norway, where  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:04):**  you've got those climatic temperatures and conditions that really would not be conducive  
**[0:11:09-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:09):**  to putting animals outdoors and wouldn't actually be fair to those animals. Some might say that  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:14):**  actually we shouldn't be producing dairy in those regions. That's another debate perhaps.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:19):**  But currently where there is a current demand and a market for dairy in those regions, indoor  
**[0:11:24-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:24):**  may, based on outcome measures, be the best solution. However, that said, in many parts  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:29):**  of the world, New Zealand, Ireland, many parts of England, there is a plentiful supply of  
**[0:11:35-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:35):**  pasture and grazing for dairy cattle. And in which case the outcome measures may inform  
**[0:11:41-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:41):**  us that actually outdoor systems are the best in those situations. And of course, for me  
**[0:11:48-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:48):**  as well, in terms of outdoor agriculture, for dairy cattle, we can then couple regenerative  
**[0:11:55-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:11:55):**  agriculture approaches, which will really drive benefits in terms of animal behaviour,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:02):**  animal behavioural opportunity, biodiversity benefits through planting trees and hedgerows,  
**[0:12:07-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:07):**  building soil fertility, building biodiversity by approaches such as using mixed herbal lays  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:14):**  to benefit insects and pollinators, et cetera. So there's a whole raft of other additional  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:18):**  approaches for outdoor agriculture that could really capitalise on the benefits of livestock  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:23):**  to human society. So I feel like it's in the UK, I think it's a really good discussion  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:28):**  to have about outdoor dairyhood, but it's not as cut and dried when you look at the  
**[0:12:32-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:32):**  global picture.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:33):**  It's interesting. Just sort of focusing on the UK for a moment, because I think it's  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:37):**  interesting in that conversation about outcome measures, whether outcome measures in and  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:41):**  of themselves are sufficient to be able to give us enough information. Because when I  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:46):**  listen to industry, what I'm hearing, at least in terms of dairy, is that you can get really  
**[0:12:51-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:51):**  good health and welfare outcomes from dairy, even when you are indoor. But there are, as  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:12:58):**  you were just outlining there, a lot of other good reasons for having cattle outside.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:02):**  Yeah, and that's where you have to collect outcome measures for the environment, as well  
**[0:13:06-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:06):**  as the social and economic dimensions as well. So indoor units, you would have to be collecting  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:15):**  environmental outcome measures for aspects such as the feed, where it's produced, and  
**[0:13:21-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:21):**  the impact of that feed production. And it may again inform us that that's not sustainable.  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:25):**  So I think you do have to look at the three E's and outcome measures that underpin all  
**[0:13:30-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:30):**  of those three areas.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:32):**  And how does breed fit into that?  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:34):**  Yeah, sure. Again, it comes back to the health and welfare characteristics in terms of outcome  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:40):**  measures. So we would look then at rates of mastitis, lameness, fertility, etc. And it  
**[0:13:45-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:45):**  may be that for certain breeds that those outcome measures are less desirable. I think  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:53):**  in the past, there's been a real focus on production. So post-war, there was a massive  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:13:58):**  drive really for food production. And that led to really a focus on that single measure  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:05):**  of production and productivity. There's been a lot of progress in the dairy industry in  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:10):**  recent years, looking at a more balanced range of traits, including longevity and again,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:16):**  lameness and fertility and mastitis levels, creating some pretty robust breeds out there.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:24):**  There's also recently been much more crossbreeding going on that again capitalises on the benefits  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:28):**  of two different or three different breeds together. But I do think for the future, we  
**[0:14:34-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:34):**  will have to increase that sort of work and look at a much more balanced scorecard of  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:40):**  outcome measures that really just start to prioritise or at least even consider animal  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:46):**  welfare as an equal measure to the economic output. And that won't always be popular,  
**[0:14:51-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:51):**  that will not be a popular opinion. But for vets, I feel it's absolutely imperative. We  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:14:56):**  have an oath to protect animal welfare. And for me, it's absolutely critical that we're,  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:01):**  for example, not performing cesarean sections on the same cow year in, year out. And if  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:07):**  we've got particular animals that are very, very prone to lameness due to confirmation  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:12):**  problems, but she's got very high milk yield, we need to be really looking at the animal  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:16):**  and potentially not taking any replacement heifers off her. Again, not popular opinions  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:21):**  there, but we really should be looking at a much more balanced approach to breed selection.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:27):**  That's really interesting, because that's almost sort of taking us back to a point that  
**[0:15:30-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:30):**  we were making a few moments ago about different prisms and trying to separate out different  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:36):**  elements of sustainability. What you're saying there is that in the past, you know, food  
**[0:15:40-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:40):**  production increasing more for less has been a real driver within agriculture, but that  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:48):**  now the public and government and farmers themselves are looking for a greater range  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:54):**  of outcomes. It's not just about the food production, but about perhaps the public goods  
**[0:15:58-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:15:58):**  that are associated, the environmental outcomes.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:01):**  Just listening to that as well, it's making me think of the less and better, which is  
**[0:16:07-0:16:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:07):**  the approach that came out of the BVA sustainable agriculture, is that, you know, we can have  
**[0:16:12-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:12):**  the discussion on eating less animal protein, which I think we would probably agree is much  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:18):**  more sustainable for a number of reasons, but it's the and better as well, which encapsulates  
**[0:16:22-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:22):**  everything we've been talking about. And it's making sure those outcomes do measure the  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:26):**  and better. As veterinary professions, we have the evidence to give to clients and say,  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:32):**  actually, we need to be eating less animal protein, but we need to be eating the better  
**[0:16:37-0:16:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:37):**  animal protein. So our spend is the same. We are valuing it, but we're valuing the right  
**[0:16:41-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:41):**  reasons. So animal health and welfare, sustainability, biodiversity, the environmental factors, etc.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:48):**  And it's having that evidence and providing those tools, which I think through the sustainable  
**[0:16:51-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:51):**  agricultural policy at BVA, we have been looking at that with the benchmarking around assurance  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:16:59):**  schemes. But as a profession and welfare scientists and others involved in this, we need to make  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:05):**  sure that our measures are robust and collecting exactly what we want them to collect to inform  
**[0:17:10-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:10):**  consumers.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:11):**  Fantastic. Thank you. This is this is a really interesting discussion. Thank you both for  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:16):**  taking part. I'd like to move us on just a little bit, if I may, because that's been  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:20):**  a fantastic introduction to a whole range of different issues. And I'd like to look  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:25):**  at vet sustain and I'd like to look at the British Veterinary Association's sustainable  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:30):**  agriculture policy. Perhaps, Laura, vet sustain. What's who? What's it all about?  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:36):**  Yeah, thanks for the opportunity to talk about it. It's a very new initiative, really. And  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:42):**  it's been a really exciting journey so far. Vet sustain is essentially a collective of  
**[0:17:47-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:47):**  veterinary professionals, that's vets, nurses and paraprofessionals that are passionate  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:53):**  about driving sustainability, both within our own profession and within the sectors  
**[0:17:57-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:17:57):**  that we influence. And really, we're building a bit of a movement here. It's at the moment  
**[0:18:03-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:03):**  been primarily a communications and engagement campaign to build our network. And we do have  
**[0:18:10-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:10):**  a nice growing network of about 600 vets on Facebook and on Twitter and in our monthly  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:17):**  mailing. But also what we hope to do in the new year really is to launch our strategy,  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:23):**  which includes a number of really important initiatives and toolkits that we will develop  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:29):**  with partners to give us an example, what kind of things? Sure, well, the first one  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:33):**  would be based on the demand for our work would be a toolkit that would inform veterinary  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:39):**  professionals and veterinary businesses on reducing the environmental footprint of those  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:43):**  businesses and all veterinary activities. So actually in the practices themselves? In  
**[0:18:47-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:47):**  the practices, exactly. It would consist of, for example, a downloadable handbook that  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:53):**  contains very digestible evidence information about what they can do in practice, but also  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:18:59):**  other sort of more participatory dynamic tools like carbon calculators and self assessments,  
**[0:19:06-0:19:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:06):**  for example, that would really help businesses to make meaningful changes in reducing their  
**[0:19:11-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:11):**  environmental footprint. And also potentially also we're looking at sort of companion handbooks  
**[0:19:16-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:16):**  that would help vets to advise farmers, equine clients, exotics clients and pet owners on  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:26):**  actually reducing the footprint of ownership of those particular animals. So allowing vets  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:31):**  to really deliver advice that's again, evidence based and looking at the populations and systems  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:38):**  of husbandry for those particular animals in order to reduce our footprint. So my next  
**[0:19:43-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:43):**  question is why vet sustain is necessary? Because are you working alongside the BVA?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:49):**  Is the BVA not doing enough on this? I think the BVA has done some fantastic work around  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:19:54):**  sustainability. They are ultimately a membership organisation and are driven by their membership.  
**[0:20:00-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:00):**  And vet sustain is separate to the BVA, but we're really lucky that we have Simon Docherty,  
**[0:20:06-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:06):**  the senior vice president on our steering group, as well as Gudrun and Sean Wensley  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:12):**  as well, who are past presidents. So we have... Gosh, there's a full line up there. It's almost  
**[0:20:16-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:16):**  like three series of the crown or crowns. It's like the old BVA dream team, I say. Meet  
**[0:20:22-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:22):**  Sean and Simon. Yeah, exactly. But those guys have been huge champions of our work and really  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:28):**  supportive. But I would say, you know, we're not directly affiliated per se with the BVA  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:34):**  other than that support, but they really have been fantastic in supporting our launch. What  
**[0:20:39-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:39):**  we can do slightly differently to the BVA is to drive a number of initiatives with resources  
**[0:20:46-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:46):**  that we can hopefully glean from various sponsors. And we can also have some really difficult  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:52):**  conversations that we feel are necessary. And I think a slightly separate organisation  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:20:57):**  like vet sustain is able to have those difficult conversations around things like populations  
**[0:21:02-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:02):**  of animals that will, you know, that is difficult to talk about because they're our clients.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:09):**  And I think that's where we that's where our niche sits, really.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:12):**  Interesting. Thank you. And Gudrun, you led the BVA as president, as we were hearing then,  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:18):**  and the BVA has its new sustainable agricultural policy. Could you pull out a few highlights  
**[0:21:23-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:23):**  from that, where that's come from and where you think it's going?  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:26):**  I mean, I think, you know, it started way back in with Vet Futures a long time ago,  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:31):**  with vets taking charge of their future and realising that we absolutely have a voice  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:36):**  and we need to talk on topics that are important to animal health and welfare, but also to  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:41):**  the veterinary profession. And it was quite obvious that sustainable animal agriculture  
**[0:21:46-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:46):**  is one of those that we absolutely need to have one voice on. We need to be a force for  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:52):**  change in it. And I think, you know, as an integral part in the agriculture and food  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:21:57):**  sector, the veterinary profession is very well aware that animal agriculture is a significant  
**[0:22:04-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:04):**  contributor to climate change, habitat loss, etc. And it's for us as veterinary professionals  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:12):**  who are evidence based and science led to work with stakeholders to make those changes  
**[0:22:16-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:16):**  that we need to make, but also to help inform consumers. So the sustainable agriculture  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:22):**  policy came out as a stakeholder group led by the BVA, working with a number of our species  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:28):**  divisions, but also external stakeholders as well, to really look at what, A, what it  
**[0:22:34-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:34):**  means to the veterinary profession, but B, come up with some really tangible recommendations  
**[0:22:39-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:39):**  that the veterinary profession can both advocate for at various levels, but also individual  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:45):**  veterinary surgeons and individual veterinary practices can go out there and make a change.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:51):**  So some of the things that we've talked about in there is around advocating on policies  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:22:58):**  as we move forward, particularly around habitats, biodiversity, protecting the environment,  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:04):**  but also the role of veterinary surgeons as educators, as sign posters, and…  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:10):**  And are vets prepared to be that? Are they prepared to play that leadership role out  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:15):**  in the field? I do know, I believe they are. You know,  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:18):**  when we ask vets, and so the British Veterinary Association asks vets what they think is important,  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:22):**  and 89% of them said that they think the veterinary profession should play a more active role  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:27):**  in the sustainability agenda. So I would say that from our membership we have a mandate  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:33):**  from them for the BVA to do it, but also a clear signal that they want to be more active  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:37):**  in it. And I think what we perhaps haven't done before, which we are doing now, is providing  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:42):**  those tools both through what the BVA team and also the Texas AIM is doing, to allow  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:47):**  them then to have those conversations. But it's not just having those conversations,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:51):**  it's empowering them that the rest of the veterinary profession thinks it's fair, because  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:23:55):**  we have a policy position statement on it. And I think if we can give vets that voice  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:01):**  and give vets that confidence and backing, I think they are ready to do that, because  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:06):**  they see the effect on environment, the effect on people, and the effect on animals.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:11):**  And so clearly the Sustainable Agriculture Policy is a really good example of leadership.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:17):**  You've talked about there, you know, multiple stakeholders working together, this being  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:21):**  a process which has taken a number of years to achieve. I'm still sort of curious about  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:26):**  how that actually then translates on the ground and how that leadership emerges, because,  
**[0:24:33-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:33):**  you know, there's a cost associated with visits from vets, you know, vets certainly  
**[0:24:38-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:38):**  on the farms that are perhaps less well, less actively managed for health and welfare. The  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:45):**  vets won't be coming on there on a regular basis. So is it possible for somebody, you  
**[0:24:50-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:50):**  know, in the Yorkshire Dales or something to get out there and feel confident in challenging  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:24:56):**  farmers on some of their behaviours, challenging them on some of their land management? How  
**[0:25:02-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:02):**  do they go about doing that?  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:03):**  Yeah, so I think we do need to look at it and the whole policy in three areas. So there's  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:07):**  the individual veterinary surgeon, there's the practice level and then there's the association  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:11):**  level. So you're absolutely right, there are some harder to reach, perhaps farms or harder  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:15):**  to reach practices of agriculture that we may wish to change that we find hard. And  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:22):**  perhaps that's more on an association level, taking it to government and saying, look,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:26):**  are the regulations effective? Are they appropriate? Do we need to do something? Bearing in mind  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:31):**  that we're looking at potentially brand new policies coming through, how do we as vets  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:36):**  give the evidence? And I think we have that evidence now and through advocating and lobbying,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:41):**  the veterinary profession can play its part at that level. And that may help to bring  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:46):**  actually the bottom to a standard that is more acceptable. But I think where vets as  
**[0:25:51-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:51):**  individuals play a role is educators. So they are the people that are on those farms, they  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:25:56):**  have an intimate relationship with those animal owners and keepers. And they are the ones  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:00):**  that are potentially able to signpost the information, have the conversations about,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:06):**  look, this is the way we're doing it now, but if we were to do it this way, this is  
**[0:26:10-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:10):**  the benefit. This is how I can help you. Again, looking at the outcomes. So animal health  
**[0:26:15-0:26:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:15):**  and welfare outcomes are fantastic ways of saying, look, we have a benchmark, how can  
**[0:26:19-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:19):**  we approve? This is how we can audit it. But also perhaps more on environmental outcomes  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:24):**  that we haven't looked at before. And I think for individuals, again, it's that education  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:29):**  piece. So I think we can, as trusted partners with farms, but I accept that sometimes that  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:37):**  is harder and we have to work at an association level to advocate for better at the base layer.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:43):**  But also I think practices can really help with this. So practice policies, but absolutely  
**[0:26:50-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:50):**  instil the confidence in farms that this is what the practice believes. Practice education,  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:26:56):**  the distributing education materials that practices that farms can believe in, that  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:01):**  are science-led and evidence-based. And also at practice level, doing that local advocacy  
**[0:27:07-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:07):**  work with politicians, key stakeholders, farming advocates, et cetera. So I think we need to  
**[0:27:12-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:12):**  look at it at three levels, but I think we shouldn't underestimate the sort of privileged  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:18):**  relationship that vets can have as educators. And Laura, I was going to say, Laura, that  
**[0:27:25-0:27:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:25):**  it seems to me that FAI has a role in that as well. That in addition to the BVA policy  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:31):**  and the work with vets, that there's an opportunity to link up that renewed vision and leadership  
**[0:27:37-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:37):**  from vets with retailer contracts and outcome measures and work that's actually taking place  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:44):**  on the ground. So that there's this pincer action taking place for better sustainability.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:50):**  And one example I think that we've touched on amongst ourselves in the past is around  
**[0:27:55-0:28:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:27:55):**  liver fluke and the way that you can try and manage liver fluke simply by medicinal approaches,  
**[0:28:02-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:02):**  health approaches. But if you change land management and try and dry out certain spaces,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:09):**  fence off wet areas and manage animal livestock access to those wetter areas, then potentially  
**[0:28:15-0:28:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:15):**  the combination of better land management and medicines can lead to a real reduction  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:23):**  in liver fluke outbreak. Yeah, absolutely. I think there's a real  
**[0:28:26-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:26):**  role for vets in looking at land use as a tool for driving improvements in animal health.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:34):**  And again, you mentioned drugs there. I think as the veterinary model, the veterinary practice  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:39):**  model has to in coming years change from being reliant on drug sales through to reliance  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:44):**  on more services. We can see an opportunity here to bring in different types of services  
**[0:28:51-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:51):**  that might include the empire of crotchethals, land management and other aspects of environmental  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:28:58):**  stewardship on farms. And also we're in a really interesting point in history as well,  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:03):**  where we may see in the UK a change in subsidy structures on farms, which may allow farmers  
**[0:29:08-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:08):**  to bring in more expertise in terms of environmental and their properties. And this may be an opportunity  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:16):**  to vet for vets as well, dovetailing into our new sort of new service structure may  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:23):**  allow us to capitalise on that and advise on boosting public goods on farms. So not  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:28):**  only environmental stewardship, but also animal welfare, of course, and fundamentally, which  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:36):**  is of real interest to me as I'm currently studying for a PhD in antimicrobial usage,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:41):**  looking at driving reductions in antimicrobial usage and looking at systems, system level  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:48):**  change in order to achieve improvements in these public goods.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:51):**  I think it's interesting, isn't it? Because a lot of what I think we're talking about  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:54):**  is behavioural change and that kind of behavioural change management from moving from where we  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:29:59):**  have been to where we kind of want to go. I think the really interesting piece for vets  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:04):**  there is providing that evidence, and I know I keep talking about that, but it's providing  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:09):**  that evidence base to it and the education that people can trust to help that behavioural  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:14):**  change to happen. And I think you're right, Laura, subsidies could well be changing and  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:20):**  certainly at an association level. I know the BVA is advocating strongly on the environmental  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:25):**  stewardship, animal health and welfare, public health and others, so that they form part  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:31):**  of that subsidy package. But I think on the ground, behavioural change really matters  
**[0:30:36-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:36):**  and vets can play a really key role in that. So let's go into that role just very slightly  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:42):**  more deeply. So you can call out a vet onto your farm and that vet could give you advice  
**[0:30:47-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:47):**  and that may be around drugs and it may be around land management, it may combine those  
**[0:30:52-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:52):**  things, but you've still got to call that vet out. And if you're a farmer that is making  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:30:57):**  very little money, then there is an incentive not to do that, if there's a cost associated.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:01):**  So are there ways that vets can help those farmers? Are there different models of veterinary  
**[0:31:07-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:07):**  support that can be offered in the countryside? And I think we have to find those. We are  
**[0:31:14-0:31:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:14):**  currently talking over the internet. I think vets are very well aware of innovation and  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:21):**  technology changes, meaning that we need to get away sometimes from the brick and mortar  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:25):**  aspect of what we do and the actual face-to-face aspect of what we do for the palm of hand  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:30):**  aspect so we have those relationships through the palm of hand, which allows us to reach  
**[0:31:35-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:35):**  out to more and educate more in a more timely way and a cost-effective way on both sides.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:42):**  So I think we need to make sure that we're owning that educational space. I think we  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:46):**  need to look at how we change our business models in practices, particularly in the agricultural  
**[0:31:51-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:51):**  sector, so that we become more ingrained within businesses, so that we are seen as, you know,  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:31:58):**  we're there as a cost, but actually we provide them to, we give them the ability to make  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:32:03):**  more profits in the end.  
**[0:32:07-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Discussion---Vets--sustainability-e9t31j#t=0:32:07):**  Well that's all we have time for. I'd like to thank my guests, Laura Higham and Gudrun

### Farm Gate  (Mon, 13 Apr 2020 17:46:50)
**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:09):**  Throughout any normal year, food aid providers such as food banks and food kitchens ensure  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:15):**  that nutritious food and meals are available for people and families in crisis and for  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:20):**  the working poor. These facilities are often run by staff but are usually supported by  
**[0:00:24-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:24):**  a multitude of community volunteers.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:27):**  Coronavirus has led to lockdown, the loss of work, jobs and income. It has forced people  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:33):**  with little or no savings to turn to strangers, to outside charities and institutions just  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:39):**  to be able to eat.  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:41):**  Food aid providers already working to capacity have had to swiftly adapt their service models  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:46):**  to cope with the influx of new, fearful, hungry and potentially infected people.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:52):**  In this programme, I'll speak to three people working to provide food at the frontline of  
**[0:00:57-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:57):**  the social crisis caused by pandemic and by governmental attempts to contain the coronavirus.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:03):**  Later I'll speak to Greg Silverman, the Executive Director of the West Side Campaign  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:07):**  Against Hunger in New York City, and Mark Game, the Chief Executive of the Bread and  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:12):**  Butter Thing, a community-led charity in Greater Manchester, UK.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:16):**  But first I spoke to Dee Woods. Dee runs Granville Community Kitchen in Kilburn, London. She  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:22):**  is the Chair of the Independent Food Aid Network and she sits on the London Food Board. I asked  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:28):**  her how coronavirus has affected Granville Community Kitchen.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:33):**  One, the demand has literally doubled and as this crisis deepens we expect it to be  
**[0:01:41-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:41):**  worse. We're doing a lot more deliveries. We've always had a percentage of deliveries  
**[0:01:47-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:47):**  to people, especially older people and disabled people, but that has increased. We're also  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:57):**  seeing an increase of people who aren't within the local borough, so we're delivering  
**[0:02:02-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:02):**  to Westminster and Camden and getting people from that borough as well, because there isn't  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:10):**  anything else in the area except us.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:13):**  Is it still the same sort of people that are coming to you or have you seen a great change  
**[0:02:18-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:18):**  in the types of people that are coming to you?  
**[0:02:21-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:21):**  I think we've seen a great change. We're seeing a lot more families and I think that's  
**[0:02:26-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:26):**  because they're not accessing the help through the free school meals. A lot of those families  
**[0:02:33-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:33):**  are self-isolating and with the voucher scheme, it means they have to travel to particular  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:41):**  supermarkets which we don't have locally and the food being offered by the schools wasn't  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:48):**  necessarily what they might eat. We're also in an area with a lot of people who are no  
**[0:02:54-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:54):**  recourse for public funds, so that group is still coming, but we're seeing a lot more  
**[0:03:01-0:03:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:01):**  people, a lot more families, a lot more people who are working and can't access any finances.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:09):**  They don't have any savings and they've literally run out of food.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:13):**  And the people who are coming now, the newer people who are coming in, do you think that  
**[0:03:17-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:17):**  these are largely people from the gig economy or are they people regularly in work in a  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:22):**  different way, but they just simply physically aren't able to work as a result of the pandemic  
**[0:03:27-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:27):**  lockdown?  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:28):**  Yes, we're seeing a lot more people like that, definitely. What we have seen a reduction  
**[0:03:33-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:33):**  in are a lot of people who were destitute and homeless and that's because the GLA and  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:42):**  local authorities have been taking people off the street and putting them into temporary  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:47):**  accommodation. But what we found is that we're delivering to those places because they haven't  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:54):**  really sourced the supply of food yet, so we're delivering food parcels to temporary  
**[0:04:00-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:00):**  parcels. So you've got two sort of parts of what you  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:03):**  do. One is providing meals for people who come to you and the other is catering for  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:08):**  packaging meals and taking them to people who are self isolating. How do you ensure  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:14):**  that your staff and that the people who are coming to you and that you're delivering to  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:19):**  stay safe? We're following all the guidelines that have  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:24):**  come down. So we're wearing PPE stuff, we're maintaining a two metre distance. We pack  
**[0:04:32-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:32):**  everything and we place it on a table so there's no contact. We have a high sanitisation routine,  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:40):**  which we have anyway because we're providing food, but just that we're extending it to  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:46):**  other surfaces that we wouldn't normally do. So like door handles, other areas where we  
**[0:04:52-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:52):**  wouldn't normally have to do that. With deliveries, people are wearing masks and gloves and aprons.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:02):**  They don't enter anyone's homes. They put the food on the doorstep and let people know  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:09):**  that food has arrived and they step back two metres.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:12):**  And obviously you're on the front line of providing this really very basic fundamental  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:18):**  service to people at this time of crisis. Do you feel confident that you're safe in  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:26):**  these activities? I think we're safe for now. My concern is  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:31):**  as food supplies dry up and as it is, we're struggling to access food supplies, whether  
**[0:05:38-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:38):**  it's surplus or whether we're buying it because we are having to buy food as well, that people  
**[0:05:45-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:45):**  will start becoming violent. And I have heard from other food aid providers within the IFAN  
**[0:05:53-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:53):**  network that people are becoming unruly. So physical violence is a concern.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:03):**  And why is that? Why are people becoming more violent? Is it because you're not able to  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:08):**  provide the food that they're expecting or is there something else going on?  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:11):**  I think it's just desperation. When people are hungry and we deal with a lot of people  
**[0:06:18-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:18):**  who call up and say, I haven't eaten for several days. So it is a matter of fear and insecurity  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:27):**  that people will become violent. Now you said that your food supplies in themselves  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:33):**  are vulnerable. Where do you normally get food from and how has that changed as a result  
**[0:06:38-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:38):**  of the pandemic? So with Granville Community Kitchen, we've  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:43):**  had a mixture of sources. So we work directly with some farmers and sort of local growers  
**[0:06:50-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:50):**  to access food, as well as some that we've grown ourselves and some we buy and some from  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:57):**  the food surplus. So I think we're a bit more resilient than a lot of other projects, but  
**[0:07:05-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:05):**  it is a struggle right now to actually get enough food to feed 200 people. Because we  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:16):**  supply food on a weekly basis, we pack parcels that will support people weekly. Getting that  
**[0:07:24-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:24):**  volume of food several times a week is difficult. So people, if they're coming to you and they're  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:30):**  expecting to get food parcels to take away, then that's food that will last them across  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:36):**  that week to come. Yes. And we have to bear in mind that for  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:40):**  a lot of people, food insecurity also means that they don't have refrigeration or they  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:46):**  don't have the means to cook. So because they're not hostile or, you know, their landlords  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:53):**  won't let them have anything beyond a microwave. So we have to have a mixture of food that  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:00):**  we can give to people. And if people don't have refrigeration of  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:04):**  their own or don't have cooking facilities, is there some community equivalent that they're  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:11):**  able to use at all? Or is it simply that they just need to keep a carrier bag of food in  
**[0:08:16-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:16):**  their rooms and fend for themselves a bit? A combination. So we've managed to get, you  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:22):**  know, more refrigeration equipment and we will store, you know, some stuff for people.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:29):**  We used to be able to have people come in and prepare food, which they would then take  
**[0:08:35-0:08:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:35):**  back, but we can't do that anymore. So it is a dire situation. And when you add in the  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:43):**  medically vulnerable, you know, to, to that mix, it literally is a recipe for disaster.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:51):**  And are there still people that, that you're aware of, that you see in the community that  
**[0:08:56-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:56):**  are somehow falling through the gaps, not only in terms of your own provision, but council  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:01):**  provision and other, other food kitchen provision? I think there'll always be people falling  
**[0:09:06-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:06):**  through the gaps. And it tends to be people who are no recourse to public funds. People  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:14):**  who would not trust the authorities and would be totally dependent on unrestricted projects  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:21):**  like mine. And some of those people have disappeared. You know, they have gone to ground because  
**[0:09:27-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:27):**  they fear being detained. When you talk about people with no recourse  
**[0:09:32-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:32):**  to public funds, who do you mean? Refugees and other migrants who most often  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:39):**  don't have the right to work and don't have the right to access any benefits. If, you  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:46):**  know, migrants and refugees were able to work, that would lift them out of poverty and then  
**[0:09:52-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:52):**  they would not have to come to food banks and depend on charity for all essentials for  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:59):**  their life. And do people have to pay for the services  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:02):**  that you're providing or is it entirely free? It is entirely free.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:06):**  Now, when you talk about people potentially becoming more violent as food scarcity means  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:14):**  that you're unable to provide the services at the volume that's required by people. What  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:19):**  are your concerns there? How do you keep the people that are working with you safe?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:24):**  I mean, I've literally done a risk assessment. So we're set up in a way that if, you know,  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:31):**  people do become violent, that we're able to shut ourselves in. We only allow one person  
**[0:10:39-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:39):**  at a time to come to the point of collection and building we're in. It is pretty safe.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:47):**  So we are able to lock ourselves in if need be.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:51):**  So you're sort of building in those defences on the assumption that this level of violence  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:58):**  may escalate in the future, which is really very worrying.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:01):**  Yeah. And I know there's some people who've asked, well, can we have the army or police  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:07):**  presence? But I don't think we're quite there yet.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:12):**  In the normal, you know, in the normal course of affairs, would you anticipate having problems  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:18):**  and violence towards your staff and volunteers? Or is this something that you're fearing specifically  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:24):**  as a result of the coronavirus pandemic? I mean, we have had people who have been quite,  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:30):**  you know, violent or abusive. And we're fortunate that, you know, there's someone in centre  
**[0:11:38-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:38):**  who we can call on and with a security specialist. So he's been really great at sort of defusing  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:46):**  situations. I think, you know, if it is a group of people, we aren't prepared really  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:52):**  to deal with that other than having to lock ourselves in and call the police. Yeah.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:00):**  Now Dee, you've worked in and around the inner city for a long time. And I wonder if you  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:06):**  were talking to a politician now and you were saying that you had the power to reform the  
**[0:12:10-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:10):**  food system and make access fairer for everybody, what would be your number one top priority?  
**[0:12:17-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:17):**  It would be putting cash in the hands of people. All right. Which means national living wage  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:25):**  should go up or we have some sort of universal income benefits as well need to be upgraded.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:33):**  So child benefit is an easy one. Universal credit that needs upgraded and to remove that  
**[0:12:39-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:39):**  five week wait. I mean, all those measures in terms of reducing poverty need to come  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:46):**  in. And then in terms of food access, right, there are literally areas in the city, in  
**[0:12:52-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:52):**  the country that doesn't have access to good food. So we need to have markets and other  
**[0:13:00-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:00):**  ways of people being able to access good food. And what do you think the government thinks  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:06):**  of organisations like your own? Do you think that food banks and food kitchens are built  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:11):**  into government policy, that they just expect you to pick up the pieces? Or do you think  
**[0:13:16-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:16):**  that there is a real level of impetus within government to try to solve the kinds of problems  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:23):**  that you've been outlining? I think they expect us to pick up in pieces  
**[0:13:29-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:29):**  and especially now, you know, they think, well, OK, we exist so we could handle all  
**[0:13:36-0:13:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:36):**  the food things and the government will handle sort of the identified medically vulnerable.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:43):**  And I don't think we should be existing in policy. We shouldn't have to exist. What we  
**[0:13:48-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:48):**  need in policy is a right to food legislation that would ensure that people are able to  
**[0:13:56-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:56):**  access adequate food, healthy food and culturally appropriate food.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:02):**  Dee Woods from Granville Community Kitchen. Chef Greg Silverman is the executive director  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:08):**  of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, which aims to provide access with dignity  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:13):**  to a choice of healthy food and supportive services in New York City. I asked him to  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:18):**  describe how the West Side Campaign Against Hunger operates.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:22):**  The West Side Campaign Against Hunger, better known as WISCA, created the choice model pantry  
**[0:14:26-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:26):**  over two and a half decades ago. So the best practice model of how you deliver food with  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:32):**  dignity to hungry people, in a sense creating a grocery store that's free, is the model  
**[0:14:36-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:36):**  we created. And we give out almost 50% fresh produce and on top of that fresh milk and  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:42):**  fresh, fresh meats and frozen meats, canned goods and dried goods are part of it. But  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:46):**  those are just staples, right? But that's not the only thing people need. And at the  
**[0:14:49-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:49):**  same time, we have an entire team of social service workers who make sure that beyond  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:54):**  food, food is sort of the first step that people take when they need help. They come  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:58):**  to us and they want food. But we try to find out what are all the public sector benefits,  
**[0:15:03-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:03):**  city, state, federal level that we can help people gain access to. And that's where actually  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:07):**  the real strength of our work lies. We give away 1.7 million pounds of food a year.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:12):**  And who is it that you're catering for on a normal day to day basis, coronavirus apart?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:18):**  What sort of people are they that are that are coming and using the service that you  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:21):**  provide?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:22):**  Over 60% of our customers are Latinx community members. So we have lots of recent immigrants  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:27):**  who come to us or we have about 28% seniors. So lots of hungry New Yorkers who have been  
**[0:15:34-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:34):**  here and paid their dues and worked their years and years and they just still can't  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:38):**  make ends meet. Lots of families with kids. And right, like if you sort of look at the  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:42):**  28% seniors and you look at the families with kids, the number of people who are the working  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:49):**  poor, who are of working age is a minority number. But those people are all usually we  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:54):**  find working. They're working whether it's part time jobs, they're working off the books  
**[0:15:59-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:59):**  because they have different immigration status issues.  
**[0:16:03-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:03):**  Our customers are also going to grocery stores, right? Like the West Side Campaigning as Hunger  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:07):**  and the emergency feeding system in general isn't meant to be the sole source of food  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:10):**  for someone. It sort of helps the top up throughout the month. So whatever someone's benefits  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:16):**  are, whatever work they, money they have, in a sense, we help to stretch their food  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:20):**  dollars further. So we know people are still going to grocery stores, they're going to  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:23):**  soup kitchens, they're going to other locations to get food, but they're doing everything  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:27):**  they can to like it's the hardest job in New York City, right? To be poor is the hardest  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:32):**  job that exists. You travel around your city trying to pull things together to make sure  
**[0:16:36-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:36):**  you can feed your family through not one single mechanism. Like we don't have some strong  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:42):**  safety net. You know, thinking that there's over 700 food pantries in New York City alone.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:46):**  I mean, that's this ragtag and true system of feeding. And by the way, over 30% of those  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:52):**  pantries have closed in the last month because of the coronavirus. So if you think about  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:56):**  that, that tells you how weak and frayed the social safety net is in America, let alone  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:01):**  New York City.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:02):**  You've taken us into the next question, which is how has coronavirus changed the provision  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:08):**  that's being demanded of you?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:09):**  I think we're just starting to scale up. I think, you know, the big issue for most  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:14):**  pantries and frontline organisations is more operational at first. So, for example, by  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:20):**  giving out 50% fresh produce, when that produce comes in by the palette, you know, we go through  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:24):**  it, make sure it's all good, separate it, throw out everything that's bad, bag it up  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:28):**  so it's ready to go for customers. That is taken care of by 1700 volunteers a year. You  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:33):**  know, a month ago, that entire volunteer base was gone. Corporate volunteers ended, school  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:38):**  volunteer groups ended, religious institution volunteer groups ended. And then it was decided  
**[0:17:42-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:42):**  for safety reasons, we need to just stop having volunteers altogether. We're just bringing  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:46):**  them back. So we had to move to a lot more shelf-stable product that was ready to go.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:49):**  And so that, you know, we started spending another $10,000 a week on food alone that  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:55):**  we're buying, not getting donated. Had to bring in more contracts, some more contract  
**[0:17:58-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:58):**  staff to help support this work. So those piece, getting pallet jacks and carts and  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:04):**  things that cost money and the safety precautions for our team, making sure, you know, folks  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:08):**  have masks, that we have tents for when we're outside because of the, like today's rain,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:13):**  that we also know we have staff who have already had staff who have contracted the virus and  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:17):**  who are home for 14 days and some whose spouses have contracted the virus and therefore are  
**[0:18:21-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:21):**  home caring for them. So we've had decreased staff capacity, decreased volunteer capacity,  
**[0:18:27-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:27):**  increased need and having to shift the model. I wouldn't say that scale is the first thing  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:31):**  that's happening, but it's staying afloat and being able to do the good work and not  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:36):**  stop so that our customers have been depending on us for years can continue to depend on  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:40):**  us. And that's not even talking about the coming crush of unemployed people in the service  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:45):**  industry as they go from, you know, even if they got two weeks severance to next step,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:51):**  they're going to apply for unemployment, which they have to wait and then for food stamps  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:55):**  and they have to wait about a month to do that. So it's going to take a while for that  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:58):**  crush to hit us and hopefully we'll be ready to scale up. The community has got our back,  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:04):**  right? And we are finding amazing support happening right now. Luckily we have more  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:08):**  funding coming in in a very strong way right now, but we know if history repeats itself,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:13):**  whether it's from hurricane Sandy or in 2008 or 9-11, like these instances funding comes  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:19):**  in for a series of, for many weeks and then it drops off. And the question will be, you  
**[0:19:24-0:19:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:24):**  know, two months from now, when we go back to our key supporters for our normal money  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:29):**  funds for the year ahead, are they still with us?  
**[0:19:31-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:31):**  Paul  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:32):**  How has the way that you actually give food to people changed as a result of coronavirus?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:37):**  David  
**[0:19:38-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:38):**  Yeah, we created the choice model globally and now we're back to giving pre-bagged kits  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:42):**  of food. There is not a choice for customers right now. We're creating one model and we  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:48):**  give out that for each person gets the same. They get a bag filled with produce, fresh  
**[0:19:55-0:19:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:55):**  with vegetables that's fresh and canned. They get a bag of fruit that's fresh and a couple  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:59):**  of canned. They get a bag of whole grains. That's usually some fresh bread, some pop,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:04):**  a different type of whole grain pasta, a rice, a cereal. There's a bag of proteins. That's  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:09):**  anything from, you know, dried beans, canned beans, canned fish, canned meat. We're still  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:15):**  figuring out how to re-bring back our frozen meats just because it's a question of more  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:19):**  of refrigeration capacity right now. And then the milk right now is shelf-stable milk or  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:24):**  shelf-stable alternative dairy.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:25):**  Paul  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:26):**  And in every community around the world, there are always people that fall through the gaps.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:30):**  How successful are you at the moment in picking up those people who might otherwise be falling  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:34):**  through the gaps?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:35):**  David  
**[0:20:36-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:36):**  I mean, that's our entire business model, right, for the last 40 years is there's no  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:39):**  real safety net for hungry New Yorkers. And so we fill in the gaps, right, like in a perfect  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:45):**  world. And this is in a perfect world, which truthfully is a perfect storm before coronavirus  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:50):**  even of those people who no matter what are still not going to have enough to eat for  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:54):**  themselves and their family. And so we step in to make sure that we can get them extra  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:59):**  food. And I think in coronavirus, that's just it's accentuating every crack in the system.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:04):**  We can compare different countries at some level and say like, wait, what's happening  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:07):**  when you lose your job in the US, you lose your job, right? What kind of benefits are  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:14):**  you really going to be to get right away? And it's not the same as you have in other  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:17):**  countries, right? We're desperately and sadly behind in many ways when it comes to a safety  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:23):**  net for our customers. Like having worked, I worked for the City of London for a number  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:28):**  of years in the UK. And so I know what people in the UK can complain about the decreasing  
**[0:21:33-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:33):**  safety net in the UK, but these are two separate worlds of sad safety nets. You know, people  
**[0:21:40-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:40):**  are on their own here. And so how we get them access is to fill in a sense, get them some  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:47):**  food and help them navigate an incredibly bureaucratic social safety net that doesn't  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:53):**  give that much, but it's really difficult to get access to it. So our team is really  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:58):**  great. Our experts at helping people navigate the system so they can get the sports they  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:03):**  need. Are there lessons that you think New Yorkans or people across America around the  
**[0:22:08-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:08):**  world should really be picking up on and learning as a result of things they're discovering  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:14):**  throughout the pandemic period? I'm a chef who talks a lot about when people are hangry,  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:20):**  right? And how they make bad food choices when they're hangry and how they act out when  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:24):**  they're hangry. The truth of the matter is most people with means have never truly been  
**[0:22:28-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:28):**  hangry and they've never been food insecure and they still get angry. And in the instance  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:32):**  like coronavirus, all these people are going back to eating the worst foods possible because  
**[0:22:37-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:37):**  they're stressed out. Well, we got 40 plus million people in America who are on food  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:42):**  stamps who have been stressed out getting meals well before COVID hit. And it might  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:48):**  be a wake up call to those with means and those in power to understand like how difficult  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:54):**  it is to be in poverty and therefore like what needs to be put in place to help lift  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:58):**  people out of it. Because I don't think we really truly understand how difficult it is.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:02):**  You know, people are complaining now about they're going to run out of toilet paper,  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:05):**  but they're still able to purchase toilet paper. They'll pay any amount for it, but  
**[0:23:09-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:09):**  they have the means. And it's just, it's a chance for people to understand a little bit  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:13):**  what it feels like to not have what you need and to be stressed every day. You use the  
**[0:23:17-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:17):**  term hangry. I'm guessing that's hungry and angry. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:24):**  And so that's, that's kind of saying, well, if, if people are hungry, if people are living  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:28):**  in poverty, then there are just so many extra emotions and, and mental health challenges,  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:36):**  which are layered on top of that, which make life difficult just in the day to day, but  
**[0:23:40-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:40):**  climbing out of that living trough that people have, have found themselves in, it becomes  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:45):**  even more difficult. Totally. And I think we, we, you know, we see this every day. Our  
**[0:23:50-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:50):**  customers are stressed when they come in to visit and we, that's why we make sure we have  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:54):**  a, you know, we put out food, we put out coffee, we put out bagels, we put out different foods,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:58):**  food because you know, they're hungry and they need help. But I also think just, it's,  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:02):**  it's a chance to like, we're seeing that we're able to sort of test out, innovate on new  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:06):**  ideas and it's not about doing things alone, right? It's about partnership and collaboration.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:11):**  And I think we, we have to use this as an opportunity to create a new landscape for,  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:15):**  for how we, we feed hungry people, right? And how we feed our community and the community  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:20):**  is everyone. And we've been doing it, like when I said like 700 food pantries exists  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:25):**  in New York City, like, I don't know what that means. Like, why do we have 700 ad hoc,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:30):**  not part of a formal system method for feeding people that like, this seems like there's  
**[0:24:36-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:36):**  a real problem. Obviously we've been at it for 40 years in emergency feeding. Emergencies  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:41):**  don't last 40 years. That's not, that's not the definition of an emergency. That's a  
**[0:24:45-0:24:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:45):**  definition of a failed system.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:47):**  Greg Silverman from the West Side campaign against hunger. Mark Game is chief executive  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:53):**  of the Bread and Butter thing, which takes surplus food given by industry and redistributes  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:58):**  it through community hubs throughout Greater Manchester. I started by asking him just how  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:03):**  do these food surpluses occur?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:06):**  I suppose the easiest way of trying to think about this is if you ever try to have a dinner  
**[0:25:12-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:12):**  party or just even make a meal for people, you've always got to think about just how  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:16):**  much food you're going to make to make sure everybody's satisfied. And some people will  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:21):**  want seconds and some people won't want the volume of food that you've made. The retailers  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:26):**  in the supermarkets have the same problems every day, but they're trying to feed over  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:30):**  60 million people in the UK every day. And that's a real challenge. So although they  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:35):**  are very sophisticated and they have a lot of forecasting intelligence, et cetera, around  
**[0:25:41-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:41):**  this nowadays, there's still one or 2% of fluctuation. A really easy example is if the  
**[0:25:50-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:50):**  long range forecast is telling us all, I should say pre-COVID, that there's going to be a  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:56):**  nice sunny weekend ahead and we'd all start planning barbecues, then the retailers would  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:00):**  all start ordering the beef burgers and the sausages, et cetera. But then if there's a  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:04):**  freak storm and it rains and nobody buys the food or that food becomes surplus, it's still  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:09):**  on the shelves, nobody's taking it.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:12):**  And so pre-COVID, how would that food be presented to your members or the users?  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:18):**  We use a model that's very much like a veg box scheme. So a veg box scheme would look  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:23):**  at what is seasonal and regional and is available at the time. And they would push that selection  
**[0:26:28-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:28):**  onto the end user. We do the same, but with surpluses. So what we always try and do is  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:33):**  do three bags of food, one of covered goods, cereals, packets, one of fridge goods, such  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:39):**  as dairy or protein or ready meals, and one of fruit and veg. What we don't guarantee  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:45):**  anybody is that we will be able to always provide them with exactly what they want.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:51):**  If people are picky and need to be, need more choice in their life, then our model's not  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:56):**  for them. But if you can have some elasticity of thought around what you could do with food  
**[0:27:01-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:01):**  that is presented to you, that is simply surplus, and that can look like potatoes, sweet potatoes,  
**[0:27:06-0:27:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:06):**  cauliflowers and oranges one week and the following week it could be onions, carrots  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:11):**  and oranges.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:12):**  And are people paying for the service that you provide in the same way that you buy a  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:17):**  veg box? It's just that it's cheaper.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:19):**  Absolutely. So people pay for our service, generally speaking, it's £7.50 for three  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:25):**  bags of food that a retail value would be around £40.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:30):**  And so that helps to fund the services that you're providing, I imagine it's part of your  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:34):**  business model.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:35):**  Exactly. It covers our running costs.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:37):**  And what's the scope of the Bread and Butter project? Because it's not just one outlet,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:42):**  is it?  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:43):**  So we currently have 28 hubs in Greater Manchester and we have two running in Darlington as well  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:49):**  in the Tees Valley now. I guess the scope is that this is very much a supply driven  
**[0:27:54-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:54):**  model. So the more food that we can unlock from the food industry and redistribute, the  
**[0:28:03-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:03):**  larger we can grow.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:04):**  How has coronavirus and the pandemic changed things?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:08):**  The Bread and Butter thing before Covid was very much a community led organisation. So  
**[0:28:14-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:14):**  we would take the food in our vans and we would encourage community volunteers to come  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:21):**  and help us in their community projects across Greater Manchester to come and pack the food  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:26):**  with us. Sadly, post Covid, what we've had to do is retrench. We have to recognise that  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:33):**  some of our volunteers and people in the community were vulnerable. So we have to now pack all  
**[0:28:39-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:39):**  of those bags in the warehouse. So we're much more of a crisis food delivery service than  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:47):**  a community led service now.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:50):**  Obviously there's been a really substantial change in the way that supermarkets have been  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:56):**  ordering their own food for their own retail and the way that people have been buying that  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:00):**  food. Have those surpluses changed as a result of the pandemic?  
**[0:29:05-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:05):**  Yes and no. So yes, they've continued. So certainly within fresh and chilled food and  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:11):**  produce, if anything, there is more of that food available. I think the area that everybody's  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:18):**  focused on at the moment is ambient food, tins and packets. It's due to the stockpiling  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:23):**  and the unforeseen rush of demand and the kind of just in time forecasting that everybody  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:29):**  has adopted over the past five years or so. That's created a shortage of ambient. However,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:36):**  to compensate for that, there is far more fresh and chilled food available because nobody  
**[0:29:42-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:42):**  knows what the new normal is. So how on earth do you forecast for it? All of us were eating  
**[0:29:47-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:47):**  35% of our weekly calories out within takeaways or restaurants or cafes. Now we have to acquire  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:56):**  all of that food or the majority of that food to actually eat within the household. So the  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:00):**  supermarkets just don't know what the new normal looks like anymore.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:04):**  And of course, people are being discouraged from going to their retailers any more than  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:07):**  is strictly necessary. And so perhaps stocking up on those things that will survive in the  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:13):**  store cupboard, but you can only buy so many lettuce before you expect them to go off.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:18):**  So perhaps that's contributed to stores having rather more of the fruit and veg left available  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:25):**  for you to use at the end of the day.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:27):**  Yeah, exactly. And there is a number of issues along with that as well. So we don't tend  
**[0:30:33-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:33):**  to get our food directly from the supermarket itself. It tends to be the supply chain or  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:37):**  the factories and industry that supply the supermarket. But I can tell you at a supermarket  
**[0:30:42-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:42):**  level, they are seeing a lot of charities that no longer can come along and collect  
**[0:30:49-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:49):**  that food. So there's been a 40% change in the landscape of charities and there were  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:56):**  shortages over the last two or three weeks. But all of the shortages have now normalised,  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:02):**  but the charities haven't quite re-engineered or come back to the surface. So now there  
**[0:31:09-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:09):**  is a problem with quite a bit of food available to redistribute at store level and not enough  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:15):**  charities yet to satisfy that demand.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:19):**  And how are you able to help with that? Have you been sort of stepping in and growing your  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:25):**  own output as a result?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:26):**  Yeah, well, we absolutely are. So as part of our addressing of Covid, we have started  
**[0:31:33-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:33):**  to team up with the local government and local authorities around Greater Manchester to start  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:40):**  home delivery services. So there's a lot of furloughed teams out there from leisure centres  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:45):**  or offices, etc, that are fit and well and sat at home that are looking to volunteer.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:52):**  And these guys are coming along and delivering on behalf of, for example, Manchester City  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:57):**  Council food to people that are shielded or are in crisis. So what we're doing now is  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:03):**  rather than increasing the number of hubs that we work with, we're increasing the number  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:08):**  of home delivery services by improving the packing operation that we have within the  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:13):**  warehouse. So at the moment, we're growing almost 50% week on week.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:18):**  Do you have a sense of, in terms of volume or scale, where you were a month ago, where  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:23):**  you are now and where you expect to be?  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:26):**  Sure. So the first two are relatively straightforward. So we were dealing with around 1200 families  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:31):**  pre-Covid. Last week, we did, I think it was 1700 families that we fed. However, where  
**[0:32:39-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:39):**  we want to get to is significantly higher than that. So we, this weekend, are quite  
**[0:32:45-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:45):**  literally moving from a 5000 square foot warehouse to a new 35,000 square foot premises so that  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:54):**  we can hugely increase our capacity to take more inbound food and to create more packing  
**[0:33:00-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:00):**  opportunities because we have so many more opportunities with food and so many more volunteers,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:06):**  we can increase our capacity to meet the demand that all the local government agencies are  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:11):**  facing to create more food parcels for people at home.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:16):**  And have you found that your customers have changed, the demography of your customers  
**[0:33:20-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:20):**  has changed?  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:21):**  Yeah. So we would describe our demographic as the working poor. So they tended to be  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:28):**  not quite in crisis, but almost on the cusp of it. So it didn't take much to actually  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:33):**  tip them over the edge. A broken boiler, a broken washing machine could do it. And that  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:38):**  would start a cycle where they would need a doorstep lender to get out of that crisis.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:43):**  But then the doorstep lender and their interest rates mean that they can no longer afford  
**[0:33:48-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:48):**  and the cycle starts. So we've managed to be able to create savings for our members  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:55):**  then. I think it's possibly too early to tell right now about the demographic of our  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:01):**  current members, but it looks like more of the same because I think one of the interesting  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:07):**  points that not enough people are talking about yet is that yet again, it tends to be  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:14):**  the worse off that suffer the most because of the conditions they have to live in, their  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:21):**  lack of access to general information and be that because they're technically isolated  
**[0:34:27-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:27):**  or they're living in a really small flat and they're living on top of each other. So there  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:34):**  is a statistic to look at which hasn't really been addressed yet around just how affected  
**[0:34:41-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:41):**  the worse off tend to be in such pandemics because it does tend to be that they don't  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:47):**  have the same resilience or the abilities to cope purely and simply because of the circumstances  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:52):**  that are not the fault.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:53):**  It's a remarkable illustration that you use that, you know, somebody's boiler breaks and  
**[0:34:57-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:57):**  that tips them from a situation where they're coping just about day to day and then suddenly  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:04):**  that extra bit of expenditure that's needed tips them over the edge and just means that  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:09):**  it's impossible to cope. I mean coronavirus coming through, stopping people from working,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:13):**  stopping people having to rely on savings that they simply don't have. I mean this is  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:17):**  just a wrecking ball to the kind of communities that you serve.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:21):**  Sad but true and we can only see what that looks like in the months to come.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:26):**  Do you think that there are positives that could come out of this in terms of trying  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:31):**  to design or persuade policymakers to design better policies as we go forward?  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:37):**  Yeah I do see that and I don't think it's just the food system. I think that I don't  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:42):**  think any of us will go back to how we were. I think that there will be so many changes  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:48):**  and you can already feel the landscape changing in most sectors but from a supply chain perspective  
**[0:35:54-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:54):**  I think everybody can see that there needs to be some more resilience within that supply  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:59):**  chain. I think the way that the retailers are responding at the moment and reducing  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:04):**  the range that is available of certain products etc. I think that's a really good thing. I  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:09):**  think that will build in some resilience and I think that there will be more strategies  
**[0:36:15-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:15):**  like that yet to come. That may mean that we also become more citizens and think about  
**[0:36:22-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:22):**  civic duty more than being a casual consumer can shall we say because we are all thinking  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:29):**  about the food that we eat currently. We are all thinking about supplies and we are getting  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:34):**  a closer relationship back to where it should have been with food because we still waste  
**[0:36:40-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:40):**  an incredible amount of food domestically.

**[0:36:48-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:48):**  and stresses in our food system. Those working at the front line of food provision deserve  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:36:54):**  our support and admiration not only during this crisis but as we emerge and until governments  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:37:00):**  sufficiently prioritise the eradication of poverty and hunger in our societies. I'd

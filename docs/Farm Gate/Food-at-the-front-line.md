**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  Throughout any normal year, food aid providers such as food banks and food kitchens ensure  that nutritious food and meals are available for people and families in crisis and for  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:20):**  the working poor. These facilities are often run by staff but are usually supported by  a multitude of community volunteers.  Coronavirus has led to lockdown, the loss of work, jobs and income. It has forced people  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:33):**  with little or no savings to turn to strangers, to outside charities and institutions just  to be able to eat.  Food aid providers already working to capacity have had to swiftly adapt their service models  
**[0:00:46-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:00:46):**  to cope with the influx of new, fearful, hungry and potentially infected people.  In this programme, I'll speak to three people working to provide food at the frontline of  the social crisis caused by pandemic and by governmental attempts to contain the coronavirus.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:03):**  Later I'll speak to Greg Silverman, the Executive Director of the West Side Campaign  Against Hunger in New York City, and Mark Game, the Chief Executive of the Bread and  Butter Thing, a community-led charity in Greater Manchester, UK.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:16):**  But first I spoke to Dee Woods. Dee runs Granville Community Kitchen in Kilburn, London. She  is the Chair of the Independent Food Aid Network and she sits on the London Food Board. I asked  her how coronavirus has affected Granville Community Kitchen.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:33):**  One, the demand has literally doubled and as this crisis deepens we expect it to be  worse. We're doing a lot more deliveries. We've always had a percentage of deliveries  to people, especially older people and disabled people, but that has increased. We're also  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:01:57):**  seeing an increase of people who aren't within the local borough, so we're delivering  to Westminster and Camden and getting people from that borough as well, because there isn't  anything else in the area except us.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:13):**  Is it still the same sort of people that are coming to you or have you seen a great change  in the types of people that are coming to you?  I think we've seen a great change. We're seeing a lot more families and I think that's  
**[0:02:26-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:26):**  because they're not accessing the help through the free school meals. A lot of those families  are self-isolating and with the voucher scheme, it means they have to travel to particular  supermarkets which we don't have locally and the food being offered by the schools wasn't  
**[0:02:48-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:02:48):**  necessarily what they might eat. We're also in an area with a lot of people who are no  recourse for public funds, so that group is still coming, but we're seeing a lot more  people, a lot more families, a lot more people who are working and can't access any finances.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:09):**  They don't have any savings and they've literally run out of food.  And the people who are coming now, the newer people who are coming in, do you think that  these are largely people from the gig economy or are they people regularly in work in a  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:22):**  different way, but they just simply physically aren't able to work as a result of the pandemic  lockdown?  Yes, we're seeing a lot more people like that, definitely. What we have seen a reduction  
**[0:03:33-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:33):**  in are a lot of people who were destitute and homeless and that's because the GLA and  local authorities have been taking people off the street and putting them into temporary  accommodation. But what we found is that we're delivering to those places because they haven't  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:03:54):**  really sourced the supply of food yet, so we're delivering food parcels to temporary  parcels. So you've got two sort of parts of what you  do. One is providing meals for people who come to you and the other is catering for  
**[0:04:08-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:08):**  packaging meals and taking them to people who are self isolating. How do you ensure  that your staff and that the people who are coming to you and that you're delivering to  stay safe? We're following all the guidelines that have  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:24):**  come down. So we're wearing PPE stuff, we're maintaining a two metre distance. We pack  everything and we place it on a table so there's no contact. We have a high sanitisation routine,  which we have anyway because we're providing food, but just that we're extending it to  
**[0:04:46-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:04:46):**  other surfaces that we wouldn't normally do. So like door handles, other areas where we  wouldn't normally have to do that. With deliveries, people are wearing masks and gloves and aprons.  They don't enter anyone's homes. They put the food on the doorstep and let people know  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:09):**  that food has arrived and they step back two metres.  And obviously you're on the front line of providing this really very basic fundamental  service to people at this time of crisis. Do you feel confident that you're safe in  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:26):**  these activities? I think we're safe for now. My concern is  as food supplies dry up and as it is, we're struggling to access food supplies, whether  it's surplus or whether we're buying it because we are having to buy food as well, that people  
**[0:05:45-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:05:45):**  will start becoming violent. And I have heard from other food aid providers within the IFAN  network that people are becoming unruly. So physical violence is a concern.  And why is that? Why are people becoming more violent? Is it because you're not able to  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:08):**  provide the food that they're expecting or is there something else going on?  I think it's just desperation. When people are hungry and we deal with a lot of people  who call up and say, I haven't eaten for several days. So it is a matter of fear and insecurity  
**[0:06:27-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:27):**  that people will become violent. Now you said that your food supplies in themselves  are vulnerable. Where do you normally get food from and how has that changed as a result  of the pandemic? So with Granville Community Kitchen, we've  
**[0:06:43-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:06:43):**  had a mixture of sources. So we work directly with some farmers and sort of local growers  to access food, as well as some that we've grown ourselves and some we buy and some from  the food surplus. So I think we're a bit more resilient than a lot of other projects, but  
**[0:07:05-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:05):**  it is a struggle right now to actually get enough food to feed 200 people. Because we  supply food on a weekly basis, we pack parcels that will support people weekly. Getting that  volume of food several times a week is difficult. So people, if they're coming to you and they're  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:30):**  expecting to get food parcels to take away, then that's food that will last them across  that week to come. Yes. And we have to bear in mind that for  a lot of people, food insecurity also means that they don't have refrigeration or they  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:07:46):**  don't have the means to cook. So because they're not hostile or, you know, their landlords  won't let them have anything beyond a microwave. So we have to have a mixture of food that  we can give to people. And if people don't have refrigeration of  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:04):**  their own or don't have cooking facilities, is there some community equivalent that they're  able to use at all? Or is it simply that they just need to keep a carrier bag of food in  their rooms and fend for themselves a bit? A combination. So we've managed to get, you  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:22):**  know, more refrigeration equipment and we will store, you know, some stuff for people.  We used to be able to have people come in and prepare food, which they would then take  back, but we can't do that anymore. So it is a dire situation. And when you add in the  
**[0:08:43-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:08:43):**  medically vulnerable, you know, to, to that mix, it literally is a recipe for disaster.  And are there still people that, that you're aware of, that you see in the community that  are somehow falling through the gaps, not only in terms of your own provision, but council  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:01):**  provision and other, other food kitchen provision? I think there'll always be people falling  through the gaps. And it tends to be people who are no recourse to public funds. People  who would not trust the authorities and would be totally dependent on unrestricted projects  
**[0:09:21-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:21):**  like mine. And some of those people have disappeared. You know, they have gone to ground because  they fear being detained. When you talk about people with no recourse  to public funds, who do you mean? Refugees and other migrants who most often  
**[0:09:39-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:39):**  don't have the right to work and don't have the right to access any benefits. If, you  know, migrants and refugees were able to work, that would lift them out of poverty and then  they would not have to come to food banks and depend on charity for all essentials for  
**[0:09:59-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:09:59):**  their life. And do people have to pay for the services  that you're providing or is it entirely free? It is entirely free.  Now, when you talk about people potentially becoming more violent as food scarcity means  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:14):**  that you're unable to provide the services at the volume that's required by people. What  are your concerns there? How do you keep the people that are working with you safe?  I mean, I've literally done a risk assessment. So we're set up in a way that if, you know,  
**[0:10:31-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:31):**  people do become violent, that we're able to shut ourselves in. We only allow one person  at a time to come to the point of collection and building we're in. It is pretty safe.  So we are able to lock ourselves in if need be.  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:10:51):**  So you're sort of building in those defences on the assumption that this level of violence  may escalate in the future, which is really very worrying.  Yeah. And I know there's some people who've asked, well, can we have the army or police  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:07):**  presence? But I don't think we're quite there yet.  In the normal, you know, in the normal course of affairs, would you anticipate having problems  and violence towards your staff and volunteers? Or is this something that you're fearing specifically  
**[0:11:24-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:24):**  as a result of the coronavirus pandemic? I mean, we have had people who have been quite,  you know, violent or abusive. And we're fortunate that, you know, there's someone in centre  who we can call on and with a security specialist. So he's been really great at sort of defusing  
**[0:11:46-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:11:46):**  situations. I think, you know, if it is a group of people, we aren't prepared really  to deal with that other than having to lock ourselves in and call the police. Yeah.  Now Dee, you've worked in and around the inner city for a long time. And I wonder if you  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:06):**  were talking to a politician now and you were saying that you had the power to reform the  food system and make access fairer for everybody, what would be your number one top priority?  It would be putting cash in the hands of people. All right. Which means national living wage  
**[0:12:25-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:25):**  should go up or we have some sort of universal income benefits as well need to be upgraded.  So child benefit is an easy one. Universal credit that needs upgraded and to remove that  five week wait. I mean, all those measures in terms of reducing poverty need to come  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:12:46):**  in. And then in terms of food access, right, there are literally areas in the city, in  the country that doesn't have access to good food. So we need to have markets and other  ways of people being able to access good food. And what do you think the government thinks  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:06):**  of organisations like your own? Do you think that food banks and food kitchens are built  into government policy, that they just expect you to pick up the pieces? Or do you think  that there is a real level of impetus within government to try to solve the kinds of problems  
**[0:13:23-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:23):**  that you've been outlining? I think they expect us to pick up in pieces  and especially now, you know, they think, well, OK, we exist so we could handle all  the food things and the government will handle sort of the identified medically vulnerable.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:13:43):**  And I don't think we should be existing in policy. We shouldn't have to exist. What we  need in policy is a right to food legislation that would ensure that people are able to  access adequate food, healthy food and culturally appropriate food.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:02):**  Dee Woods from Granville Community Kitchen. Chef Greg Silverman is the executive director  of the West Side Campaign Against Hunger, which aims to provide access with dignity  to a choice of healthy food and supportive services in New York City. I asked him to  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:18):**  describe how the West Side Campaign Against Hunger operates.  The West Side Campaign Against Hunger, better known as WISCA, created the choice model pantry  over two and a half decades ago. So the best practice model of how you deliver food with  
**[0:14:32-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:32):**  dignity to hungry people, in a sense creating a grocery store that's free, is the model  we created. And we give out almost 50% fresh produce and on top of that fresh milk and  fresh, fresh meats and frozen meats, canned goods and dried goods are part of it. But  
**[0:14:46-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:46):**  those are just staples, right? But that's not the only thing people need. And at the  same time, we have an entire team of social service workers who make sure that beyond  food, food is sort of the first step that people take when they need help. They come  
**[0:14:58-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:14:58):**  to us and they want food. But we try to find out what are all the public sector benefits,  city, state, federal level that we can help people gain access to. And that's where actually  the real strength of our work lies. We give away 1.7 million pounds of food a year.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:12):**  And who is it that you're catering for on a normal day to day basis, coronavirus apart?  What sort of people are they that are that are coming and using the service that you  provide?  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:22):**  Over 60% of our customers are Latinx community members. So we have lots of recent immigrants  who come to us or we have about 28% seniors. So lots of hungry New Yorkers who have been  here and paid their dues and worked their years and years and they just still can't  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:38):**  make ends meet. Lots of families with kids. And right, like if you sort of look at the  28% seniors and you look at the families with kids, the number of people who are the working  poor, who are of working age is a minority number. But those people are all usually we  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:15:54):**  find working. They're working whether it's part time jobs, they're working off the books  because they have different immigration status issues.  Our customers are also going to grocery stores, right? Like the West Side Campaigning as Hunger  
**[0:16:07-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:07):**  and the emergency feeding system in general isn't meant to be the sole source of food  for someone. It sort of helps the top up throughout the month. So whatever someone's benefits  are, whatever work they, money they have, in a sense, we help to stretch their food  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:20):**  dollars further. So we know people are still going to grocery stores, they're going to  soup kitchens, they're going to other locations to get food, but they're doing everything  they can to like it's the hardest job in New York City, right? To be poor is the hardest  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:32):**  job that exists. You travel around your city trying to pull things together to make sure  you can feed your family through not one single mechanism. Like we don't have some strong  safety net. You know, thinking that there's over 700 food pantries in New York City alone.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:16:46):**  I mean, that's this ragtag and true system of feeding. And by the way, over 30% of those  pantries have closed in the last month because of the coronavirus. So if you think about  that, that tells you how weak and frayed the social safety net is in America, let alone  
**[0:17:01-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:01):**  New York City.  You've taken us into the next question, which is how has coronavirus changed the provision  that's being demanded of you?  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:09):**  I think we're just starting to scale up. I think, you know, the big issue for most  pantries and frontline organisations is more operational at first. So, for example, by  giving out 50% fresh produce, when that produce comes in by the palette, you know, we go through  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:24):**  it, make sure it's all good, separate it, throw out everything that's bad, bag it up  so it's ready to go for customers. That is taken care of by 1700 volunteers a year. You  know, a month ago, that entire volunteer base was gone. Corporate volunteers ended, school  
**[0:17:38-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:38):**  volunteer groups ended, religious institution volunteer groups ended. And then it was decided  for safety reasons, we need to just stop having volunteers altogether. We're just bringing  them back. So we had to move to a lot more shelf-stable product that was ready to go.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:17:49):**  And so that, you know, we started spending another $10,000 a week on food alone that  we're buying, not getting donated. Had to bring in more contracts, some more contract  staff to help support this work. So those piece, getting pallet jacks and carts and  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:04):**  things that cost money and the safety precautions for our team, making sure, you know, folks  have masks, that we have tents for when we're outside because of the, like today's rain,  that we also know we have staff who have already had staff who have contracted the virus and  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:17):**  who are home for 14 days and some whose spouses have contracted the virus and therefore are  home caring for them. So we've had decreased staff capacity, decreased volunteer capacity,  increased need and having to shift the model. I wouldn't say that scale is the first thing  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:31):**  that's happening, but it's staying afloat and being able to do the good work and not  stop so that our customers have been depending on us for years can continue to depend on  us. And that's not even talking about the coming crush of unemployed people in the service  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:45):**  industry as they go from, you know, even if they got two weeks severance to next step,  they're going to apply for unemployment, which they have to wait and then for food stamps  and they have to wait about a month to do that. So it's going to take a while for that  
**[0:18:58-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:18:58):**  crush to hit us and hopefully we'll be ready to scale up. The community has got our back,  right? And we are finding amazing support happening right now. Luckily we have more  funding coming in in a very strong way right now, but we know if history repeats itself,  
**[0:19:13-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:13):**  whether it's from hurricane Sandy or in 2008 or 9-11, like these instances funding comes  in for a series of, for many weeks and then it drops off. And the question will be, you  know, two months from now, when we go back to our key supporters for our normal money  
**[0:19:29-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:29):**  funds for the year ahead, are they still with us?  Paul  How has the way that you actually give food to people changed as a result of coronavirus?  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:37):**  David  Yeah, we created the choice model globally and now we're back to giving pre-bagged kits  of food. There is not a choice for customers right now. We're creating one model and we  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:19:48):**  give out that for each person gets the same. They get a bag filled with produce, fresh  with vegetables that's fresh and canned. They get a bag of fruit that's fresh and a couple  of canned. They get a bag of whole grains. That's usually some fresh bread, some pop,  
**[0:20:04-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:04):**  a different type of whole grain pasta, a rice, a cereal. There's a bag of proteins. That's  anything from, you know, dried beans, canned beans, canned fish, canned meat. We're still  figuring out how to re-bring back our frozen meats just because it's a question of more  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:19):**  of refrigeration capacity right now. And then the milk right now is shelf-stable milk or  shelf-stable alternative dairy.  Paul  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:26):**  And in every community around the world, there are always people that fall through the gaps.  How successful are you at the moment in picking up those people who might otherwise be falling  through the gaps?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:35):**  David  I mean, that's our entire business model, right, for the last 40 years is there's no  real safety net for hungry New Yorkers. And so we fill in the gaps, right, like in a perfect  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:45):**  world. And this is in a perfect world, which truthfully is a perfect storm before coronavirus  even of those people who no matter what are still not going to have enough to eat for  themselves and their family. And so we step in to make sure that we can get them extra  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:20:59):**  food. And I think in coronavirus, that's just it's accentuating every crack in the system.  We can compare different countries at some level and say like, wait, what's happening  when you lose your job in the US, you lose your job, right? What kind of benefits are  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:14):**  you really going to be to get right away? And it's not the same as you have in other  countries, right? We're desperately and sadly behind in many ways when it comes to a safety  net for our customers. Like having worked, I worked for the City of London for a number  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:28):**  of years in the UK. And so I know what people in the UK can complain about the decreasing  safety net in the UK, but these are two separate worlds of sad safety nets. You know, people  are on their own here. And so how we get them access is to fill in a sense, get them some  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:21:47):**  food and help them navigate an incredibly bureaucratic social safety net that doesn't  give that much, but it's really difficult to get access to it. So our team is really  great. Our experts at helping people navigate the system so they can get the sports they  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:03):**  need. Are there lessons that you think New Yorkans or people across America around the  world should really be picking up on and learning as a result of things they're discovering  throughout the pandemic period? I'm a chef who talks a lot about when people are hangry,  
**[0:22:20-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:20):**  right? And how they make bad food choices when they're hangry and how they act out when  they're hangry. The truth of the matter is most people with means have never truly been  hangry and they've never been food insecure and they still get angry. And in the instance  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:32):**  like coronavirus, all these people are going back to eating the worst foods possible because  they're stressed out. Well, we got 40 plus million people in America who are on food  stamps who have been stressed out getting meals well before COVID hit. And it might  
**[0:22:48-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:22:48):**  be a wake up call to those with means and those in power to understand like how difficult  it is to be in poverty and therefore like what needs to be put in place to help lift  people out of it. Because I don't think we really truly understand how difficult it is.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:02):**  You know, people are complaining now about they're going to run out of toilet paper,  but they're still able to purchase toilet paper. They'll pay any amount for it, but  they have the means. And it's just, it's a chance for people to understand a little bit  
**[0:23:13-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:13):**  what it feels like to not have what you need and to be stressed every day. You use the  term hangry. I'm guessing that's hungry and angry. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And so that's, that's kind of saying, well, if, if people are hungry, if people are living  
**[0:23:28-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:28):**  in poverty, then there are just so many extra emotions and, and mental health challenges,  which are layered on top of that, which make life difficult just in the day to day, but  climbing out of that living trough that people have, have found themselves in, it becomes  
**[0:23:45-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:45):**  even more difficult. Totally. And I think we, we, you know, we see this every day. Our  customers are stressed when they come in to visit and we, that's why we make sure we have  a, you know, we put out food, we put out coffee, we put out bagels, we put out different foods,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:23:58):**  food because you know, they're hungry and they need help. But I also think just, it's,  it's a chance to like, we're seeing that we're able to sort of test out, innovate on new  ideas and it's not about doing things alone, right? It's about partnership and collaboration.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:11):**  And I think we, we have to use this as an opportunity to create a new landscape for,  for how we, we feed hungry people, right? And how we feed our community and the community  is everyone. And we've been doing it, like when I said like 700 food pantries exists  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:25):**  in New York City, like, I don't know what that means. Like, why do we have 700 ad hoc,  not part of a formal system method for feeding people that like, this seems like there's  a real problem. Obviously we've been at it for 40 years in emergency feeding. Emergencies  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:41):**  don't last 40 years. That's not, that's not the definition of an emergency. That's a  definition of a failed system.  Greg Silverman from the West Side campaign against hunger. Mark Game is chief executive  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:24:53):**  of the Bread and Butter thing, which takes surplus food given by industry and redistributes  it through community hubs throughout Greater Manchester. I started by asking him just how  do these food surpluses occur?  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:06):**  I suppose the easiest way of trying to think about this is if you ever try to have a dinner  party or just even make a meal for people, you've always got to think about just how  much food you're going to make to make sure everybody's satisfied. And some people will  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:21):**  want seconds and some people won't want the volume of food that you've made. The retailers  in the supermarkets have the same problems every day, but they're trying to feed over  60 million people in the UK every day. And that's a real challenge. So although they  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:35):**  are very sophisticated and they have a lot of forecasting intelligence, et cetera, around  this nowadays, there's still one or 2% of fluctuation. A really easy example is if the  long range forecast is telling us all, I should say pre-COVID, that there's going to be a  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:25:56):**  nice sunny weekend ahead and we'd all start planning barbecues, then the retailers would  all start ordering the beef burgers and the sausages, et cetera. But then if there's a  freak storm and it rains and nobody buys the food or that food becomes surplus, it's still  
**[0:26:09-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:09):**  on the shelves, nobody's taking it.  And so pre-COVID, how would that food be presented to your members or the users?  We use a model that's very much like a veg box scheme. So a veg box scheme would look  
**[0:26:23-0:26:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:23):**  at what is seasonal and regional and is available at the time. And they would push that selection  onto the end user. We do the same, but with surpluses. So what we always try and do is  do three bags of food, one of covered goods, cereals, packets, one of fridge goods, such  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:39):**  as dairy or protein or ready meals, and one of fruit and veg. What we don't guarantee  anybody is that we will be able to always provide them with exactly what they want.  If people are picky and need to be, need more choice in their life, then our model's not  
**[0:26:56-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:26:56):**  for them. But if you can have some elasticity of thought around what you could do with food  that is presented to you, that is simply surplus, and that can look like potatoes, sweet potatoes,  cauliflowers and oranges one week and the following week it could be onions, carrots  
**[0:27:11-0:27:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:11):**  and oranges.  And are people paying for the service that you provide in the same way that you buy a  veg box? It's just that it's cheaper.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:19):**  Absolutely. So people pay for our service, generally speaking, it's £7.50 for three  bags of food that a retail value would be around £40.  And so that helps to fund the services that you're providing, I imagine it's part of your  
**[0:27:34-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:34):**  business model.  Exactly. It covers our running costs.  And what's the scope of the Bread and Butter project? Because it's not just one outlet,  
**[0:27:42-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:42):**  is it?  So we currently have 28 hubs in Greater Manchester and we have two running in Darlington as well  in the Tees Valley now. I guess the scope is that this is very much a supply driven  
**[0:27:54-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:27:54):**  model. So the more food that we can unlock from the food industry and redistribute, the  larger we can grow.  How has coronavirus and the pandemic changed things?  
**[0:28:08-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:08):**  The Bread and Butter thing before Covid was very much a community led organisation. So  we would take the food in our vans and we would encourage community volunteers to come  and help us in their community projects across Greater Manchester to come and pack the food  
**[0:28:26-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:26):**  with us. Sadly, post Covid, what we've had to do is retrench. We have to recognise that  some of our volunteers and people in the community were vulnerable. So we have to now pack all  of those bags in the warehouse. So we're much more of a crisis food delivery service than  
**[0:28:47-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:28:47):**  a community led service now.  Obviously there's been a really substantial change in the way that supermarkets have been  ordering their own food for their own retail and the way that people have been buying that  
**[0:29:00-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:00):**  food. Have those surpluses changed as a result of the pandemic?  Yes and no. So yes, they've continued. So certainly within fresh and chilled food and  produce, if anything, there is more of that food available. I think the area that everybody's  
**[0:29:18-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:18):**  focused on at the moment is ambient food, tins and packets. It's due to the stockpiling  and the unforeseen rush of demand and the kind of just in time forecasting that everybody  has adopted over the past five years or so. That's created a shortage of ambient. However,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:36):**  to compensate for that, there is far more fresh and chilled food available because nobody  knows what the new normal is. So how on earth do you forecast for it? All of us were eating  35% of our weekly calories out within takeaways or restaurants or cafes. Now we have to acquire  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:29:56):**  all of that food or the majority of that food to actually eat within the household. So the  supermarkets just don't know what the new normal looks like anymore.  And of course, people are being discouraged from going to their retailers any more than  
**[0:30:07-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:07):**  is strictly necessary. And so perhaps stocking up on those things that will survive in the  store cupboard, but you can only buy so many lettuce before you expect them to go off.  So perhaps that's contributed to stores having rather more of the fruit and veg left available  
**[0:30:25-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:25):**  for you to use at the end of the day.  Yeah, exactly. And there is a number of issues along with that as well. So we don't tend  to get our food directly from the supermarket itself. It tends to be the supply chain or  
**[0:30:37-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:37):**  the factories and industry that supply the supermarket. But I can tell you at a supermarket  level, they are seeing a lot of charities that no longer can come along and collect  that food. So there's been a 40% change in the landscape of charities and there were  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:30:56):**  shortages over the last two or three weeks. But all of the shortages have now normalised,  but the charities haven't quite re-engineered or come back to the surface. So now there  is a problem with quite a bit of food available to redistribute at store level and not enough  
**[0:31:15-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:15):**  charities yet to satisfy that demand.  And how are you able to help with that? Have you been sort of stepping in and growing your  own output as a result?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:26):**  Yeah, well, we absolutely are. So as part of our addressing of Covid, we have started  to team up with the local government and local authorities around Greater Manchester to start  home delivery services. So there's a lot of furloughed teams out there from leisure centres  
**[0:31:45-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:31:45):**  or offices, etc, that are fit and well and sat at home that are looking to volunteer.  And these guys are coming along and delivering on behalf of, for example, Manchester City  Council food to people that are shielded or are in crisis. So what we're doing now is  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:03):**  rather than increasing the number of hubs that we work with, we're increasing the number  of home delivery services by improving the packing operation that we have within the  warehouse. So at the moment, we're growing almost 50% week on week.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:18):**  Do you have a sense of, in terms of volume or scale, where you were a month ago, where  you are now and where you expect to be?  Sure. So the first two are relatively straightforward. So we were dealing with around 1200 families  
**[0:32:31-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:31):**  pre-Covid. Last week, we did, I think it was 1700 families that we fed. However, where  we want to get to is significantly higher than that. So we, this weekend, are quite  literally moving from a 5000 square foot warehouse to a new 35,000 square foot premises so that  
**[0:32:54-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:32:54):**  we can hugely increase our capacity to take more inbound food and to create more packing  opportunities because we have so many more opportunities with food and so many more volunteers,  we can increase our capacity to meet the demand that all the local government agencies are  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:11):**  facing to create more food parcels for people at home.  And have you found that your customers have changed, the demography of your customers  has changed?  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:21):**  Yeah. So we would describe our demographic as the working poor. So they tended to be  not quite in crisis, but almost on the cusp of it. So it didn't take much to actually  tip them over the edge. A broken boiler, a broken washing machine could do it. And that  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:38):**  would start a cycle where they would need a doorstep lender to get out of that crisis.  But then the doorstep lender and their interest rates mean that they can no longer afford  and the cycle starts. So we've managed to be able to create savings for our members  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:33:55):**  then. I think it's possibly too early to tell right now about the demographic of our  current members, but it looks like more of the same because I think one of the interesting  points that not enough people are talking about yet is that yet again, it tends to be  
**[0:34:14-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:14):**  the worse off that suffer the most because of the conditions they have to live in, their  lack of access to general information and be that because they're technically isolated  or they're living in a really small flat and they're living on top of each other. So there  
**[0:34:34-0:34:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:34):**  is a statistic to look at which hasn't really been addressed yet around just how affected  the worse off tend to be in such pandemics because it does tend to be that they don't  have the same resilience or the abilities to cope purely and simply because of the circumstances  
**[0:34:52-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:34:52):**  that are not the fault.  It's a remarkable illustration that you use that, you know, somebody's boiler breaks and  that tips them from a situation where they're coping just about day to day and then suddenly  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:04):**  that extra bit of expenditure that's needed tips them over the edge and just means that  it's impossible to cope. I mean coronavirus coming through, stopping people from working,  stopping people having to rely on savings that they simply don't have. I mean this is  
**[0:35:17-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-at-the-front-line-eco46a#t=0:35:17):**  just a wrecking ball to the kind of communities that you serve.  Sad but true and we can only see what that looks like in the months to come.  Do you think that there are positives that could come out of this in terms of trying

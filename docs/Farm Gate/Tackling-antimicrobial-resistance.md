### Farm Gate  (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 15:02:05)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Kustain. It's World Antimicrobial Awareness Week, so  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:10):**  we're doing our bit. What is antimicrobial resistance? Why is it a problem? What are  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:16):**  the drivers and what can we do about it? I'm joined by Laura Hyam from Vet Sustain and  
**[0:00:21-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:21):**  by Oysen Thorsen, the Chief Executive of FAI Farms. Hello both, Laura, let's get cracking.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:28):**  What is antimicrobial resistance? So antimicrobial resistance, or AMR, is the ability of microbes  
**[0:00:34-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:34):**  so that they are microscopic organisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi to  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:41):**  grow and survive in the presence of an antimicrobial agent. So in essence, this means that microbes  
**[0:00:47-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:47):**  can change to render antimicrobials ineffective. So this is like the sort of process of evolution  
**[0:00:54-0:00:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:54):**  at micro level. That's right, because, and we're talking specifically here mainly about  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:00:59):**  bacteria, because antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing public health threats  
**[0:01:04-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:04):**  of our time. So there's a real focus on antibiotic resistance and often antibiotic resistance  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:09):**  is used interchangeably with the term antimicrobial resistance. But yeah, indeed, bacteria can  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:15):**  multiply so rapidly that if they obtain a mutation, either just through random mutation  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:20):**  or by acquiring genes from another bacteria, they can then get an evolutionary advantage  
**[0:01:26-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:26):**  over their counterparts and can grow and multiply and form a new colony of superbugs, essentially.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:33):**  So what you're saying is that these bacteria are evolving at such a rapid rate that the  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:37):**  antibiotics that we've discovered, the bacteria are evolving so that they can fight these  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:42):**  things off faster than we're able to develop them. That's right. And even at the time when  
**[0:01:48-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:48):**  antibiotics were first discovered in the 1920s by Alexander Fleming, scientists then were  
**[0:01:53-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:53):**  saying that actually resistance is an inevitable outcome of this new discovery and the application  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:01:59):**  of antibiotics, because bacteria will always evolve and generate these evolutionary advantages  
**[0:02:04-0:02:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:04):**  to fend off whatever environmental challenge they come across. So it's always going to  
**[0:02:09-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:09):**  happen. And so it's no surprise now that we've got what is an escalating public health threat  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:14):**  that we now need to really take charge of and develop strategies to try and tackle.  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:21):**  And why is it such an important thing? Why is it a problem?  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:24):**  Yeah, so it means that we're starting to erode our antibiotic arsenal. So we've got multiple  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:29):**  classes of bacteria now at our disposal for modern medicine. And in fact, antibiotics  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:36):**  really define and underpin modern medicine and surgical procedures. So now, these surgical  
**[0:02:42-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:42):**  procedures and medical advancements, they're very commonplace to you and I, and they're  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:48):**  really underpinned by this suite of antibiotic agents that we that we now use, and we have  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:53):**  at our disposal. But obviously, if we start to reduce the number of antibiotics that are  
**[0:02:57-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:02:57):**  effective, we start to see major health challenges. And at the moment, antimicrobial resistance  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:03):**  causes 700,000 deaths per year. And that's estimated to escalate to 10 million by 2050.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:10):**  So we're talking about some serious health problems here, and that result from treatment  
**[0:03:15-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:15):**  failures, other adverse health outcomes, prolonged hospital stays, and obviously, ultimately  
**[0:03:20-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:20):**  death as well. We're looking really at comparing Victorian age type medicine with modern medicine,  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:26):**  we've got a booming human population, and we've got some incredible medical tools at  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:31):**  our disposal. In the animal world, and we've got a slightly different picture, I suppose,  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:36):**  and at the moment, antibiotics are incredibly important for animal health and welfare, but  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:42):**  also for food production and food safety. So we actually use antibiotics in the animal  
**[0:03:48-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:48):**  world, both for animal health and welfare, but also for these other production gains,  
**[0:03:53-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:53):**  which we obviously see in food animal production.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:03:56):**  Could you talk to us a little bit about what are the causes of this antimicrobial resistance?  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:00):**  Antimicrobial usage absolutely is the leading driver of antimicrobial resistance. So that  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:06):**  usage in people, animals, and in fact, in horticulture as well, is considered to be  
**[0:04:11-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:11):**  the leading driver across many institutions and researchers across the world. In horticulture,  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:16):**  which is an interesting one, antibiotics have also been used since the 50s to control certain  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:20):**  bacterial diseases in high value fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:25):**  In fruits and vegetables?  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:26):**  That's right. So streptomycin and tetracyclines and other types of antibiotics are used on  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:31):**  sprays in particularly high value food plants, for example, to tackle the likes of fire blight  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:37):**  in pear and apple and bacterial spot in peaches, but also in citrus as well. So yeah, there  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:42):**  is, there is usage, but it's relatively small, but usage generally is the biggest driver,  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:47):**  but there are other critical drivers that are emerging in the research. For example,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:53):**  concurrent disease and invasive procedures in people have been linked to the emergence  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:04:57):**  of antimicrobial resistance as an additional sort of factor. And also in animals, some  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:02):**  production practices and diets have been linked to antimicrobial resistance emergence. So  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:08):**  there are clearly multiple factors at play here that may involve stress and immune compromise,  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:13):**  or even microbiome sort of factors in the animal's guts as well. So this is of real  
**[0:05:18-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:18):**  interest that we look at holistic solutions that bring in all of these risk factors.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:22):**  Jason, I wonder if I can bring you in here. I wonder if you could talk to us about, you  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:27):**  know, why it is that antibiotics are used on farms and in particular, I guess why they're  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:31):**  overused and where the problems lie. Because my understanding is that a lot of the time  
**[0:05:35-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:35):**  that this data isn't being collected. We don't know how much antibiotic is being used on  
**[0:05:41-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:41):**  farms and that's part of the problem.  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:42):**  It is part of the problem. As Laura says, animal agriculture is the largest consumer  
**[0:05:47-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:47):**  of antibiotics globally. It's used for a number of reasons. It can be a growth promotion,  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:53):**  prevention of disease, and obviously it's also treatment of disease. There's also a  
**[0:05:58-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:05:58):**  number of different types of antibiotics used for those different types of purposes.  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:05):**  You mentioned treatment of disease there. Surely that's a good thing. If animals are  
**[0:06:08-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:08):**  sick, we need to treat them.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:10):**  Absolutely. And that's part of the sort of antibiotic stewardship and responsible use  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:15):**  of antibiotics that we promote absolutely includes looking after the animals and treating  
**[0:06:20-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:20):**  the animals that need it. But in fact, sort of keeping antibiotics for that particular  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:25):**  purpose and moving away from the use, sort of preventative use of antibiotics. So using  
**[0:06:32-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:32):**  it as a kind of production support, you know, something that you do every day to either  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:38):**  encourage growth or just hope the unforeseen problems don't appear. So we're sort of trying  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:44):**  to get companies to think about this as, you know, be more targeted, know more about how,  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:50):**  what kind of use is happening in your supply chain, for what reason, and then use that  
**[0:06:55-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:55):**  insight to then drive more responsible use of antibiotics.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:06:59):**  Just help me out. When we're talking about routine use of antibiotics, I mean, you mentioned  
**[0:07:04-0:07:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:04):**  growth promoting there. What other reasons are there? Because this stuff isn't cheap.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:08):**  Why are farmers sort of using this on a routine basis rather than saving it to use when an  
**[0:07:13-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:13):**  animal is actually sick and needs that boost?  
**[0:07:15-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:15):**  Yeah, I think, I think it's worth going back a little bit and looking through the history  
**[0:07:18-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:18):**  of animal agriculture very briefly. And in order to answer this question, so since the  
**[0:07:22-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:22):**  forties, we've seen a trend towards more intensive, specialised and mechanised systems of food  
**[0:07:28-0:07:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:28):**  animal production. And so since 1945, for example, Great Britain has seen a 65% decline  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:34):**  in the number of farms but a fourfold increase in yield. And in the USA, we've seen an increase  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:39):**  in concentrated feeding operations. And through these changes, we've succeeded in attaining  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:44):**  greater efficiency in food production, but also food security in some parts of the world  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:49):**  following the wars. But supporting this transition has been the introduction of antibiotics,  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:54):**  which has come up, which have come along at the same time. And soon after the advent of  
**[0:07:58-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:07:58):**  antibiotics and soon after they were made commercially available for people, they were  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:02):**  soon introduced into agriculture. And that was as early as the 1930s. And researchers  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:07):**  at the time trialled the use of mass medication in herds and flocks in feed, and they were  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:13):**  introduced in the forties. And then not long after that it was discovered that antibiotics  
**[0:08:17-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:17):**  actually accelerated growth in those herds and flocks. So soon after that, which was  
**[0:08:22-0:08:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:22):**  a bit of a watershed moment, antibiotics were rapidly used and spread across the globe to  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:27):**  control disease, promote growth, even to preserve food. And that's on farms in fishing and whaling  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:33):**  operations, processing plants and in aquaculture production as well. So you can see here we've  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:38):**  got this coevolution over time of both intensification of agriculture and the introduction and widespread  
**[0:08:44-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:44):**  use of antibiotics. And so now we've got this inextricable link between the two practices,  
**[0:08:49-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:49):**  which will now be very hard to unpick. And in fact, antibiotic usage is now considered  
**[0:08:53-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:53):**  by some to be a critical component of contemporary livestock production. And so now that we're  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:08:58):**  seeing calls to reduce and mitigate our usage, we've now got a big job of work to do to understand  
**[0:09:03-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:03):**  what systems and what approaches can support minimal antibiotic usage without compromising  
**[0:09:09-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:09):**  other sustainability outcomes such as animal health and welfare.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:12):**  Oistun, what do you think we need to do? What are the key things that we need to be doing  
**[0:09:16-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:16):**  at this point?  
**[0:09:17-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:17):**  We're seeing that both regulation and consumers are moving fairly fast in their understanding  
**[0:09:23-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:23):**  on antibiotics. And for FAI, this means that our focus is on the food industry and we want  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:30):**  to drive our clients and other companies in the food industry to move fast on this issue.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:36):**  So we want to race it. We think it's a critical issue. And for us, it starts with policy and  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:42):**  with measuring. Right. So, you know, the work that we do is helping companies first get  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:47):**  a handle on what is this crisis? What does it mean to them? What kind of threat does  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:52):**  it entail for them, for their investors, for their customers, for their suppliers, if you  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:09:58):**  like? And then really critically, how do they monitor the use? So we have a tool that we  
**[0:10:04-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:04):**  call antibiotics monitor that basically helps big companies with global supply chains and  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:11):**  poultry, for example, to really accurately, simply collect the right information. So collect  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:18):**  the information around what antibiotics are being used, for what reason? Where is it happening?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:24):**  Do we see differences between regions? What differences do we see between production systems?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:30):**  And then using that data to really drill down and understand why is this farmer or this  
**[0:10:35-0:10:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:35):**  supplier over here? Why do they have so much better results or lower use than this one  
**[0:10:42-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:42):**  over here?  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:43):**  Do you find that you are having to sort of bash down those doors at a global level with  
**[0:10:47-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:47):**  these food brands and say, look, come on, antibiotic resistance is something that's  
**[0:10:51-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:51):**  really important, you need to put it on your agenda? Or is it something that increasingly  
**[0:10:55-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:55):**  those food companies are coming to you and asking about and understanding that it's embedded  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:10:59):**  in that whole idea of sustainability?  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:02):**  I think it's a combination. So we have some companies that come to us, they understand  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:07):**  that this is a threat to society, to economies at large and their supply chain and customers.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:15):**  But then you also see, for example, through the last FAIR ranking, which ranked protein  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:21):**  producers across the world, according to a number of different kind of sustainability  
**[0:11:25-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:25):**  metrics, they found that 70% of protein producers were high risk for antibiotic stewardship,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:31):**  meaning that 70% of them had, you know, were not communicating any information about antibiotic  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:38):**  use in their supply chain. Many of them don't have a policy in place, they don't have an  
**[0:11:43-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:43):**  approach for this issue. So it's clear that while some do and some want help with this,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:50):**  we also see there's a massive need to push kind of off the shelf solutions to those companies  
**[0:11:56-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:11:56):**  who haven't yet realised what a big threat this is.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:00):**  And what kind of a threat is it? What, you know, in terms of global food businesses,  
**[0:12:05-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:05):**  what is the business risk of not taking this threat seriously?  
**[0:12:08-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:08):**  Again, the sort of investor network that looks at antimicrobial resistance as a threat to  
**[0:12:15-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:15):**  their portfolios, they came up with a figure that the cost of AMR in 2050 would be something  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:23):**  around a hundred trillion US dollar to the global economic system in terms of losses  
**[0:12:28-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:28):**  to the economic system. So that could be obviously through jeopardising food production, human  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:35):**  loss, longer sick leaves, longer hospital stays, you know, the sort of the myriad of  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:41):**  kind of knock on effects that you have when our core, our core mess and stop working.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:47):**  So it's an astronomical number. Then there's a more immediate one around companies wanting  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:53):**  to be responsible businesses, showing that they, you know, that they are on top of the  
**[0:12:58-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:12:58):**  challenges that could undermine their business. They're looking after their reputation and  
**[0:13:04-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:04):**  you see more and more NGOs and investors and media really raising this issue and looking  
**[0:13:10-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:10):**  to companies to see what are they doing and how are they, how are they tackling this risk?  
**[0:13:14-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:14):**  I guess that reputational thing, I'm kind of struck by that, that figure that you've  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:18):**  just used there, a hundred trillion dollars by 2050. And that isn't just within those  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:23):**  businesses themselves. This is, you know, being felt across the world economy, isn't  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:27):**  it? And it strikes me that there's an analogy here with, with climate change and with the  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:31):**  fossil fuel sector, that in the same way that the fossil fuel sector has driven human induced  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:36):**  anthropogenic climate change, which has a knock on cost for everybody around the world,  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:42):**  that the food companies are going to find that they, that the finger is pointed back  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:46):**  at them for this rise in antimicrobial resistance, which is costing everybody, costing everybody's  
**[0:13:51-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:51):**  economy so much money.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:53):**  Yeah, I think that's, that's why we are raising it on, on, on their agendas. We think that,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:13:58):**  you know, as, as customers of animal agriculture, they have a, have a responsibility. They have,  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:04):**  you know, relationships and means and opportunity to drive that behavior that we want to see  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:09):**  and drive that stewardship and responsibility. When it comes to this issue, we see food companies  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:15):**  as having a really critical role. This is an opportunity to be part of the solution.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:19):**  And that's what, that's what we're interested in. So we're interested in putting, putting  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:23):**  off the shelf solutions in front of companies that have an opportunity to make a real difference  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:28):**  in our mind that starts with education. So training, we offer training to people in the  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:34):**  food chain to understand this issue better, to understand what a good policy looks like,  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:39):**  to get a, get their heads around the different types of antibiotics that exist and how they  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:44):**  can drive better, better results. And then it's that next step of monitoring and collecting  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:51):**  very detailed information about how big this problem is for them.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:54):**  And do you think that there is any element, you know, in the same way that we saw with  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:14:58):**  climate change, is there any sort of form of denial from within these food companies?  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:02):**  Because if on one hand, as Laura was saying, we've got people within the food industry  
**[0:15:06-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:06):**  saying that antimicrobials, routine antibiotics are critical for livestock production, then  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:12):**  surely there must be some pushback to this idea that the whole food industry has to change  
**[0:15:17-0:15:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:17):**  the way that it's working with antibiotics.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:19):**  I'd just step in here, if you don't mind, I think just to address that point there,  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:22):**  that why have we got this kind of dichotomy between an urgent, very real and present danger  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:27):**  of AMR affecting human populations, and yet this consideration of antimicrobials as being  
**[0:15:32-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:32):**  critical to livestock production.  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:34):**  Ultimately, there is still and there's recently been, you know, contention around the concept  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:39):**  that antimicrobial usage in animals leads to antimicrobial resistance in people. There  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:45):**  are so many steps between that usage in an animal right through to clinical disease affecting  
**[0:15:50-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:50):**  a person. So with clinical consequences, there are so many steps. Every step has been documented  
**[0:15:56-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:15:56):**  by pretty robust research. But what has been the challenge from the research community  
**[0:16:01-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:01):**  has been stitching all of those steps together to one long chain with evidence to support  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:07):**  the whole the whole chain that has been done by a small number of researchers, including  
**[0:16:11-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:11):**  from the European Food Safety Agency and other European partners. It has been done recently,  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:17):**  but only with a very small number of landmark studies, I'd say. And so it's only been until  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:21):**  recently that we've had that fairly solid evidence, but it's still contended and it's  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:26):**  the evidence is still scant, I would say. So yes, I think that there has been that concern  
**[0:16:31-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:31):**  within certain groups that there isn't enough evidence to suggest that we need to make drastic  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:36):**  changes to our antimicrobial usage and production systems and our agriculture as a result.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:40):**  Are you able to talk us through that? How does antimicrobial resistance spread between  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:46):**  people and animals and the environment, that whole thing?  
**[0:16:49-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:49):**  Sure, yeah. So there's plenty of evidence to back up the notion that the usage of antibiotics  
**[0:16:56-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:16:56):**  in either an animal or a person leads to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. That's  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:00):**  fairly well documented, although even that is pretty complex in that there are very specific  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:05):**  there's a very specific combination of antimicrobials and bacteria that that need to interact in  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:12):**  order to see that risk of antimicrobial resistance emerging. So even that's quite complicated,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:16):**  but there is fairly good evidence that the usage of some antibiotics will lead to the  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:20):**  emergence of certain types of drug resistant bacteria. So that's fairly solid. And the  
**[0:17:25-0:17:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:25):**  links between the emergence of that particular antibiotic resistant bacteria moving from  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:31):**  an animal to a person, that's fairly well documented too. We see that there's various  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:36):**  researchers that have kind of swabbed animals or farming environments and found antimicrobial  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:41):**  resistance in farming operations and linked those to the shedding of pathogens in the  
**[0:17:46-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:46):**  farming family or in stock people. That's fairly well documented. But then the whole  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:52):**  chain of antimicrobial usage in an animal right through to clinical disease in a person  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:17:58):**  is quite challenging to knit together. But it has and does happen on occasions. So there  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:05):**  are various means by which that bacteria can spread from an animal to a person. In that  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:11):**  example, with a farming family, we've obviously got direct contact. And that's particularly  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:15):**  a problem for animal health workers, so vets, but also farmers and stock people, abattoir  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:21):**  workers and processes. So the people have literally hands on interactions with with  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:25):**  livestock. We've then got the consumption of food. So this is where consumers and citizens  
**[0:18:30-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:30):**  come into the equation. We see sometimes that antimicrobial resistant bugs end up on food  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:35):**  products. And so when we handle them in our kitchens or consume undercooked food, we can  
**[0:18:40-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:40):**  acquire antimicrobial resistant diseases.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:43):**  So these are kind of the superbugs.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:44):**  Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And then the final...  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:47):**  Give us some names, give us some examples.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:49):**  So Campylobacter would be a really good one on uncooked chicken. And that's been a very  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:53):**  sort of broadly publicised issue. Certainly Campylobacter in itself is a major foodborne  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:18:58):**  problem, foodborne pathogen for people across the world. But there are instances where we've  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:03):**  seen, for example, fluoroquinolone resistance in Campylobacter that go on to form superbugs  
**[0:19:09-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:09):**  and infections in people that are very, very hard to treat. And some of that has been traced  
**[0:19:14-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:14):**  back to the usage of enofloxacin in chickens. So that's a fairly well publicised example.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:20):**  And then the final pathway from animals to people is via the environment. So the shedding  
**[0:19:26-0:19:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:26):**  of either antibiotic residues or antimicrobial resistant determinants or pathogens from those  
**[0:19:33-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:33):**  that have been treated in effluent. So that's both people and animals shedding resistance  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:38):**  that can end up in waterways and soils, etc., and go on to infect people that way. And depending  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:44):**  on where we are in the world, that could mean that it ends up in our water systems or in  
**[0:19:48-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:48):**  water for bathing and etc., etc. So that the environmental contamination is also a concern.  
**[0:19:54-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:54):**  Fantastic. That's really interesting, really clear. Thank you very much for that. There  
**[0:19:58-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:19:58):**  are loads of antibiotics out there, but some are more important than others. There's a  
**[0:20:02-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:02):**  kind of a tiering, isn't there? There are human critical antibiotics and then others  
**[0:20:06-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:06):**  that are less important. And how is it that we're supposedly differentiating this?  
**[0:20:10-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:10):**  Yeah, so our global institutions, such as the World Health Organisation and the World  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:14):**  Organisation for Animal Health, the OIE, have both classified our antibiotic arsenal into  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:20):**  various categories according to their importance to both human health and to animal health.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:25):**  And probably the most influential is the World Health Organisation's list of critically important  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:29):**  antimicrobials. And of that list, they have pulled out what's called the highest priority  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:34):**  critically important antibiotics, which consists of four classes, the fluoroquinolones, the  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:39):**  macrolides, the third and fourth generation cephalosporins and colistin, also known as  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:44):**  the last resort antibiotic. And those are the ones we hear a lot about in terms of restricting  
**[0:20:49-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:49):**  their usage for when they're really needed, not only in people, because these are the  
**[0:20:53-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:53):**  drugs that are used in very, very serious infections with very few alternatives for  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:20:59):**  treatment. So they're really, they're really classed as critical and precious, if you like,  
**[0:21:03-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:03):**  for human health. But in the animal world, they're used also quite widely in many jurisdictions.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:09):**  And so of course, we're under even more pressure in the veterinary and animal agriculture worlds  
**[0:21:13-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:13):**  to restrict our usage of these so-called HPCIAs. And that's where again, FAI's advice comes  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:20):**  in that we're creating these policy positions to try and restrict usage of these particularly  
**[0:21:25-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:25):**  precious antibiotics for when they're really needed and backed up with diagnostic testing.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:29):**  Okay, so you've convinced me, I'm a citizen, I'm out in the supermarket, what can I do?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:36):**  Is there some way that I can avoid food that has been stuffed full of antibiotics?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:41):**  Yes, there's no stamp. You'll be disappointed to hear it's not as simple as that, like an  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:45):**  organic stamp or a red tractor stamp or any of the others. It's not as simple as that.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:50):**  But doesn't the organic stamp tell us that, you know, there's less antibiotic use?  
**[0:21:54-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:54):**  There's certainly stricter regulation in the organic sector around the usage of medicines  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:21:59):**  such as antibiotics. So it could be a good place to start. But again, it's quite nuanced.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:04):**  There are studies to show that antibiotic usage in organic agriculture is lower in certain  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:09):**  species. But there is also conflicting evidence to suggest that actually, in some organic  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:13):**  production systems, access to an outdoor range and access to wildlife also can be a source  
**[0:22:19-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:19):**  of infectious disease and therefore a risk factor for antibiotic usage. It's not as simple  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:23):**  as it might seem, fortunately.  
**[0:22:25-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:25):**  So I mean, just looking for something like organic or some more sort of sustainable,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:30):**  higher quality, higher welfare type brand isn't enough. It's very difficult. There isn't  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:35):**  a label that's out there, certainly in the UK, that says antibiotic. There is in the  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:39):**  US, though, isn't there? There is an antibiotic.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:42):**  There is. In the US and a few other markets, you have seen the emergence of antibiotic  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:48):**  free production.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:49):**  So that's good, yeah.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:51):**  It's driving awareness, I guess, about the issue. We should all be more responsible about  
**[0:22:57-0:23:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:22:57):**  how we handle and use these medicines. And antibiotic free is one way and it's sort of  
**[0:23:05-0:23:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:05):**  at one end of the spectrum. But to your point earlier, there are times when animals need  
**[0:23:11-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:11):**  treatment. We believe that that can be done in a responsible way where you're still keeping  
**[0:23:17-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:17):**  overall usage really low and the risk to resistance also really low. So that's why we're sort  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:23):**  of taking that broader approach where every company should be thinking about what does  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:29):**  that responsible use look like for them? What are the right metrics to be reporting on in  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:35):**  order to show that they're making progress, that they're sending that message to their  
**[0:23:39-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:39):**  suppliers, the suppliers understand what's expected of them, and that then ultimately  
**[0:23:43-0:23:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:43):**  filters down to farmers, to veterinarians who can support that type of system that doesn't  
**[0:23:50-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:50):**  rely on routine use of antibiotics.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:53):**  I want to pick up on something that you mentioned 10 minutes or so ago, where you were talking  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:23:56):**  about the risks that businesses are facing. And so let's connect that now. We know that  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:02):**  the food businesses, that food in general, the way that food is produced, the routine  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:07):**  use of antibiotics is driving antimicrobial resistance. This is something that we as citizens  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:12):**  and that the policy world cares about. But at the same time, as citizens, it's very difficult  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:17):**  for us to do an awful lot about it. So we kind of rely on organisations like FAIR that  
**[0:24:22-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:22):**  you mentioned before, the Rumour Alliance, and other NGOs. And are the NGOs somehow,  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:28):**  are they being successful?  
**[0:24:29-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:29):**  I think so. I think the investors coming together and putting this right on their agenda is  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:37):**  a very powerful signal. It's important for, you know, that's a message that cuts across  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:42):**  every level of a company when your key big institutional investors are asking you questions  
**[0:24:48-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:48):**  about your antimicrobial stewardship. It gets it up on the agenda. Same with the types of  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:24:56):**  rankings that you see from both NGOs and investors are important, keeping this issue alive, keeping  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:03):**  the focus on them. And then obviously, the hard work is in implementing the change. And  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:10):**  I guess that's where FAI position ourselves. We think that we can, you know, we can help  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:15):**  the companies that understand that this is something they need to tackle, but don't necessarily  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:20):**  know what the next steps are.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:22):**  Okay, so think of a company and tell us an example of best practice.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:26):**  So it starts at the governance level. So it starts with recognising AMR, microbial resistance,  
**[0:25:33-0:25:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:33):**  as a key threat, then spelling out a clear policy, typically associated with goals and,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:41):**  you know, clear outcomes that this policy is going to drive in their supply chain, specifying  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:46):**  what species they're concerned with, what sectors they're working in, and what approach  
**[0:25:51-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:51):**  they're taking to both recording antimicrobial use, improving and sort of refining the use  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:25:57):**  of antimicrobial use and also overall reducing the use.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:02):**  Then the next step is measuring it. So getting a handle on the data, engaging with suppliers,  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:09):**  that's what we have a tool for, to get the right information in. And that does take some  
**[0:26:14-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:14):**  handholding and take some support and training for the suppliers to understand what information  
**[0:26:21-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:21):**  is expected, why they're being asked to report this information, and then importantly, what's  
**[0:26:26-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:26):**  going to happen with this information? What are you going to do with this? And we work  
**[0:26:31-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:31):**  with a large company that is doing this across their entire global poultry supply chain to  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:36):**  really get a handle on where are the high risk areas, where are the areas where they  
**[0:26:42-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:42):**  can learn from, where is this a really big problem, and where should they put more resource,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:48):**  if you like, and more effort into combating this particular threat.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:26:54):**  And then finally, we think there's an important role of training and education on this subject.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:00):**  It is complicated, as this podcast has shown to it, it's complicated in vocabulary. The  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:07):**  science is there, but it's complex. And just disseminating more information and training  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:14):**  about that topic for people that work in the food chain.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:18):**  So really, to summarise that, we're looking for food businesses to have really clear policy  
**[0:27:23-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:23):**  around antimicrobials and antibiotic usage, which then leads to measuring that usage actually  
**[0:27:30-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:30):**  within the supply chain, doing that data recording, reporting then that data, first of all within  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:36):**  that individual company, but ideally reporting it in a way that is public and transparent,  
**[0:27:41-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:41):**  and sharing best practice within that supply chain so that individual farmers, individual  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:45):**  processors are able to work out what they're doing well, what they're not doing quite so  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:49):**  well, and then make those adjustments within their production system. So essentially, reduce,  
**[0:27:54-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:54):**  refine, replace.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:27:55):**  Correct. I think that's exactly right. And I think that, you know, combined that is a  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:00):**  really strong signal effect. It's a signal effect through that public stakeholder reporting,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:06):**  showing the what you are doing to your peers, you get that recognition also in the public  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:11):**  rankings, whether that's fair or other other NGOs, your investors see that you're taking  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:18):**  this seriously.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:19):**  Well, it sounds like it's a societal threat in terms of the health of society in terms  
**[0:28:24-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:24):**  of economics, when we think of that enormous figure, the cost of increasing antimicrobial  
**[0:28:30-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:30):**  resistance over the course of the next 30 years to 2050. But also, there's a reputational  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:35):**  risk for those companies as well, isn't there? And as citizens become more aware of this,  
**[0:28:39-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:39):**  as NGOs work harder to drive change in food supply chains and amongst the brands, as we  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:45):**  have global rankings like the fair index, that's the sort of thing that will hopefully  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:50):**  drive us to the kind of change that we need to see. Well, look, that's been fascinating.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Tackling-antimicrobial-resistance-emu5h0#t=0:28:55):**  Thanks very much. But that's all we have time for. So I'd like to thank my guests, Laura

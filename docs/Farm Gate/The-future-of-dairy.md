### Author(s): ffinlo Costain  

**[0:00:00-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke Steyn, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. This is the final programme in a series in  which I talk to regenerative dairy producers as part of the Regen Dairy project set up  
**[0:00:19-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:00:19):**  by FAI Farms and Farmwell. Through the project, we're working with farmers and dairy businesses  to help to define what regenerative dairy looks like and to build a practical vision  for a productive and profitable global dairy sector that also restores its relationship  
**[0:00:34-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:00:34):**  with nature. Today we're visiting Germany and I'm talking to Anja Hrudetski who farms  at Hofstolze Küh in North East Brandenburg and Annabel Girard who farms at Hofstangsel  in Lower Saxony. Welcome both. Thank you very much. Hello. Now you're going to tell me that  
**[0:00:51-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:00:51):**  the pronunciations of those weren't quite right. So Anja, perhaps you could tell me  how to pronounce your farm's name and also what it means in English. My farm is called  Hofstolze Küh. So this is proud cow farm in English. And the name comes from the cows  
**[0:01:06-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:01:06):**  who have horns and we live in Stolzenhagen, so the same start of the name. And we become  proud parents and we will keep their calf. That's why they are proud cows. Fantastic.  That's great. And that was so different to the way that I said it. And Annabel, how do  
**[0:01:22-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:01:22):**  I pronounce your farm? Our farm is called Hofstangsel. It doesn't have any meaning.  It's the name of the small village we are located in. We have eight houses here in this  village and we are one. We are the only farm in this village. It would be fair to say,  
**[0:01:41-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:01:41):**  wouldn't it, that regenerative agriculture is not yet very common in Germany. How did  you first become aware of it? That is true. I studied organic agricultural  sciences at university from 2005 until 2009. And I never heard something about regenerative  
**[0:02:01-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:02:01):**  agriculture. So my entry into regenerative agriculture took place in 2018 in a situation  of crisis where we were facing drought problems at our farm. The farm we leased 10 years ago  is located on sandy soils with really poor water holding capacity. We started a diversified  
**[0:02:24-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:02:24):**  mixed organic farm enterprise with a small dairy herd and with beef cattle. Really from  the beginning, we were facing certain drought problems and it was really clear that it's  a challenging place. And we tended to always have a lack of pasture fodder and forage for  
**[0:02:43-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:02:43):**  winter. And then came 2018, which was exceptional dry. We were running out of fodder already  in summer and we started to feed the hay for the winter in July and hoped for a second  cut of hay, but there was no second cut. So it was really substantial and psychologically  
**[0:03:04-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:03:04):**  distressing for us. And I felt like a victim and a perpetrator of climate change at the  same time. So yes, I felt helplessly delivered and I didn't see a perspective. And that was  the point where I started questioning our way of farming because all the years I thought  
**[0:03:24-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:03:24):**  that we were on the right way because we've harmed organically, but this situation made  me be open minded. Then I got to know holistic management developed by Alan Savory in really  brittle environments of this world. And this was my entry into regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:03:42-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:03:42):**  It came through holistic plant grazing. It really changed my mindset completely and my  way of farming grasslands and arable lands and my way of keeping livestock. I found the  TED talk of Alan Savory, which he did in 2013. And this was really the door opener for me  
**[0:04:04-0:04:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:04:04):**  because I heard that and it was like, okay, if something is true, what he's saying, then  I have hope again at our place, farming at our place.  One of the things that you said when I've spoken to you in the past is that you've started  
**[0:04:21-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:04:21):**  to think of meat and milk as a by-product of good land management. What do you mean  by that?  Yes, that concerns to my shift in mindset. And yes, it forced me to start thinking in  
**[0:04:36-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:04:36):**  ecosystem processes. Every farmer knows two ways of keeping soils fertile. One is organic  fertilizer. That's kind of traditional method and mostly part of the circular farming. And  everybody knows artificial fertilizer. That is the conventional way of fertilizer. It's  
**[0:04:59-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:04:59):**  often produced with a high input of energy and it's the more industrial way of farming.  But if we want to use the power of nature for agriculture, we have to know these four  ecosystem processes that are inherent in every ecosystem of the world. And that is the water  
**[0:05:20-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:05:20):**  cycle, the mineral cycle, the community dynamics and the energy flow from the sun. The natural  fertility in ecosystems develops through the interaction of these four processes. And if  you want to build stable and resilient farming systems, we have to make decisions and actions  
**[0:05:40-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:05:40):**  that improve these four processes instead of always working against them. Ironically,  the ruminants are wonderful tools to improve the ecosystem processes if we manage them  in a good way. But they can have a destructive effect on the land if they are mismanaged.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:06:00):**  And that was what we experienced in the past. So my former thinking was really more orientated  on yield and how to maximize yield. So for example, our goal was to milk 6500 kilo milk  per cow per year. And we tried everything to produce the quantity and quality of forage  
**[0:06:21-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:06:21):**  and pasture to reach our goal. But our grassland was not well managed. And we failed because  our land was not resilient to weather extremes. Today, we try to keep our cattle in a way  that they improve this for ecosystem processes. And in doing so we create or we try to create  
**[0:06:44-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:06:44):**  healthy soils, healthy plants, healthy animals, and healthy humans. By this way, we produce  food, but we also create biodiversity and face climate change. We search for an optimum  not longer for maximum we focus to improve the land. And by this way, we also produce  
**[0:07:05-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:07:05):**  milk and meat. Fantastic. And just sort of Anja, if I come to you sort of going into  that idea that Annabelle was talking about there that, you know, cattle can be destructive  at the same time as cattle can be regenerative. And we keep hearing don't we through the media  
**[0:07:22-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:07:22):**  that cattle are a problem that they drive global warming, that dairy farming is damaging  biodiversity and water cycles. Now, you don't see it that way, do you? Why do you see cows  as a solution to these challenges? Well, I can see the part that is written in the newspaper.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:07:38):**  And we have neighbour farms, industrial farms that have milk 200, 2000 head of cows. And  I think this is what is meant in the newspaper. So there are a lot of methane going to the  atmosphere. And it's just continuing like this. And we have still what Annabelle told  
**[0:07:59-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:07:59):**  me, the yield thing, we really push the 10,000, 12,000 litre per year cow. I always had my  cattle on the pasture. I know because we didn't have a barn. We just started like that. And  I was reading a good German book. It's from Anita Edel. The cow is not a climate killer.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:08:19):**  And she really explained how the ruminants work inside and how their effect can be when  we graze. And I thought, yeah, that's what I always thought, that it's a difference when  the cows are grazing. And there's carbon fixed in the soil and working with legumes and just  
**[0:08:40-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:08:40):**  a different use of the land. Yeah, that's just not common. It's really rare that dairy  cows are grazing in Germany, maybe in the northern part of Germany. There it's more  common and we have pasture programmes there. So the farmers keep the cows outside. But  
**[0:08:58-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:08:58):**  in our northeast region, former GDR, it's just normal to have all the mechanic stuff  inside and yeah, have the cows produce a lot of milk, but also a lot of climate gas.  And how is your farm different then? You've talked there about the way in which quite  
**[0:09:15-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:09:15):**  a lot of the farms surrounding you are problematic in terms of, you know, you mentioned methane  there, you mentioned biodiversity. What's different about your farm?  Yeah, we work on 110 hectares of national park grassland. There the bird protection  
**[0:09:29-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:09:29):**  is a high goal. So their mob grazing comes into conflict, because I'm not allowed to  make smaller pastures. But from the first of July, I'm allowed to and we have dual purpose  breeds. We are all year from their birth to their death on the pasture. We milk 46 cows  
**[0:09:49-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:09:49):**  at the moment. And yeah, we just eat grass. No grain that has to be brought from somewhere.  No shit that has to be brought to somewhere. And it's just falling where we eat and we  trample it and the organic matter can grow. Just when we come out, sometimes farmers visit  
**[0:10:13-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:10:13):**  us. And I'm open for that. So we can really see it and understand and feel it. And sometimes  they say, oh, all the problems we have, they are made by ourselves. And I say, yeah, first  step is taken.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:10:24):**  Thanks so much, Anja. And why don't we just take a pause at this moment and just spend  some time talking about your farms in a bit more detail, because of course, there are  going to be lots of farmers listening to this and they always want to know the details.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:10:36):**  So Annabelle, could you tell us a bit about where you farm? You know, what the climate's  like? What do you produce? And, you know, how would you describe your dairy operation  to other farmers?  
**[0:10:47-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:10:47):**  It is located in the north of Germany, in the northeast of Lower Saxony. The farm and  60 acres of the land is owned by a nonprofit organization. And we are not a typical family  farm, but we are three families and we leased the farm for 30 years. All together, we have  
**[0:11:05-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:11:05):**  more land. All together, we farm 300 acres and 200 acres of our grassland and 100 acres  of arable land. And because we are so diversified, we have 10 employees all together. And my  husband and me, we are responsible for the agriculture. That means for livestock keeping  
**[0:11:29-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:11:29):**  and for the grassland and for the arable land. So our context of keeping dairy cattle is  a really diversified organic farm. We have 16 acres of vegetables and we have 200 layer  cows. We have sow and bore and fattening pigs as feed converters and we keep 30 cows. 25  
**[0:11:51-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:11:51):**  of them we are milking and five are nurses for the cows. And we milk around 5,000 kilogram  per cow per year. The feed ration contains a high percentage of grass and grass-based  fodder, but we also feed a small amount of corn silage, which we crop since 2019 because  
**[0:12:14-0:12:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:12:14):**  for the food security of our cows because it was so dry and we were running out of fodder.  So we keep four different cows, cow breeds and make this out of it because we are searching  for genetics that fit to our conditions, also to our transition to regenerative dairy. So  
**[0:12:34-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:12:34):**  we keep Holstein Frisian and old German Frisian. We keep Brown Swiss and we keep original Brown  Swiss. We try to keep all the calves born on our farm and we raise and finish them by  grass. So all together that means we have around 100 heads of cattle.  
**[0:12:55-0:13:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:12:55):**  And when do you carve Annabelle? Is it spring or autumn or year round?  At the moment it's all year round because our marketing is really all year round and  our consumers are happy to have milk and milk products all year round. So we process our  
**[0:13:14-0:13:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:13:14):**  milk completely on our farm. We have a known dairy processing. We produce a wide range  of products like different types of cheese and yogurt and all this diversity is possible  because of our direct marketing. It's called CSA, Community Supported Agriculture, and  
**[0:13:34-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:13:34):**  that means we have really a strong relationship with our customers and that gives us planning  security and a stable amount of income because they pay a fixed monthly amount and in return  they get our products.  
**[0:13:51-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:13:51):**  So rather than having a contract with a supermarket, with a retailer for example, you have a contract  direct with the citizens.  Yes, that's true. And we supply 250 households every week with our products. And yes, because  
**[0:14:05-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:14:05):**  you asked for the barn, we build it a simple and open stable for our dairy cows to improve  the winter situation in 2019. Our dairy cows are from December until April. They're in  the stable. We collect the manure because it's also a strong part for our vegetable  
**[0:14:26-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:14:26):**  growing and for the circular farming for parts of the arable land. So for us, it's really  necessary to collect, but we also have a herd of young cattle, pifers and oxen, and we keep  them outside the whole year and we try to integrate them in the best way into the grassland  
**[0:14:46-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:14:46):**  and also into the arable land. And we do bale grazing and grazing of cover crops or whatever.  Fantastic. That's brilliant. And Anja, if I can come to you with this sort of similar  question, so in a similar vein, can you tell us a bit about your farm?  
**[0:14:59-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:14:59):**  Yeah, we have quite the same size of farm. I just calculated it. So it's 270 acres of  grassland and 345 acres of arable land. We do a lot of legume, alpha-alpha, clover on  it. We also graze it and make hay out of it. We are a certified hay milk farm and we process  
**[0:15:25-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:15:25):**  all our milk as well on our farm. At the moment, we look for people who take it responsibly  over, so we don't have to have it all on our shoulders. So we will see how this works out.  Our main market is Berlin, so I drove every week to Berlin and brought it to direct customers,  
**[0:15:42-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:15:42):**  to little shops that can communicate what we are doing differently with the horns, with  the calves, with breeding with our own bulls. And we have a new bull now. It's a original  brown Swiss bull and it's the baby of Annabel's cow. So I think it's really important to take  
**[0:16:02-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:16:02):**  over the breeding and have it more in our hands so we are not addicted to some global  breeding programs. We have these original brown Swiss cows and we have the red ones  that came from the north part of Germany, northern part of Germany. This was the former  
**[0:16:22-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:16:22):**  butter cow. We also crossed in Jersey and some we mix and some we breed direct, so it's  quite good. And we have 130 head at the moment, all grazed all year outside.  Fantastic. And we're going to come on to some of the detail about your system a little bit  
**[0:16:40-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:16:40):**  later in terms of your carving and the way that you out-winter as well. But one of the  biggest challenges that you've talked to me about in the past is low rainfall. And I wonder  if you could talk us through why you see Regen Agriculture as a solution to that low rainfall.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:16:57):**  We have only 350 to 400 millimeters per year. I think it's quite the same Annabel's region.  And we have sandy soil in the national park. It's the lower Oder Valley. So there's a river  and there's a lot of zedge. So it's different from the sandy parts. But this year everything  
**[0:17:15-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:17:15):**  was brown on the farms around. And I still had alpha alpha until as high as my knees  were always when I came to the cows. And I moved them to an alpha alpha field this year  and let them up mop graze this pasture. I think I did it four times and normally it's  
**[0:17:36-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:17:36):**  just one cut. And our neighbor, that's quite interesting, he was cutting it because he  has 250 dairy cows in the barn. And he was cutting it very low. And I could see it because  if our fields were just next to each other. Good that he is using alpha alpha, but it was not regenerating  
**[0:17:54-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:17:54):**  as fast as my one, my field that was trampled. And the alpha alpha loves it to be grazed  only three days maximum. And then it grows through the trampled litter. And that was  so fascinating to see this. His plants were still tiny and mine were already 15 to 20 centimeters.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:18:15):**  And so with that, I don't need rain. I can do it without rain.  And with that, you say that the cattle are on there for three days. How long is the rest  period then?  
**[0:18:26-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:18:26):**  I think it's about 30 to 40 days. It depends a little bit. I think I could have been faster  because it was already high enough again. But I wanted to go until the end and don't  let my husband come mowing it. I will figure it out more in detail. It was the first time  
**[0:18:42-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:18:42):**  using alpha alpha just in the middle of the summer. Normally, I do it only in autumn when  the national park season is over and we have to leave it. So I will still continue my own  research every year. And this year, I just did it by my feeling. I often changed the  
**[0:18:59-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:18:59):**  pasture every day. But sometimes over the weekend, it's good to be prepared and somebody  else is milking, we don't have to do it. So I'm really flexible with it and I love it.  Because you were talking about it being very low rainfall up where you are and sandy soil  
**[0:19:14-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:19:14):**  as well, which obviously won't help in terms of that water retention. I wonder, you know,  is dairy common in that region? Is it an unusual thing to be doing? And is it a surprise that  you're being successful?  
**[0:19:26-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:19:26):**  It's very common to do corn dairy, based on corn, based on soy, based on leftover from  oil production, based on a lot of grain. So 15 to 20 kilos is normal. And yeah, it's not  coming from our region, the food, maybe it's coming from South America. And we know what  
**[0:19:48-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:19:48):**  this all brings with it. But still, it's important how cheap the milk is in the supermarket.  And I think that's a big problem. So I think our neighbors really watch us and look how  we grow the food for our cows, how we sell it. We always say it's a niche, no, we can't  
**[0:20:07-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:20:07):**  do it all like you do it. But I hope that step by step it will come that it's normal  to have the cows outside.  That niche gets bigger and bigger and bigger and finally takes over.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:20:18):**  What I forgot to talk about, we have a mobile parlor. So I'm really flexible to go wherever  I have food for the cows, I can move there. It's on wheels. And I have a, behind my pickup,  I have a mobile tank, so I can get the milk in and I have water tanks to wash the parlor.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:20:37):**  And it's so easy, like the cows get along with it. And I love to milk outside where  there's no borders, no stone walls. Just I look into the green all day as well, but also  when I'm milking.  
**[0:20:51-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:20:51):**  That sounds wonderful. The whole system of the farm sounds fantastic. And you know, I  remember when we've talked that you've told me that sometimes you feel a bit ashamed of  it. And why is that?  
**[0:21:00-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:21:00):**  Yeah, the shame is a little bit because it's always everybody's talking about the yield  and how many liters we get out of the cows. And we get 4500 to 5000 liters and we let  the cows suckle first, the calves suckle first on the cows directly this year the first time.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:21:17):**  And we suckle 1000 to 1500 liters. So I get only 3000 liters out of my cow. I don't have  to put all this energy in and all this fuel and all the corn and what is coming from somewhere  else. But this professor from my university where I was studying, he said, with this amount  
**[0:21:34-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:21:34):**  of milk, we don't have to talk any longer. And I thought, oh shit, I thought it's a good  start. It's pioneering. But yeah, some people are just not open for it. And it's good that  we can talk now and that we can spread the word and I am speaking on conferences as well  
**[0:21:51-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:21:51):**  about it. But this old school thinking somehow I can call it like this. It stops me sometimes.  And yeah, I can see that I'm living in a world that's maybe not really prepared for it. Like  I face the problems and I take over solutions and I look for solutions and I just start  
**[0:22:08-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:22:08):**  doing it. But all the counselors, we still say, come on, you have to put more grain into  your cows. So we get more milk and we don't like it just can calculate it and it's not  working. The farmers are still taught the same way. So that's really makes me sad and  
**[0:22:26-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:22:26):**  ashamed of the system maybe. But at the end of the day, you are producing  milk, you are earning a good living, you're farming and regenerating nature at the same  time. So that, you know, that really is something to be proud of. So perhaps after we've recorded  
**[0:22:41-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:22:41):**  this podcast, you could send this to your professor and he can have and listen to it  and then talk about it in the future. Now, Annabelle, your big objective is to run a  successful dairy system with zero fossil fuels. How close are you to that now and what else  
**[0:22:57-0:23:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:22:57):**  do you need to do? Yes, Finnlow, just to say it at the beginning,  we are far away from working without fossil fuels. But my husband and me, we try to find  farm-based solutions for this task because it's clear the next years and decades we will  
**[0:23:19-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:23:19):**  struggle with this energy questions and we have to find solutions and nobody can help  us in a way. We have to find farm-based solutions. Everybody believes in technical innovation.  That's a part of the solution we think. And we are also working on technical innovation.  
**[0:23:40-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:23:40):**  The first topic is renewable energy. So we try to produce our own energy. That means  this year we installed photovoltaic system with storage capacity that enables us to be  energy self-sufficient in terms of balance sheet. But not in reality. We have to bridge  
**[0:24:04-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:24:04):**  the winter gap from March until October. We have enough power and enough heating by the  sun now. But from November till February, we have to find another solution for power,  for electricity and for heating. And we are thinking what would be the best solution.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:24:27):**  Would it be wood or would it be biogas, own produced biogas, but not by slurry, by manure  mixed with straw. Electricity, producing electricity is switched very well with an E-wheel loader  or with one or two electric cars maybe. But the diesel question is not solved because  
**[0:24:51-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:24:51):**  we have tractors and they need a lot of horse powers for several hours and here we have  to wait for innovation because we are not able to solve it on a farm-based level.  So there's a kind of a two-pronged situation. There are things that you can do and things  
**[0:25:07-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:25:07):**  that you need to wait for other people to do and hopefully the two of those will come  together.  And there's another topic of technical innovation. It's the belief that it's the solution. That  
**[0:25:19-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:25:19):**  means that the ground assumption is to become more and more efficient. And if we transfer  that to dairy farming, that means that we have to develop a real high input dairy keeping  with high milk yields. If you think in these terms, you have to work continuously to increase  
**[0:25:43-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:25:43):**  the milk yield to justify the high inputs or to balance the high inputs. But these inputs,  they are really addicted by fossil fuels. And this way of farming that needs really  high energy inputs. So I think it's a reductionist way of keeping animals. And because this striving  
**[0:26:05-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:26:05):**  for efficiency is so reductionist, it's the opposite of sustainability. So I think the  ultimate consequence will be to replace the dairy cattle with machines or technical processes  to produce milk because the technical solutions will be more energy efficient and less polluting  
**[0:26:27-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:26:27):**  than the dairy cattle. So if we try to develop a regenerative mindset for keeping dairy cattle,  we should try to look at a really holistic perspective. And that means for me, first  of all, our task is to reduce the consumption of industrial energy that has the greatest  
**[0:26:50-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:26:50):**  effect. But the question is, how can we do that, especially if the relationship between  human labor and fossil energy is really unfair? A person can produce one kilowatt hour in 10  hours of work, and it costs around 130 euro. And this is comparable to 100 milliliters  
**[0:27:14-0:27:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:27:14):**  of diesel. And this costs about 20 euro cents. So the fossil fuels are too cheap, even now  they are too cheap. But if we try to reduce the energy level, then it's about creating  a low energy input system with an appropriate sustainable output. But the output will be  
**[0:27:34-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:27:34):**  milk and meat and birds and flies and worms and microbiology, butterflies, carbon sequestration,  water infiltration, spiders, many different plants. So it will be a really holistic output.  The key is using photosynthesis as directly as possible. So photosynthesis is the energy  
**[0:27:57-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:27:57):**  of regenerative agriculture. It's the motor. And it's the answer to our energy problems  we are facing. And it's also the answer of our carbon problems. So if we look at our  farm, we try to draw the following conclusions from this. First of all, we should not feed  
**[0:28:16-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:28:16):**  grain to ruminants, because that is really energy intensive grown. We should work for  reducing the corn silage because it's also high energy grown. And we should work or improve  the perennial grasslands because they are self-sustaining. That's permaculture. That's  
**[0:28:34-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:28:34):**  what we want to improve. And we should use the cows as tools because they are the workers.  They are the landscapers and we manage them.  Annabel, there was something that you said in the middle there that I thought was really  
**[0:28:53-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:28:53):**  fascinating. And I just want to play it back to you in the way that I've understood it.  And just check that this is kind of what you were saying. That within the industrial model,  which is pushing for ever greater efficiency, but which has ever higher external costs in  
**[0:29:09-0:29:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:29:09):**  terms of society and the environment, that there's a degree to which there is a diminishing  social license and that this process is likely to be taken over by technology, perhaps even  by plant-based milk production in the future. And so actually regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:29:30-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:29:30):**  regenerative dairy is the way to save the dairy industry. Am I understanding that correctly?  Yes, I think so. Because the consequence, if we think in technical solutions, the consequence  is that we don't need the dairy cows anymore in 10 years, 20 years, we don't know when,  
**[0:29:50-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:29:50):**  but sometimes it will take place. We see the beginning already with the plant-based milk,  but now they are trying to ferment the grass in a machine to produce milk. So we see that  the first steps of this evolution. And if we think until the end, so we don't need to  
**[0:30:12-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:30:12):**  have dairy cows anymore. So if we want to keep dairy cows in a way that is sustainable  and acceptable to people. Yes. So we have to integrate them into the grasslands. And  yes, they have to convert the plants that are not usable for us.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:30:34):**  Now, we've talked a lot of science there and a lot about what your hopes are for the system  and how you're going to decarbonise. This is a very different sort of question that  I'm going to move on to now. And you were part of our Regen Dairy Round the World Tour.  
**[0:30:48-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:30:48):**  And you told us a fantastic story about how you wanted to implement adaptive multipadic  grazing and your husband didn't agree. And so you had to go off and do it yourself until  he did and came around. I'm curious to know how you manage disagreement. And this is the  
**[0:31:04-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:31:04):**  same for all working couples, I'm sure in farming. But when you're married to your principal  work and business partner and there is a disagreement, how do you manage that?  Yeah, that was really a complicated situation. And it sounded a little bit like an impending  
**[0:31:23-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:31:23):**  divorce when he said, you can try that, but you have to do it alone. So our approach is  to work close together and to make joint decisions. So it was really hard for me, but I felt that  I have to try it. I have to go this way.  
**[0:31:43-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:31:43):**  So did you just not talk to each other for two months until he came around? Or was it  that you kind of said, OK, we disagree and let's move on and talk about something else?  No, it was OK. But yes, it was somehow strange. He was just watching the past years and I  
**[0:32:02-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:32:02):**  did the work. And yes, it took four or five months and then we were both convinced. So  we both saw the effects of that management and they were really visible for us. And because  we both struggled over years with these specific pastures and the growing conditions. So the  
**[0:32:24-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:32:24):**  effect was obvious for both of us. And that was the point where we started to continue  our way together. And now it's really a strong part of our work and of our relationship.  And it's so perfect because we visited them and Chris was the biggest fan of the system.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:32:44):**  So yeah, it came out very well.  Fantastic. So he's kind of gone full circle. That's brilliant. Anja, coming back to you,  we touched on one or two of these elements a little bit earlier, but just to go into  
**[0:32:55-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:32:55):**  them in a bit more detail now, you run a full cow with calf system and your calves are with  their mothers until they're four or five months old. Why is that important to you? Why is  the cow with calf thing important?  
**[0:33:07-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:33:07):**  I had some moments on farms where I worked where I noticed this is evolution, where we  humans create on one farm, the calves couldn't suckle out of the tit anymore. They could  suckle out of a rubber on the bucket easily, but to catch the tit with their tongue, they  
**[0:33:31-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:33:31):**  weren't able to do it. And I thought, that's crazy. That's nature. How can we stop it by  taking these calves as cows later that can't do it anymore? And the second really impressive  situation was when we let the cows out for grazing in the north Italian mountains, then  
**[0:33:54-0:34:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:33:54):**  the calves should just follow them to the pasture, but they didn't follow. They just  didn't have the herd instinct anymore because we were separated. And this shocked me so  much. And I told myself, this will never happen on my farm, on my own farm where I can't  
**[0:34:08-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:34:08):**  even decide how things go on. And so I see my calves grow so good when they're outside  with their mothers. We learn where the water is, how the fence works, how we graze. We  eat grass so early, we grow so perfect. And when I wean them, we continue grazing, of  
**[0:34:28-0:34:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:34:28):**  course. I wean them fence line. I do fence line weaning. I learned a method in Canada  that is called low stress stockmanship. So I don't have to put so much pressure on cattle.  We just try to understand me. Or I just tell them in their body language what they should  
**[0:34:50-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:34:50):**  do. And this is what the cows do. And the calves just learn it by going with them. And  so I never have a problem with aggressive bulls. It's just normal for them that a human  is coming and we listen to them. We have a number of problems with their lungs, with  
**[0:35:08-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:35:08):**  their digestion, with feet. I can really breed for that. Yeah, I'm really good in it. So  I think you have to really want it to do it. Like mine, it's already a worse problem because  my husband doesn't want to do the cow and calf at the beginning. Maybe you have to be  
**[0:35:26-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:35:26):**  like a nurse for them at the beginning. We carve outside and I have to have an eye on  them and sometimes a cow is too nervous and it's her first calf and she doesn't know how  to do it. Then I bring her in. I have a little paddock for these kind of cows to help them  
**[0:35:43-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:35:43):**  get along with the calf. And then they can be outside again and I don't have the work  of washing the buckets, which I don't like. So I just skip this part. Yeah, I just enjoy  this. We are mammals as well as humans and every woman that breastfed their baby can  
**[0:36:05-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:36:05):**  understand how strange it will be to take the baby away. I don't want to make cattle  into humans, but there's still something that is really important for cows to raise their  calves. Because we have dual-purpose cows, we are really beefy and we have a lot of milk.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:36:22):**  So it's really the calves grow perfectly and they are so fit. I just said to some customers,  we are born outside. We have seasonal calving, so we are born from mid of January to mid  of March and we are just the fittest cows I can imagine. We're just outside in the national  
**[0:36:41-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:36:41):**  park at the river. It's quite cold and rainy and windy. So we really have to have a good  fur for it. Yes, I'm happy with my system and I wish that every farmer has such healthy  cows. It's interesting because you've gone through  
**[0:36:59-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:36:59):**  so many different elements there, so many reasons for doing what you do, from better  welfare to better health and resilience in the animals, so hardier animals coming out  at the end of it, that presumably there's reduced medication, less medication that you're  
**[0:37:14-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:37:14):**  losing and easier management because the mothers are teaching the calves what to do and so  on. So that's really interesting because of course we always have this idea that you've  got to produce a certain amount of milk and that if you're losing any of it then that's  
**[0:37:32-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:37:32):**  a problem. But you're getting so much back in return for the milk that you're losing.  It's fascinating. And you also out winter your cattle, don't you? And I wonder, was  that easy or if you had to work really hard selecting for hardy characteristics?  
**[0:37:47-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:37:47):**  No, we get better every year, I notice it. We had in the first, when we bought the cows  eight years ago, we had three lung disease. But yeah, until then, from then on there was  nothing. We had a problem with flies, with pink eye. So I had Greg Trudy on my pasture  
**[0:38:08-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:38:08):**  from the US and he said, it's really, come on, continue this mop grazing and move them  faster so the flies don't reach them when they get out of the slurry or out of the manure.  This year it was so much better because I had to fight with my husband as well. And  
**[0:38:25-0:38:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:38:25):**  what is really important, Annabelle, you didn't mention it, it's very important for me to  invest in easier posts. Like we have metal posts and I had to use a hammer and now I  imported New Zealandish light posts and it's so much easier for me to just start the next.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:38:45):**  So it's getting easier. Like I can make my work easier as well. I don't need this manpower  and muscles so much.  Now you mentioned the flies there and of course that's a problem that most dairy farmers will  
**[0:38:57-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:38:57):**  be familiar with. But the way that you've resolved that is by moving them on basically  just faster than the flies hatch.  Yes.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:39:05):**  Yeah, very simple. Annabelle, one of the common themes that we found during the Regen dairy  project is that many farmers, I mean, no means all, but you know, a lot of them have turned  to regenerative agriculture in response to crisis. And it was, this was something that  
**[0:39:18-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:39:18):**  you were talking about yourself earlier, but having then discovered it, they couldn't be  happier. So if you were talking to a group of conventional dairy farmers now, and there,  you know, there will be farmers listening to this podcast who are in that sort of conventional  
**[0:39:30-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:39:30):**  mindset still, I'm sure. What would you say to them to persuade them to get off that treadmill,  to transition their farms before they encounter that crisis themselves?  That would be really a challenge for me. And to be honest, in reality, that would not happen  
**[0:39:47-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:39:47):**  because I'm too shy and I question me all the time. And I'm not enough self confident  for the task. And the problem is they are in another universe with a different set of  values. And mainly the yield counts. And to leave a reached level of yield is really hard.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:40:07):**  And to have fields that don't look like the neighbors is also very hard for farmers. It's  hard to be open minded if you have a system that is running. So why should you change  something? But what I could do is I could tell them our story of change from organic  
**[0:40:26-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:40:26):**  to regenerative mindset, and our working towards stability and resilience, and the importance  of soil health. And then I would try to set that in the context of all the planetary boundaries  we are facing. And then I would try to introduce them into the four ecosystem processes and  
**[0:40:48-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:40:48):**  how they could be used. Because if we use them best, we will stay inside the planetary  boundaries. And then I would focus on the farmers themselves, on the people and underline  the necessity to create a holistic context for themselves to ensure the management decisions  
**[0:41:06-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:41:06):**  they take are social, economical and ecological healthy. And that includes the own life quality  as well as the future resource base. That means the long term perspective of the farm,  let's say 100 years or 200 years. By this way, we could reach a sustainable dimension  
**[0:41:28-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:41:28):**  of agriculture.  Thank you. So within that, it was about being a happier person, a happier farmer, as well  as having more resilient land, more resilient business in the long term. Anja, what would  
**[0:41:38-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:41:38):**  you say if you were in that same position? What would you say to conventional farmers?  Yeah, it's always a big shift for them to just be on the pasture with the animals. When  I want to make it a real adventure, I take them to the bull pasture. We have 50 bulls  
**[0:41:54-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:41:54):**  on grassland. And we just like we think of bulls, you shouldn't use them because you  just use semen. It's so much easier. But when you use semen, where do you get it from? Do  you get it from farmers bred cows on cattle on grassland? Or did you get it from the US  
**[0:42:13-0:42:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:42:13):**  where the bull is not really born and has already a good breeding number? Like how crazy  is that? So I'm really, I think it's really good. And I feel more resilient to have it  in my own hands and exchange our genetics on farms that work regenerative, like we started  
**[0:42:32-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:42:32):**  now. I have also kindergarten groups and school and pupils on the pasture. And I think we  need to feel it. It's not something that can come in through their brain, maybe because  we were open and at me, we just watched it and we wanted to watch, to see something different.  
**[0:42:49-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:42:49):**  We wanted to find a solution. But we are just caught in their thinking. And I think through  feeling, oh, this could be my life as well, to get an idea of a new vision for them, how  animals can be kept, how animal husbandry can look like, how it can feel like, how easy  
**[0:43:08-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:43:08):**  it is. Maybe we love to drive the tractor all day, but maybe some don't. And we can  just see, oh yeah, the shit is just falling on this grassland here and the birds can eat  worms and yeah, our neighbors just mow the field and we can just look how our pasture  
**[0:43:25-0:43:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:43:25):**  looks and how our trampled pasture looks. Maybe they say, oh yeah, you should make it  more straight here. But then we can really come into a discussion. So I think it really  needs to step on my pasture to get to understand it or to watch some videos that could be a  
**[0:43:41-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:43:41):**  start as well. And maybe, Anabe, we have to start something in German because there's  not so much given on the video channels.  And of course, you know, you were talking before about the outwintering and the cow  
**[0:43:54-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:43:54):**  with calf and the way in which, you know, you're able to reduce those inputs while,  you know, maintaining the profit because you've got these hardier animals. Anabel, you said  that you don't think that any dairy system is sustainable unless it's regenerative. Now,  
**[0:44:10-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:44:10):**  we're nearing the end of the program, but if you could just summarize for us again,  why do you think that is?  We cannot look at food in a reductionist way anymore. The conventional agriculture is really  
**[0:44:23-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:44:23):**  successful in producing high amounts of food. But by the way, it also produces much external  costs and unintended consequences. I could not find enough answers in the common organic  regularities because my experience is the tendency is also a yield based system with  
**[0:44:43-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:44:43):**  less chemicals, but with a high technical input. Yeah, we failed with our management,  even it was organic at our place. So I think we need a real holistic approach to meet all  the needs of the planet and our needs and the needs of future generations. So we have  
**[0:45:04-0:45:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:45:04):**  to think from the soil to the plant, to the livestock, to the humans now and for the future  generations, we really have to deal with nature's complexity and we have to find ways to integrate  ourselves into this complexity. Otherwise we won't survive and the planet will. So we  
**[0:45:24-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:45:24):**  need to regenerate and to start at the soil, at the landscape, because it's the basis of  everything. Agriculture is really the basis for all human activities. So we have to regenerate  ourselves, we have to regenerate communities and we have to regenerate economies. And that  
**[0:45:43-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:45:43):**  will be the task for the next decades. And I think nothing else will be sustainable.  That's brilliant. Thank you. And Anja, finally, both you and Annabel are farming pioneers  in Germany. Very few people delivering Regen agriculture. So there's very little support  
**[0:46:01-0:46:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:46:01):**  for you and that must be really tough at times. So what is it that keeps you going?  It's always this knowledge exchange, like talking to you, being visited by Greg Judy,  we had a mob grazing on arable land conference where so many people came from all over Germany  
**[0:46:20-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:46:20):**  and we need more of that because this really gives the power when you're not feeling alone.  Like when you're a farmer, you often work on your fields with your animals. It's beautiful  to be out in the sun or in the rain or just whatever it is. But it's good to know there  
**[0:46:35-0:46:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:46:35):**  are more people thinking like me and we are fighting for the same values and we will do  it. We're not doing it. We have to be happy ourselves and we can get the work done, but  it's also good to know we can do it for a higher aim and to be in this network that  
**[0:46:53-0:47:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:46:53):**  really helps me to continue. And of course, you know, this network that  you're mentioning there, 20 years ago, before we all had the internet and podcasts and the  ability to talk through WhatsApp, that would have been a really difficult thing where now  
**[0:47:09-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:47:09):**  this regenerative dairy network that we've been working with and talking to over the  course of this project from the United States to New Zealand through the United Kingdom  and Germany in between, and I'm sure many other places, that there is this opportunity  
**[0:47:23-0:47:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:47:23):**  to learn from each other no matter where we are in the world. And that's a fantastic thing.  Look, thanks so much, both. That's been really interesting talking to you and thanks so much  for making the effort to speak in English, which is just fabulous and people will have  
**[0:47:38-0:47:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-future-of-dairy-e1tlf74#t=0:47:38):**  so enjoyed listening to what you've had to say. But that's all we've got time for.

### Farm Gate  (Tue, 05 Jul 2022 07:14:48)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Fenlow Kustain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:10):**  of the Food and Global Security Network. Often when we talk about shortening supply chains,  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:15):**  there are a set of unspoken assumptions and personal biases that frame the conversation.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:20):**  The idea of farmers selling direct to the public from their farm gate conjures, in my  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:24):**  mind at least, a semi-pastoral scene of happy people exchanging goods and payment. However,  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:30):**  most people live in cities, urban conurbations and housing estates rather than in cottages  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:35):**  next to farms and country footpaths. How can we shorten supply chains to reconnect people  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:40):**  who live in a world of concrete with the healthy soil that's used to produce their food? How  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:45):**  can we bring food production into cities themselves, utilising more rough ground, forgotten spaces  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:50):**  and parkland to support volunteers and micro business opportunities for urban citizens,  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:00:56):**  farmers and growers? I'm joined by Jeremy Isles from the Urban Agriculture Consortium  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:01):**  and Rachel Hammond from Edge. Welcome both. Perhaps we could start with an introduction  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:06):**  to your organisations and what they do. And Rachel, Edge is about designing and installing  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:11):**  edible and productive landscapes. What does that mean?  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:14):**  So we work with schools and local authorities, landscape architect and urban design practices  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:20):**  to design and install food producing landscapes essentially, but also with a focus on biodiversity.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:26):**  We can work with housing associations, working with residents, community consultations, looking  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:31):**  at how we can integrate food into a landscape. And then what we do is we tag on training.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:35):**  So we train people about how to produce food in an efficient way.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:38):**  So just help me out in terms of what you described there as a food producing landscape. In a  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:44):**  housing association setting, what would that look like? Where would that food be being  
**[0:01:49-0:01:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:49):**  produced? So often around blocks of flats or housing  
**[0:01:51-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:51):**  estates, there's often bits of greenery and shrubbery and often they're not producing.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:01:56):**  So it's thinking about turning that into something that's productive. So that might be purely  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:01):**  some black, red, white currant bushes instead of the standard cotoniasta that's usually specked  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:07):**  around buildings. But often it's things like raised beds or some kind of plot system where  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:12):**  residents get their own piece of land that they can work, such as an allotment, but maybe  
**[0:02:16-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:16):**  on a smaller scale. It could be some kind of orchard using the green space that's around  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:20):**  the building to produce food. Is that using sort of balconies and window  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:24):**  boxes and that sort of thing as well, or is that sort of outside the scope?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:27):**  Yeah, it certainly can be. We also talk about how we can use buildings better for producing  
**[0:02:32-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:32):**  food. So it's certainly looking at the inside and the outside together.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:36):**  And presumably there's a balance that needs to be struck between the food producing elements  
**[0:02:41-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:41):**  and the recreational elements so that there's places for people to relax and play at the  
**[0:02:45-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:45):**  same time as using land to produce the food. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we don't, we're  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:50):**  not suggesting that 100% of recreational ground is turned over to food, but a mix is certainly  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:55):**  a good idea and it engages different people. So whilst somebody might want to play football  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:02:59):**  or tennis, somebody else might want to be growing some vegetables or some herbs. So  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:02):**  it's a really nice way to bring people together around food and start that conversation and  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:07):**  just engage all ages. You know, it's really nice to kind of bring different age groups  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:11):**  together often, very young and older people can work really nicely on gardens. And that's  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:16):**  something that we've experienced in the past. Fantastic. Now you've worked closely with  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:20):**  Cultivate Oxford to create a strong local food system and a network of growers. And  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:25):**  you've said that you were inspired by living for several years in Todmorden, the birthplace  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:29):**  of incredible edible. What inspired you? Yeah, it was amazing to live there. I was there  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:34):**  for five years and involved in the project, growing food around the town. It's a small  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:39):**  town at the convergence of three valleys, you know, very difficult climatic conditions  
**[0:03:44-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:44):**  and landscape because you've got steep hills that are traditionally only sheep farmed.  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:48):**  But they've started growing food around around the town in raised beds, at trees, orchards,  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:52):**  etc. The high school now produces a lot of its own food and keeps chickens. You know,  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:03:57):**  I think integrating food and education in all of the schools is really inspiring because  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:01):**  you're getting people learning from a very young age about food production. But also  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:06):**  what I witnessed was a real impact on local economy. So not only was it producing what  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:11):**  they call vegetable tourists, people coming and visiting the town and therefore bringing  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:15):**  money and staying in B&Bs and visiting cafes and restaurants, but also local people setting  
**[0:04:20-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:20):**  up small food micro businesses. So I knew a couple of people that started keeping pigs  
**[0:04:24-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:24):**  up on the hilltops and then selling that meat through the meat stall at the market. Somebody  
**[0:04:29-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:29):**  started making ice cream from that using the honey from the bees that are kept in the churchyard,  
**[0:04:33-0:04:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:33):**  you know, so all of these kind of knock on effects and sort of ripples out, building  
**[0:04:37-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:37):**  economy around that town. And what's happened is that it's built an industry around food,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:42):**  you know, all of these knock on effects and different industries that have brought money  
**[0:04:46-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:46):**  and income and jobs to the town.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:49):**  Now, I don't want to put you on the spot, but do you have any sense of the population  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:52):**  of Tomoden, how big it is, and what proportion of that population would be involved in some  
**[0:04:57-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:57):**  form of growing of food?  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:04:59):**  Yeah, it's a good question. I know that the population was when I was there around 10,000.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:03):**  That may well have changed since then. That was about 10 years ago. In terms of the proportion,  
**[0:05:09-0:05:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:09):**  they do regular volunteering sessions. And I know that often they get 50 odd people turning  
**[0:05:14-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:14):**  out for a volunteer session, which is pretty good, certainly compared to a lot of the volunteering  
**[0:05:18-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:18):**  sessions that I've been involved in. In terms of the proportion, it would be a wild guess,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:23):**  but I would suggest maybe a good 20, 30% of the town are in some way involved because  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:29):**  they've just done such a cross spread. And if you include all the school children, obviously  
**[0:05:32-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:32):**  that statistic improves greatly because every school in the town has food now on their agenda.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:38):**  I think that's fascinating to hear about the number of people that are involved in the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:42):**  project in Tomoden, because even when people live in the countryside, it's easy to be disengaged  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:47):**  from the food production that's taking place all around you. So those are really quite  
**[0:05:52-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:52):**  remarkable figures in terms of engagement. That's really exciting to hear. Jeremy, you  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:05:57):**  coordinate the Urban Agriculture Consortium. What's your background and what's the consortium  
**[0:06:02-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:02):**  set up to achieve? Well, my background is a 40 year career in  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:06):**  the environmental sector, working for organisations like Friends of the Earth, Sustrans on cycling  
**[0:06:11-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:11):**  issues, London Wildlife Trust on urban wildlife issues. And then for 16 years, I was chief  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:16):**  exec of what was called the Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens. That's now  
**[0:06:21-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:21):**  called Social Farms and Gardens. In 2016, I left the job at the Fed, as it's called,  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:27):**  and sort of went independent and a colleague and myself said, look, we thought there's  
**[0:06:31-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:31):**  going to be a problem because of climate change in food resilience and the global supply system  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:36):**  of food. The consortium arose out of detailed consultations with a range of partners. I  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:43):**  went around the UK meeting local authority people. I also went around meeting people  
**[0:06:47-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:47):**  from local food partnerships. So if we take that as cross section, there's ourselves,  
**[0:06:52-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:52):**  we're called Green Future Associates, there's the Permaculture Association, the Community  
**[0:06:55-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:06:55):**  Supported Agriculture Network, Social Farms and Gardens, Open Food Network, and at a very  
**[0:07:01-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:01):**  local scale, an organisation in Sheffield called ReGather, who are in themselves a cooperative  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:06):**  growing, delivering food and through shops and stuff. I would say that from my work experience,  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:11):**  the consortium is a fairly unusual and unique way of working. It's pretty innovative. It's  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:16):**  very fleet of foot, no bureaucracy. We have a management committee, which is actually  
**[0:07:20-0:07:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:20):**  called an oversight group. We meet about every two or three months remotely. But what it's  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:25):**  enabled, and this is brilliant, it's enabled local organisations that have felt that they're  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:30):**  working in isolation to tag on to something, a new momentum at a national level. They can  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:36):**  say, and in Leeds, for example, the Leeds Food Partnership were able to say to the city  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:41):**  council, listen up, we're belonging to the Urban Agriculture Consortium, there's a bit  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:46):**  of a momentum growing here, why don't you come along and have a meeting. So this has  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:49):**  all been done remotely. And I would just go back a little second. We started this in 2016.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:55):**  Since then, we know what's happened. We've had COVID, we've had climate crisis being  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:07:59):**  sort of like exponentially recognised as well as being exponentially more disastrous. And  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:04):**  of course now we've had the invasion of Ukraine, which has all highlighted the instability  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:10):**  and insecurity of the global food system. So more and more people at a local level,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:15):**  at a community level and now at a local authority level, this is really critical, are beginning  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:21):**  to realise that local resilience is really important. And most of them have not got food  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:28):**  on their agendas. They might have transport on their agendas, they've got economics on  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:31):**  their agendas, they've got education, blah, blah, blah, but they don't have food.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:35):**  And of course, food will come into each of those things that you've just mentioned.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:39):**  Indeed. So what we're finding, and this is really interesting, probably in the last 12  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:44):**  months, we've only been running the programme really since 2020. So we're only two years  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:48):**  in. When we started, we started in five northern cities, we didn't have any local authority  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:53):**  representation. Those partner organisations did, but they weren't brought in. We now had,  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:08:59):**  for example, a meeting just this week in the Midlands, East Midlands, it was on Zoom. But  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:03):**  of the eight people who took part, two were from local authorities. One was from Nottingham  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:08):** shire County Council, and one was from Birmingham City Council. Birmingham is the second largest  
**[0:09:14-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:14):**  city authority in the UK. So have Birmingham City Council sitting in a meeting going, my  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:18):**  God, this is exciting, you know, actually is really brilliant. Nottinghamshire, and  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:23):**  this is all coming through the Public Health Channel, are about to commission some work  
**[0:09:27-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:27):**  on the feasibility of setting up new farm businesses in Nottinghamshire County. Now,  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:33):**  that wouldn't have happened a year ago. And it's to do with the conjunction of all these  
**[0:09:37-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:37):**  crises raising awareness of the issues around immediate food insecurity, and actually talking  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:43):**  about public health and resilience. When we've spoken before, you've talked to me about the  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:48):**  idea that 15% of food could be produced in the city for people in the city. Where would  
**[0:09:54-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:09:54):**  that be produced and by whom? Most towns and cities already have quite a lot of food production  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:00):**  going on. There's allotments, there's people's back gardens, there's already community gardens  
**[0:10:04-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:04):**  and city farms, and there will be some micro businesses already out there. The initial  
**[0:10:08-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:08):**  figure of 15% came from a report that was written in Bristol about 10-12 years ago now,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:13):**  and it was called Who Feeds Bristol? And that research was done by a very prominent local  
**[0:10:18-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:18):**  food systems campaigner, a colleague of ours, Joy Carey, and she analysed where the Bristol  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:22):**  food came from and what the potential was. And that figure of 15% came from there. That's  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:27):**  if the City Council and the other institutions that have land, which could be the NHS, could  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:32):**  be universities, it could be schools and businesses, if the land was made available at some scale,  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:38):**  that 15% could be achieved. That figure was echoed in a study that was done by Jill Edmondson  
**[0:10:45-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:45):**  at Sheffield University, and she analysed what green space there was within the city  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:49):**  bounds of Sheffield. And she said, if all the vacant space was made available and was  
**[0:10:54-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:10:54):**  turned into productive growing spaces, whatever they may be, that figure of 15% could be achieved.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:11:00):**  Now what you've got to remember, and Rachel alluded to this in reference to Tob  
**[0:11:21-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:11:21):**  you can grow 15% of everything everywhere, but as an overall parameter, you could say  
**[0:11:47-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:11:47):**  there was only a 50% return of food at Sheffield and needed a little bit of awhile to get from  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:05):**  the city to have as much green as they could.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:09):**  Paul  
**[0:12:03-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:03):**  I guess the thing about for us, and this actually is the close of the mind ofWW right now on  
**[0:12:16-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:16):**  percent of the fruit that's used by the city is remarkable.  
**[0:12:20-0:12:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:20):**  Yeah, it's really exciting. And I specifically included only public space, so no private  
**[0:12:25-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:25):**  gardens or kind of closed sites. So I included schools within that. And of course, each school  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:30):**  will be slightly different, but I was quite conservative with those estimates of the area.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:35):**  And then a section of each, so I plotted all the public parks and green spaces around the  
**[0:12:39-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:39):**  city. So this is all within the ring road of Oxford and took a portion of that to become  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:44):**  a public edible forest garden that was designed specifically to produce top fruit and nuts  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:50):**  to have birds undergrazing, so for egg production. And then each of the rows of trees were underplanted  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:12:56):**  with fruit bushes and nitrogen fixing shrubs. And that design creates a row, the underplanting  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:03):**  was designed to be two rows per month of the year so that people can kind of go up and  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:07):**  down and pick it a bit like a pick your own or a supermarket. So each aisle was kind of  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:12):**  a month's worth. And then obviously with the birds, you've got egg production and you can  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:15):**  incorporate these for honey. And then you could choose to include biodomes if that's  
**[0:13:20-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:20):**  a sort of optional extra to increase production of things like mushrooms, herbs, edible flowers,  
**[0:13:25-0:13:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:25):**  and more of the tropical fruits that we import, so citrus and other fruits that don't naturally  
**[0:13:29-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:29):**  grow here.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:30):**  Rachel, key to your approach is the idea that urban spaces, particularly publicly owned  
**[0:13:35-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:35):**  urban spaces, from schools and hospital grounds to other publicly owned land could be opened  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:41):**  up not only for voluntary food production, as you know, we'll quite often see, especially,  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:46):**  you know, those of us that have kids in school, there are bits of the school field that have  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:50):**  been given over to growing some stuff, particularly for educational purposes, but instead for  
**[0:13:55-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:55):**  the creation of micro farm businesses. So actually having these smaller businesses running  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:00):**  on that land, what really do you have in mind?  
**[0:14:02-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:02):**  Rachel  
**[0:13:59-0:14:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:13:59):**  Part of our ethos and the way that we run our practices is definitely about producing  
**[0:14:08-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:08):**  more growers and encouraging small food business. And that could be anything from the use of  
**[0:14:13-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:13):**  urban buildings, so using balconies, rooftops, living walls, green roofs, to use the buildings  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:20):**  for producing food. Also the green spaces, wetlands, schools, and what we're talking  
**[0:14:25-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:25):**  about really is fruit, nuts, veg, herbs, edible flowers, and potentially eggs if you can undergrazed  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:31):**  trees with birds. I'll give you an example. There's a business in Oxford which harvests  
**[0:14:36-0:14:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:36):**  fruit from public trees, which are otherwise, you know, the fruit goes to waste, and that's  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:41):**  juiced and then the juice is sold at a farmer's market. So that's a really good example of  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:46):**  a small local business that takes advantage of a currently raised product. But that could  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:50):**  be anything from somebody that has an orchard deciding then to undergrazed it with birds  
**[0:14:54-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:14:54):**  and selling the eggs. It could be a small local beekeeper that starts to keep beehives  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:00):**  on, you know, community buildings or local buildings on rooftops or in gardens. It doesn't  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:06):**  have to be on a grand scale, but what you end up with is this patchwork of small local  
**[0:15:10-0:15:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:10):**  producers that all feed the produce into local food system. And so the idea is that with  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:15):**  a number of local food producers, you can then feed that urban environment, and then  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:20):**  it's replicated in the next urban environment. So whilst there's some exchange of produce,  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:24):**  because as Jeremy says, you know, you can't produce everything everywhere in the country,  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:28):**  so you're going to have regional variances. But actually, you link all of that up and  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:32):**  there's exchange of produce as well as producing enough locally.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:35):**  I'm fascinated by the idea because I think, and perhaps, you know, do correct me if I'm  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:39):**  wrong, but the impression I get is that an awful lot of the food production that's going  
**[0:15:44-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:44):**  on in cities, standardly across the UK, for example, is voluntary, you know, as people  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:50):**  on allotments. And so the idea of actually creating micro businesses while there are  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:53):**  some already there, actually, that's quite a step change.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:15:57):**  Yeah, it is. And I think part of the problem where we've ended up is that a lot of this  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:02):**  is reliant on volunteer labour. And I mean, incredible edible Todmorden, and most incredible  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:06):**  edibles are a prime example of that, you know, we started out as an incredible edible Oxford,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:11):**  we've, we've transitioned, we're still not for profit, we do do some voluntary work,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:14):**  but we've tried to make it a sustainable business related to food. And, you know, I think that's  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:19):**  really important to try and switch that away from volunteering. And actually, if you think  
**[0:16:25-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:25):**  about how landscapes maintained, you know, you've got local authorities that go out and  
**[0:16:29-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:29):**  mow lawns on verges 40 times a year, or whatever it is, you've got parks and gardens teams  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:35):**  that maintain shrubbery, there's no reason why that couldn't be maintaining food. Part  
**[0:16:39-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:39):**  of the issue is when you say edible landscape, people imagine, you know, rows of carrots  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:43):**  or something like that. We're not really talking about that what we're talking about is kind  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:47):**  of orchards, forest gardens, where you've got trees, shrubs, underplanting, it's a layered  
**[0:16:52-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:52):**  system, it's minimal maintenance, you don't get a lot of weeding that you have to do,  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:56):**  you don't then have to mow, but you get really high produce.  
**[0:16:59-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:16:59):**  One of the farmers that we've spoken to previously on the podcast has managed to speak to other  
**[0:17:26-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:17:26):**  locals who have a global desktop community that rather thanocusing at microgrid, not  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:17:35):**  trace that you can still talk about these tall mushroom trees, but I guess that could  
**[0:17:41-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:17:41):**  keep people investing to make a good family.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:17:42):**  So it's interesting to refer to this kind of landscape thinking about Cameron and the  
**[0:17:45-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:17:45):**  treebie way it really is. I thought it was really interesting to get part of. Like, you  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:17:50):**  say you know, schools gotta have places to collect food for the natural environment,  
**[0:17:55-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:17:55):**  of hospital grounds and school fields being used for businesses to be run from. I wonder  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:02):**  if you've had conversations with hospital administrators or head teachers about this  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:07):**  sort of thing and what their response has been?  
**[0:18:10-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:10):**  Hannah  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:09):**  Mixed, as always. Of course, there are some interested people and often it's driven by  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:15):**  one passionate person. And unfortunately, if that person leaves, then you're kind of  
**[0:18:19-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:19):**  left with something hanging in the balance. And that's happened quite a lot in our time.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:23):**  But also there are policies, you know, that sometimes actually prevent rather than not  
**[0:18:27-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:27):**  encouraging actually preventing food production. So I can't give you the name of it. But there  
**[0:18:32-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:32):**  is a policy around at schools where it prevents the growing of food in what should be recreational  
**[0:18:37-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:37):**  area. So you know, there are barriers in policy, whilst we don't have anything that really  
**[0:18:42-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:42):**  supports food production at the moment. Although I wanted to mention the Right to Grow campaign,  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:47):**  which is an incredible campaign for at the moment, which is exactly that about local  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:51):**  authorities passing over land for food production. There are things happening, but there are  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:18:55):**  also policies working against us, which doesn't help, of course. And it needs somebody passionate  
**[0:19:00-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:00):**  to drive that. And then of course, you've got the budget as a barrier as well, because  
**[0:19:03-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:03):**  we talked to many schools, and we've worked with many different schools, and then finding  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:07):**  budget to actually get this into action is often a barrier.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:10):**  Toby  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:10):**  And of course, if you're hoping to get micro businesses operational on that site, then  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:16):**  they're going to need to have the confidence that that land is going to be available to  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:19):**  them for a number of years rather than them for a single season. And if that relies on  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:24):**  the motivation of a single individual, then that's always going to be difficult. So perhaps  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:30):**  there is a need for central government to step in at this point and start engaging with  
**[0:19:35-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:35):**  this and directing local councils to take a different approach. And it strikes me that  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:40):**  that's something perhaps that the Urban Agriculture Consortium would be able to help with, Jeremy.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:45):**  Jeremy  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:46):**  One of the things I'd like to comment on here that we could talk for a long time, just talking  
**[0:19:50-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:50):**  about the use of land in anchor institutions, let's talk about hospitals and doctor surgeries.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:19:57):**  Now going back to Todmaden, which is a great example, they had a real battle with the local  
**[0:20:02-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:02):**  GP surgery, who had a modern building surrounded by a car park. Now, this is psychological.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:09):**  Schools are surrounded by car parks, hospitals are surrounded by car parks, everywhere surrounded  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:13):**  by car parks. Now, if you have that as your primary objective, we have to drive to work  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:19):**  because we live too far away from our workplace. We have to have a car parking space. That's  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:23):**  more important psychologically than anything else to those people. That is an indictment  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:28):**  of our whole system that we've allowed ourselves to be channeled in this particular direction.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:34):**  So what they did in Todmaden is they went to the GP surgery and said, why can't we plant  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:37):**  some edible plants outside the surgery? Wouldn't that send a good message? So that's a psychological  
**[0:20:42-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:42):**  change that's got to take place everywhere.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:44):**  For improving health and wellbeing quite apart from anything else.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:47):**  And just to say to people, you don't have to drive to a supermarket to get food. It's  
**[0:20:51-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:51):**  all around you. So going back to what you're saying, there's a couple of very interesting  
**[0:20:55-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:20:55):**  policy initiatives. One's called the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, which was created  
**[0:21:00-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:00):**  in about 2015, 2016, and cities all over the world are signing up to that. On top of that,  
**[0:21:06-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:06):**  there's a Sustainable Food Places criteria for how you go through their system of accreditation,  
**[0:21:11-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:11):**  which is run by the Soil Association. But then in COP26 in Glasgow, our partners in  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:15):**  an organisation called Nourish in Scotland worked really hard to create something called  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:20):**  the Glasgow Food and Climate Declaration. Those are not government policy levels. The  
**[0:21:25-0:21:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:25):**  Milan Urban Food Policy Pact is run by the Metropolitan Authority in Milan, and it is  
**[0:21:30-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:30):**  asking local authorities to sign up. The Glasgow Food Declaration is asking local city regions  
**[0:21:37-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:37):**  to sign up. Now their take is that it's a city region policy strategic level that will  
**[0:21:42-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:42):**  make the change, not national government. So we're working, as I said earlier, we were  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:47):**  talking to lots of places about the barriers that they're facing, and they all said we  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:51):**  can't engage with local politics. How do we do it? It's very confrontational. It's very  
**[0:21:56-0:22:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:21:56):**  a bit of their risk averse. So we've set up something called the Policy Influencers Network  
**[0:22:00-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:00):**  group or the PING, and that is an online forum for anybody from a food partnership and or  
**[0:22:07-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:07):**  a local authority and or universities and or, you know, anyone really can come along.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:12):**  And it's an open discussion forum. It's not come along and beat up your local authority  
**[0:22:16-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:16):**  officer. It's how do we unlock the barriers to local food production? Now, when we started  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:21):**  the PING…  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:22):**  Jason Vale And presumably, sorry to interrupt, but presumably  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:24):**  it's how do we empower those individuals who are within local authorities who want  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:29):**  to make progress but are finding stumbling blocks themselves as local authority staff?  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:34):**  How do we empower them to be able to make the change?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:36):**  Ian Marber Exactly. So what we've done when we started  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:38):**  the PING last year, with the first meeting, we had about 30 people in no local authority  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:43):**  offices. The most recent one we had 45 people of which 20% were or 25% were from local authorities  
**[0:22:50-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:50):**  across the UK, right from Scotland, Wales, right down to the south west of England. Now,  
**[0:22:55-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:55):**  that's by sitting in the same space, they'd never be able to do it physically, they'd  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:22:59):**  never get permission to travel. Creating that on Zoom means that anybody from anywhere can  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:03):**  give up an hour of their day and sit in a meeting. They make connections not only with  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:07):**  local people from their local food communities, but they also make connections with other  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:10):**  local authority officers who are trying their best to circumvent all the barriers. That  
**[0:23:15-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:15):**  is priceless. So we've had in the last couple of meetings, we had the chief planner of Leeds  
**[0:23:20-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:20):**  City Council talking about what they're trying to do to unlock the potential through by working  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:26):**  around the planning system. And the last meeting, we had a public health officer from Sheffield  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:30):**  City Council talking about how councillors put through a right to food motion in the  
**[0:23:35-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:35):**  City Council, but tagged on to the bottom of it was the stated aim of increasing urban  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:42):**  food production and protecting urban green space for local food production. Now that  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:47):**  is beginning to turn the tide. Going back to Rachel talking about how do you encourage  
**[0:23:51-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:51):**  new entrants into this very difficult place. There are a number of farm starts as we call  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:23:58):**  them, and we're working closely with another agency, the Land Workers Alliance, to actually  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:02):**  develop a training package for farm starters. Through our work, and I give all credit to  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:08):**  Land Workers Alliance, this is their baby really, through that work, we've now got five  
**[0:24:12-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:12):**  organisations in the north of England looking to start up farm starts. What they're finding  
**[0:24:17-0:24:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:17):**  is let's just do it. We'll try and negotiate for land with the local authority, but let's  
**[0:24:21-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:21):**  just get on and do something practical on the ground.  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:24):**  Rich Let me come back to you just in terms of this  
**[0:24:27-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:27):**  vision of micro businesses on publicly owned land. And I wonder if you're aware of other  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:32):**  key barriers that are in place in terms of making this vision a reality and what your  
**[0:24:37-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:37):**  approach is to unlocking land availability. Rachel  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:40):**  Yeah, so we've talked about policies a lot. Other barriers that we see are access to skills.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:46):**  So somebody might not necessarily know how to grow food in the most productive way. And  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:50):**  of course, access to land. Now, similarly to what Jeremy just mentioned, we've got a  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:24:55):**  food growers programme, which we run on land within the city, which gives people access  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:01):**  to our training on growing food and starting a micro food business, as well as them having  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:06):**  access to a plot of land which they can use them to grow food. And then we have links  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:10):**  with other organisations who have surplus land in inverted commas, which is currently  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:15):**  costing them money to manage that those learners can then in a successional programme, then  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:21):**  go on to farm or manage to produce food that then enters the local food system. So we've  
**[0:25:26-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:26):**  developed that programme specifically to teach people all the key skills about growing food  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:31):**  and then having access to land. And so that's really important within a city. And of course,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:36):**  that's then replicable wherever that wanted to take place. What's really important is  
**[0:25:39-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:39):**  producing these growers who can grow food with care to the soil, with care to the environment  
**[0:25:45-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:45):**  and producing really good quality produce that then enters the local food system.  
**[0:25:49-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:25:49):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:26:06-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:26:06):**  Territory  
**[0:26:36-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:26:36):**  so vulnerable with our current food system that actually by producing more locally, you're  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:26:41):**  producing not only kind of personal resilience in terms of people earning an income, but  
**[0:26:45-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:26:45):**  also that urban environment, whatever that is, is creating its own resilience, both economically  
**[0:26:51-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:26:51):**  because people are in work and being paid for produce, but you are creating a value  
**[0:26:55-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:26:55):**  around local food. And that's exactly what's been demonstrated in Togmeden.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:26:58):**  Jeremy, the challenge here is in creating meaningful opportunities for people to get  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:03):**  out and start producing food. And a lot of that comes back to the availability of land  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:08):**  and who owns that land. You have a proposal, I think, that would help to unblock that particular  
**[0:27:14-0:27:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:14):**  challenge.  
**[0:27:15-0:27:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:15):**  Jeremy  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:30):**  at City Farms, we set up something called the Community Land Advisory Service. And the  
**[0:27:33-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:33):**  point of that was to create models of occupational lease models that we could give to the local  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:40):**  people who wanted land to say, look, you can produce this, an agreement with a landowner,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:44):**  which guarantees them this, this and this. And this is, these are the terms of reference.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:48):**  But what you, as you said, quite rightly earlier on, you have to have 25 years access or five  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:52):**  years, you know, you can't do it growing in a year, you've got to have a long term thing.  
**[0:27:57-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:27:57):**  Community Land Advisory Service is still running a little bit in Wales, but they've sort of  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:00):**  run out of money. But one of the newer ideas that's coming up our agenda, and we're trying  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:04):**  to get some money to try it out is to use community land trusts to take land into common  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:11):**  ownership, if you like, and common management. Now, community land trusts, not something  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:14):**  I know a lot about, because it's predominantly about housing, but this is tried and tested  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:19):**  model, which local authorities, local communities can use to take land from a local authority  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:24):**  portfolio and manage it for community good. Now, we're testing out with Bristol Community  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:29):**  Land Trust, the idea of that land trust also taking land for community food and their enterprise  
**[0:28:35-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:35):**  food growing. We haven't got very far, but I'd say it's got some resonance and it's got  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:40):**  some traction with the local authority. And we're also beginning to talk to the West of  
**[0:28:44-0:28:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:44):**  England Combined Authority, which is four metropolitan authorities. And seeing if that  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:49):**  model might be something that we can prototype, if you like, in and around Bristol. Bristol  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:54):**  City Council itself has quite an interesting policy called the One City Plan. And that  
**[0:28:59-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:28:59):**  has, as a stated objective, to create food growing opportunities in every council ward  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:05):**  across the city. So it's not just in one place, it's everywhere. And going back to how this  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:10):**  patchwork of projects and produce might develop, Bristol is a great example. It's quite a big  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:15):**  city for 500,000 people. And then right in the middle of city, you've got a very dense  
**[0:29:20-0:29:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:20):**  urban area, but you've got a park with a demonstration plot, actually built by, not by incredible,  
**[0:29:25-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:25):**  but actually built by the City Council Allotment Officer right in the middle of the city so  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:29):**  people can take produce from there. Going outwards, you've got a couple of city farms  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:33):**  within dense urban population areas, lots of allotments left over, well started probably  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:38):**  around the First World War. Going outwards, you've got various micro businesses, there's  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:43):**  one called Purple Pact, which does a veg box scheme. Going a bit further out, you've got  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:46):**  a project called Sims Hill and another one called Grow Wilder now. So it's a sort of  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:50):**  biodiversity nature reserve, but with food growing. So it sort of crosses over all the  
**[0:29:54-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:29:54):**  borders. If we could imagine what cities were like in, like 100 years ago, 1940s, all cities  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:01):**  were surrounded by market gardens, which fed directly into the city. And that's, in a sense,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:06):**  all we need to do is re-replicate, recreate that, but using very efficient, modern regenerative  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:12):**  techniques, so sustainable growing, which actually regenerates the quality of the soil  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:16):**  rather than depleting it.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:17):**  Jason Vale, Head of the City of London, and of course, you know, through things like the  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:19):**  Policy Influencers Network Group, even if there's a struggle in one particular part  
**[0:30:23-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:23):**  of the country to initiate a particular project, because there is this network and this sharing  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:29):**  of peer-to-peer information, it allows people to learn from each other to de-risk those  
**[0:30:34-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:34):**  challenges. It's a slow process to start, but actually will gain its own momentum, hopefully  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:39):**  over time, so that these things start to flourish at some point and pop up all over the country.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:44):**  Ian Marber, Head of the City of London, and of course, I very much hope so. I mentioned  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:46):**  earlier on, I used to work to promote cycling. You could say, well, I remember very clearly  
**[0:30:51-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:51):**  talking at an event in Cardiff years ago and saying, you know, it's like turning the super  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:55):**  tank around. It takes two miles to slow the thing down, and then you've got to nudge it  
**[0:30:58-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:30:58):**  around a corner. Well, this, the whole economic system that we're working in has been established  
**[0:31:02-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:02):**  in since the 1950s and 1960s, the whole consumer paradigm, as it's called, and it's falling  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:08):**  apart quite clearly in front of our eyes. It's not fit for purpose. It's leaving people  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:13):**  without enough food to eat, even though they're working. You know, there's something pretty  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:16):**  fundamentally wrong. Trying to patch it up is not going to help. So what we've got to  
**[0:31:20-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:20):**  do is have a new mindset. Now, the analogy with cycling is 40 years ago, people thought  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:26):**  you were mad to try and promote cycling in an urban area. Now, the trajectory is that  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:30):**  everywhere will have to accommodate cycling and at the expense of the private car. In  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:35):**  our arena, this whole notion of breaking out of the global supply system and the supermarket  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:40):**  domination of our lives is going to take a long time. If you like, we're pioneering a  
**[0:31:45-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:45):**  system that hopefully will be in place in 20 years from now.  
**[0:31:47-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:47):**  So let's go into that mindset change. And mindset change is something we frequently  
**[0:31:51-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:51):**  talk about on this programme. But in this case, it's about urban landowners and local  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:31:57):**  government valuing the opportunities that urban food production brings. Now, we're familiar  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:03):**  with the idea of natural capital, but being involved in a food producing community in  
**[0:32:07-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:07):**  an urban area presumably creates social capital as well. And we've talked about some of this  
**[0:32:12-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:12):**  already in the programme, but there's a value which presumably can be calculated both in  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:17):**  terms of providing better nutrition, but also improved wellbeing, social integration and  
**[0:32:23-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:23):**  skills creation. So how do you go about demonstrating the social capital benefits to increase support  
**[0:32:29-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:29):**  of organisations like local authorities?  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:31):**  One of the fundamental problems that we have is that everything has to be capitalised and  
**[0:32:36-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:36):**  justified in terms of economic return. Whereas I'd say it's pretty obvious if you have a  
**[0:32:42-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:42):**  community project which engages people who take pride in their local area, who get to  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:46):**  meet people who do physical exercise outside whilst growing food and learning about natural  
**[0:32:51-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:51):**  environment, it's obvious it's got a lot of social benefits. But if you want to go really  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:55):**  technical, you can do something called a social return on investment, which is a very long-winded  
**[0:32:59-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:32:59):**  economic analysis of how much, if you put a pound in, how much do you get back? And  
**[0:33:03-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:03):**  if I remember rightly, the only one I can remember we did was one with Gorgie City Farm  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:08):**  in Edinburgh years ago, and it turned out the ratio was something like seven to one.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:13):**  So that for every pound you put in, you've got seven pounds worth of value back. But,  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:17):**  and this is important, going back to, you just mentioned the nutrition of food, the  
**[0:33:21-0:33:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:21):**  interface between recognition of a need to improve resilience between planning departments  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:28):**  and public health departments in local authorities is the crucial place, I think. Because public  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:33):**  health can legitimately get involved in talking about food and public health wellbeing. That's  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:40):**  the slightly ajar door that we think we can start pushing out.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:44):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:36):**  And of course, what we were talking about earlier with Rachel around that, the reduction  
**[0:33:48-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:48):**  of maintenance costs, because people are actively managing that land for their own micro businesses.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:54):**  You know, there are ways of quantifying the money that's saved in order to perhaps inspire  
**[0:33:59-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:33:59):**  these cash strap councils to take more of an interest as well. So that's really interesting.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:04):**  There is this sort of combination of being able to start to define costs that have been  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:09):**  removed, our social capital, as well as that natural capital creation. And all of this  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:14):**  goes towards making the case for more land being used for food production in city areas  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:19):**  and urban areas. Rachel, one of the areas that we haven't yet touched on, but which  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:24):**  a lot of people will think about in terms of urban food is the value of high tech solutions.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:29):**  So turning over subways, warehouses, and old power stations to high tech systems like hydroponics.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:35):**  What role do you think high tech urban food should play?  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:39):**  Rachel Smith,  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:40):**  For me, it's last resort because we need to be thinking about reducing our carbon footprint,  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:44):**  not thinking about new ways to use extra power and extra water and resources to create food.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:49):**  All of these sort of case studies and research have proven that it's entirely possible to  
**[0:34:54-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:34:54):**  use building rooftops, urban spaces, you know, stocking, growing, etc, to produce more than  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:01):**  enough food in, you know, in natural outdoors conditions, you know, where there's real sunlight.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:07):**  I think if all of that is done, and we still can't produce enough food, then yeah, maybe  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:11):**  consider it. But for me, it's absolutely last resort, because we can feed a population with  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:16):**  efficient design and good land use.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:18):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:19):**  Is there anything wrong with doing systems like hydroponics alongside the kind of food  
**[0:35:24-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:24):**  production that you're interested in?  
**[0:35:26-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:26):**  Rachel Smith  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:27):**  There's nothing wrong with it. It just uses a lot of energy and it's not very natural,  
**[0:35:30-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:30):**  you know, it's often not with natural sunlight. So then you're bringing in UV lights or whatever  
**[0:35:35-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:35):**  you need to kind of keep the plants alive. You're having to use a lot of water because  
**[0:35:39-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:39):**  you're having to cycle water inside a building because you've got no access to rainfall.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:43):**  It's just moving food another step away from, you know, we're already disconnected from  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:47):**  our food. But then if we start producing food in white suits in a building, it's not, in  
**[0:35:52-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:52):**  my opinion, really solving that problem of being connected to our food because you're  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:35:56):**  not outside getting vitamin D hands in the soil. You know, it's not really giving us  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:01):**  any of the benefits that we're talking about here with food production.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:04):**  Jason Vale  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:05):**  But of course, these sorts of projects are attractive to investors and to corporations.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:11):**  And Jeremy, I wonder why you think it is that there's so much more investment that's centred  
**[0:36:16-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:16):**  around high tech, urban food factories than around good community projects, micro businesses  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:23):**  with high social and natural capital delivery.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:25):**  Jeremy  
**[0:36:42-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:42):**  I was making profits out of installing the systems. I did visit a very expensive hydroponic  
**[0:36:47-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:47):**  plant in Berlin a few years ago, when we went to an international conference, but back in  
**[0:36:52-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:52):**  the days that you did that sort of thing. And that was a million and a half euros of  
**[0:36:56-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:36:56):**  investments and they were going to produce X numbers of plants and X numbers of different  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:00):**  varieties of fish. It very quickly run out of steam and was producing one sort of fish  
**[0:37:06-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:06):**  and losing loads of basil, probably more basil than Berlin needed. But here we go. However,  
**[0:37:10-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:10):**  having said that, there is a space for what we would call assisted growing and poly tunnels  
**[0:37:15-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:15):**  and greenhouses are part of a traditional growing system. And that is quite sensible  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:20):**  things to have. And particularly the further north you go, it gets colder. And there are  
**[0:37:24-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:24):**  systems in place where you can take heat from a neighbourhood heating system and feed that  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:31):**  into heating greenhouses. So there are elements of tech which should be harnessed and should  
**[0:37:37-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:37):**  be used. But big business is always seeking ways to make the next bit of profit. They're  
**[0:37:43-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:43):**  not interested in social capital and they're not interested in community welfare.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:47):**  Rachel, Starbucks is essentially a coffee shop. It's a coffee shop which has been replicated  
**[0:37:53-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:53):**  and replicated and replicated. I wonder if you think that there are opportunities for  
**[0:37:57-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:37:57):**  investors to invest in the sort of systems that you're talking about, to scale a micro  
**[0:38:04-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:04):**  business so that you have a patchwork of these micro enterprises that are creating profit  
**[0:38:11-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:11):**  for investors as well as the people who are working and growing in those environments.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:17):**  Yeah, without a doubt. I mean, you've got the training elements, you know, where you  
**[0:38:21-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:21):**  can have people coming through your door that are learning how to grow food in an efficient  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:25):**  way. You've got surplus produce that is then entering the food system and being sold. You've  
**[0:38:31-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:31):**  got access to land. You know, if people like we've been talking about people renting essentially  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:36):**  land off the local authority, there's no reason why that couldn't be a private landowner instead.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:42):**  So there are multiple ways that other people can get involved and support that and to sort  
**[0:38:46-0:38:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:46):**  of monetise, dirty word, what we're talking about.  
**[0:38:49-0:38:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:49):**  But investment and return is going to be an important part of upscaling the sort of thing  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:54):**  that we're talking about, isn't it? Sure. But I mean, you know, we used to create  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:38:58):**  all of our own or gather all of our own food. So, you know, our food systems just moved  
**[0:39:02-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:02):**  so far away. And I guess that's why I say it's a bit of a dirty word, because we should  
**[0:39:06-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:06):**  all have the right of access to fresh and healthy food, which is what we had, you know,  
**[0:39:11-0:39:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:11):**  hundreds, thousands of years ago, because we were all responsible for our own food.  
**[0:39:15-0:39:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:15):**  And that power has kind of been taken away from us to people that want to just make money  
**[0:39:19-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:19):**  from serving us our food. So it's kind of a lot about taking back a lot of that power  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:24):**  and resilience. I mean, I don't want to make it really this particular point about politics,  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:28):**  but it is important. And, you know, we should all have some right to grow our own food,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:33):**  whether that's to sell for an extra income or just for our own household, you know, and  
**[0:39:38-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:38):**  a lot of people don't have that. And of course, in the old days, most people  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:41):**  were growing at least some spuds, you know, in their gardens and that sort of thing. So  
**[0:39:45-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:45):**  it's getting back to that idea that we take some personal responsibility for the food  
**[0:39:49-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:49):**  that we're consuming, at the same time as allowing as much space as possible to be given  
**[0:39:54-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:39:54):**  over to, whether it's volunteer groups or micro businesses or indeed, you know, larger  
**[0:40:00-0:40:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:00):**  patchworks of businesses that have larger investment models.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:03):**  We're coming towards the end of the programme, Jeremy, and I wonder if you were to pick out  
**[0:40:07-0:40:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:07):**  one UK project that you think really exemplifies what you and the Urban Agriculture Consortium  
**[0:40:14-0:40:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:14):**  are trying to achieve. What would it be? Jeremy Carr- And I would say that I don't  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:18):**  want to pick out a project because that's a bit sort of unfair on others, but I think  
**[0:40:23-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:23):**  a generic model of a farm starts taking on land which is maybe split between two sites,  
**[0:40:29-0:40:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:29):**  perhaps an inner city site and a peri-urban site. So you've got an inner city demonstration  
**[0:40:33-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:33):**  project that could be an existing city farm or a new one using some volunteer community  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:38):**  engagement, some community investment. We haven't mentioned share offers, you know,  
**[0:40:43-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:43):**  community share offers are a good idea or veg box schemes, community supported agriculture  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:47):**  type model. Taking volunteers, providing skills training, providing an income for one or  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:52):**  two head growers, because you do need somebody to actually manage these things. But then  
**[0:40:57-0:41:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:40:57):**  actually having investment from the local authority and actually that model being recognised  
**[0:41:02-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:02):**  by the local authority of value to its well being across the piece. So that generic sort  
**[0:41:08-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:08):**  of model of patchwork farming, incorporating lots of existing parts of this growing system,  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:15):**  including allotments, including community gardens, including all the schools, but it  
**[0:41:18-0:41:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:18):**  being seen as part of a continuous growing landscape. So I think that farm start model,  
**[0:41:24-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:24):**  plus the policy influencing side of things is what we're going to be trying to work on.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:28):**  And I'm really hopeful that we're going to be able to start something like this going  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:31):**  in the East Midlands. So watch that space.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:34):**  Jason Vale And Rachel, just finally, could you tell me  
**[0:41:37-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:37):**  what you think the key ingredients are of a really fantastic urban micro farm business?  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:42):**  Rachel Smith We definitely need the skills. And that's  
**[0:41:44-0:41:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:44):**  something that we're working on efficient design. So using that land to the best produce  
**[0:41:49-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:49):**  and productivity levels, and then routes to market, which includes having that local customer  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:54):**  base, you have to have those routes to market, whether that's commercial through restaurants  
**[0:41:57-0:42:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:41:57):**  and cafes, or direct to customer, and getting those networks set up so that businesses can  
**[0:42:02-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:42:02):**  pass their produce on.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:42:03):**  Jason Vale Fantastic. That's been so interesting to  
**[0:42:07-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Urban-food-e1kqtqq#t=0:42:07):**  to dip into this world of urban agriculture. And unfortunately, that's all we've got time

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finlow Costain. This is the final episode in our Agroecology  series and I'm joined by two innovative and inspirational dairy farmers who are putting  agroecology into practice. David Finlay is from The Ethical Dairy in Dumfries and Galloway  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:21):**  and Bryce Cunningham is from Moscow Farm in Ayrshire. The Ethical Dairy and Moscow Farm  can both be found on Twitter and on Instagram. Welcome both, let's start by getting a feeling  for who you are and what you do. And David, if I can come to you first, could you just  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:36):**  describe your farm and tell us what you produce?  Hi Finlow, yes hi folks. Our farm is about 830 acres, based in the south-west of Scotland,  about a mile from the sea. We're lies between 30 and 300 feet above sea level. The land  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:52):**  is very rugged, rocky, which makes for good grassland, but not good for anything else  other than trees. There's about 500 acres of permanent, improved grasslands, 200 acres  of rough grazing, 100 acres of woodlands of which 75 acres were planted in the last 20  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:10):**  years, mixed broadleaves. There's 130 dairy cows and all the stock from the dairy, young  stock reared and finished or taken through to breeding. And there's 300 breeding sheep,  which are easy care. We produce 400,000 litres of milk and 400 lambs.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:31):**  And Bryce, how big is your farm and what do you produce?  So here at my school, we are predominantly a dairy farm. A little bit smaller than David's,  we've got 220 acres of permanent pasture. We're farming 50 milk and cows, we have another  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:44):**  40 for all of us. In south-west Scotland, we're about 25 miles south of Glasgow, a little  further north than David at the ethical dairy. And we also on the farm ourselves, we also  have a processing site. And the idea of that is we're also processing milk from our other  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:56):**  five organic dairy farms in south-west Scotland as well. And we are, we're only really producing  about 125,000 litres a year. However, that is increasing every year as we get better at  our cow-calf dairying and we sort of build in efficiencies and improve our breeding as  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:12):**  time goes on.  Great, thank you. And David, you farm regeneratively. You're also one of the early adopters or the  innovators of cow with calf dairy farming in the UK. This wasn't always the case. So  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:24):**  what was your farm like when you started and why did you change the way that you farmed?  I came back to the farm after 10 years of consultancy to implement the preachings that  I'd been doing for those 10 years. The farm at that time was pretty low-key, low-input,  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:42):**  old rotations, 10 years of grass, a year of forage, turnips, kale and rape. And I came  in and intensified. So we cranked up the numbers, lashed on fertilisers and pesticides and increased  output probably by about 100%. But the downside was, well, the costs were shooting up and  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:06):**  the mortality and morbidity of the stock. It took a lot of looking after because we  were pretty intensive. And that was troubling me. But you did become desensitised to it  because that's what everybody was doing. And really, I suppose it's only when Wilma came  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:25):**  along, she was aghast at what was happening on the farm coming from a non-farming background.  And that kind of started me on that, the process of rethinking what we were doing and why we  were doing it.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:40):**  And that rethinking is clearly, it's been at the heart of your journey ever since then.  Now, alongside your dairy farming, you also built your own successful ice cream business,  Cream of Galloway ice cream, and you built your own adventure playground, which was attracting  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:53):**  up to 75,000 visitors a year at its peak, which is incredible. Were you just not busy  enough with farming?  It really goes back to the late 80s when we were being warned by SRUC or SAC as it was  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:07):**  in those days, that the General Agreement in Trades and Tariff, the big bogeyman that's  going to come along and club us all, that we had 10 years to get our businesses in order  and become independent of subsidies, basically. That was the message that was put out there.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:24):**  So it was about deciding how do we add value? You have tourism and adding value to the military.  The milk was the route that we took. It worked. It was the right answer at the time. When  we were investing in the diversification businesses, we really didn't spend a lot on the farm other  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:41):**  than fertilisers and pesticides. The investment went into the infrastructure for the visitor  attraction and the ice cream. And so that was a major investment, but there was a lot  of help, a lot of the government help at that time to allow farmers to diversify. It was  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:56):**  very much the buzzword at the time.  Bryce, you were working for Mercedes-Benz and now you're toiling in the cattle shed.  So what happened to you?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:04):**  I was born here at the farm. As I was growing up, I had a typical relationship with my father  that is probably more than most farms in Scotland today. And basically when I turned 16 and  left the school, I decided that farming wasn't for me. My father and I had some crosswords  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:20):**  and I went off to Mercedes-Benz to start being an apprentice technician. And during my time  at Mercedes-Benz, I spent 10 years there. I had very much set my eyes on becoming a manager  of a couple of sites in South West Scotland. I was really loving the driving around in  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:34):**  fancy cars. However, I got a phone call in my tenth year at Mercedes-Benz from my mother  and she said that my father wasn't very well, she didn't know what was wrong. However, the  same day my grandpa had been told he had a terminal heart condition. So I decided to  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:46):**  take a bit of a holiday from my job at Mercedes-Benz, ask for a couple of months leave and I came  back to the farm just to see what was happening. And we discovered very recently after that  that my father also had a terminal condition as well. My father had terminal cancer and  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:58):**  my grandpa had a terminal heart condition. And everything just sort of snowballed from  there. My grandpa, he died a few months later. My dad, he died a year later. So we sort of  flung into this dairy farm, which I knew nothing about coming back to very little interest  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:11):**  when I was young. The farm at the time was 150 high production cows. They were inside  all year round. We threw a lot of fertilizer, hauled a lot of grass to the cows and a lot  of cereals into them. And we also milked three times a day when I first come home and four  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:24):**  times a day a year later. So we're milking every six hours.  And yet, even though you were so busy with that, you know, the margins at that time,  margins now in dairy are just so small. And so you were moving from what was a really  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:36):**  high value industry to a commodity industry. And that must have just been really odd for  you. And I wonder how that influenced the way that you wanted a farm going forwards.  I remember the conversation I had with dad, you know, I come home and dad said, you can't  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:50):**  think of this like a car garage. It's not the same kind of business. And I mean, of  course, every business is the same. And as you can imagine, I had the biggest learning  curve in history. Trying to get my head around that one. But I suppose, I mean, in a way  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:02):**  that the decision was made for me, you know, the month my dad died, the commodity price  collapsed. We went from a milk price of 27 pence per litre down to nine pence per litre  within six months. And to put that into bigger numbers, my first year in farming, I mean,  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:15):**  I lost 110,000 pounds. Then the bank decided that because of my lack of knowledge and the  significant losses I had made and the changes to the business, they pulled funding. And  we were basically left in a situation where as a tenant farm, we couldn't sell the farm.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:29):**  So we had to sell as many cows as we could. The only ones that were left were the cows  that weren't producing enough milk, weren't in calves or had sore feet. And I got left  in a better position where we had to do something different. And it was at that time I realised  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:40):**  that this high production system had been chasing and trying to make points or a penny  in profits just wasn't working anymore. And it was time for a real change. And that real  change at the time for me was selling our milk directly and becoming organic, just the  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:53):**  same way that my grandpa had done way back in the 50s and 60s before fertilisers and  chemicals became the mainstay of agriculture.  So what really you were doing was coming into this commodity industry and trying to re-establish  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:04):**  value. Your farm also has a link to the poet Robbie Burns or Rabby Burns.  Yes, you're absolutely right. We're very proud that Robbie Burns and his family had  come to Miss Guell. When it comes to the marketing of our milk, back when everything fell down  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:20):**  round about me, I really didn't know which way to turn. And it came to me that the best  thing we could do is try and recreate the milk that Robbie Burns would have drank. So  back in those days, Robbie Burns himself had air-shifted cows just like we did. They would  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:33):**  have eaten a diet predominantly of grass, which we were looking to do that as well,  because we didn't have any money to be able to afford these concentrates we're pumping into  the cows. And of course, chemicals and fertilisers were a thing back in Burns' day, so to work  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:45):**  with nature and use nature's flow and nature's rhythm and language to be able to farm. And  it was the very thing that sort of done it for us. And out the other side, here we are,  this is the milk that Burns himself would have drank and we've never looked back.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:58):**  Now, both of you are organic farmers, but you've both told me that being organic by  itself just isn't enough. So Bryce, why isn't it enough? And having gone regenerative,  why do you still keep up the organic certification?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:11):**  Bryce  I think it's interesting. I think it's interesting that you've been talking about the  output as you went forward to become organic. However, at the time, I was looking at the  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:42):**  business in various different ways and I realised that because the bank had done what it did  to us, that nobody was going to give us finance, but we actually couldn't invest in my farm  the way that the organic agriculture required. We started seeing things that because we couldn't  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:56):**  pre-plan and reseat and do the things that people would normally do, going from conventional  stocking rate density. I just saw a spiral happening and it wasn't a good one. And at  the same time, I actually stumbled upon Alan Savory's video that he did, the TED Talk  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:09):**  video that I'm sure everyone's watching now. And it was just like a light bulb moment.  I just thought, that's incredible. There's something in this. The only thing I couldn't  do is link up how Alan Savory could talk about desertification and how that actual thinking  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:22):**  can be used in Scotland. So I went and actually did the holistic management course with the  BLM and then realised that we could use our cows as herding animals and move them every  day and regenerate our land. I don't want to come out there and say that regenerative  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:35):**  is better because of X and organic is better because of Y. It's actually two different  systems and it's actually varied more than what most people think. I really do support  organic agriculture. I really support regenerative agriculture. And obviously regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:47):**  is something that's still in the early days. 10, 15 years ago, nobody was really talking  about it. Now it's become a buzz-bub, if you like. And the question of why do we still  keep up organic certification? I do so because I truly believe in it. I believe that organic  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:00):**  certification is something that a lot of people can look to and work within the regulations  of. There's not really much written down from a regenerative point of view. So if someone  was wanting to become an regenerative farmer, they could go and see lots of different ways  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:13):**  of it being done. However, organic just has that certification and that written down set  of standards that people could follow and understand. And also the other side of things  is organic certification, removing myself as a farmer and putting my dairy processor  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:27):**  hat on, we can support other organic dairy farms in South West Scotland. We can buy the  milk, give them a fair price for the milk that we buy and then sell it out to the consumer.  And explaining organic certification to the consumer, it's something that they can understand  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:40):**  more easily. So what we do at Miss Gill is we actually have two different strands. The  milk that's produced on Miss Gill, we have a little gold foil that was in the cap of  that and that's for regeneratively farmed milk and we have a marketing backup for that  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:51):**  that explains to the customer what it is. But then the mainstay that 90% of the milk  we sell is organic and people understand that because a good backup from the organic certifiers  about what organic actually means and the benefits to the environment there.  
**[0:12:03-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:03):**  Toby  David, you're organic and you're also regenerative and you've talked about there being differences  in terms of the outcomes for both your land and the livestock between those systems.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:14):**  Well, I think my experience is very similar to Bryce's. We started with organic and it  brought us into contact with people who were talking the beyond organic message, the regenerative  message. What organic brought to us was discipline. It stopped us from sliding back because the  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:30):**  temptation always was in the early days, particularly when things weren't working, as Bryce mentioned,  initially your farm takes a shock. You've been dependent on these artificial inputs  for long enough and then your natural systems have been badly damaged. It takes quite a  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:45):**  few years before that recovers. What we find was that once we got through that painful  transitional barrier of the first, well, for us it was 10 years probably because we didn't  really know what we were doing. Then the farm started to perform. We were managing it better  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:00):**  and the system was working and it was the discipline of the organic and the standards  that it set that set us on the right direction. It was then a case of the gaining experience  and confidence that this type of farming based around harnessing the power of nature that  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:21):**  was key to getting a long-term profitable, resilient, robust business model, which was  not dependent on the vagaries of the commodity markets globally.  It's really about understanding better natural systems, trying to harness better the power  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:39):**  that's there. This stuff's been around for billions of years. It's kind of got it right.  We came along thinking we could do better and really the evidence is we can't. What  we do do, the interference that we cause is highly damaging to the environment and to  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:54):**  people. The regen message goes further again than the land. The land is so important. Then  just the animals on that land and the welfare of those animals, which is what took us to  the next stage was the suckling the dairy cows and milking them once a day. Creating  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:12):**  a more natural system for the dairy cow to see how she responded. If she responded the  same way as the land, which we have actually found to be the case. We're now in a fourth  year of the suckling experiment and the cows initially, yeah, they were in shock. They  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:26):**  didn't know what was going on. They liked having the cows, but they didn't know what  the rules were anymore. It's quite extraordinary. Our relationship with the cows, our understanding  of the cows and their behaviour, all that is part of regen. Then there's the guys, the  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:40):**  people on the farm and trying to give them a balanced life so that they're not working  60, 70, 80 hours a week, which is so common in dairy these days. It's trying to give them  a 40 hour week with a decent income so that they have got some quality of life. All these  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:59):**  aspects of regen come together and it's all based around organic setting the baseline,  the standards and then building from there. So I think the two go hand in hand.  Rich Poulson Bryce, just coming back to you, again, looking  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:11):**  at the market for milk, where most people are buying commodity milk, commodity cheese,  they're buying it through retailers. How difficult is it for you as an independent producer to  find a market for your milk?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:24):**  The market out there is certainly a funny thing. When we started out, believe it or  not, for the first month or so, it was an absolute disaster for us. We literally couldn't  get anyone to buy our milk. The local area was absolutely saturated with doorstep delivery  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:42):**  dairies delivering conventional milk at a very low price. We decided to stay away from  doorsteps initially. That left shops and coffee shops. However, round about the shops and  coffee shops, for the first year, we got a very low hit rate. We just couldn't seem to  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:54):**  get anyone to take it because of the increased price. So we're basically getting near it  at 40 and 50% more expensive than the next producer.  The break for us came that... Back when I was saying that we were really looking to  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:06):**  launch the milk that Rabby burns with a drink, we had discovered that because of this very  old fashioned way of brewing the milk that we used, it actually worked extremely well  in coffee shops, particularly speciality coffee shops. We were looking for a very specific  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:18):**  milk. That gave us a big break. We were up to Glasgow and met a few of the coffee shops.  It just sort of managed to get into one, two, three and it kind of grew from there. That  would have been great for us. What I could have done is I could have just stopped then  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:29):**  and just sold all the milk we had on the scale organically and sold it directly to the consumers.  That was working really well for us. One of the biggest changes I've made is when  I realised that there was a market there and the potential for growth that we could really  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:42):**  do something with in the industry. What I wanted to do is I always had this thing in  my head. I remember when the bank manager came to me that day and told me, that's it,  it's over. You're paying this money back. I always remember when we were milked by a  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:55):**  phone and said the milk price was going from £27 down to £9. It's never left me. I just  thought instead of us as one fan just trying to sell all the milk and make the profit,  we could potentially start inviting other fans along with us. We spoke to Omsco. Omsco  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:09):**  is the largest organic co-op in the UK for dairy. We spoke to them and asked if it's  something they'd be interested in and they turned out that it was. We started moving  in and chasing a very different market. We increased our marketing. We started targeting  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:23):**  doorsteps, independent coffee shops, independent retailers and places like bakers and ice cream  makers. We started saying, we're not just one farm, we're a collective of farms and  we're really looking to change Scottish dairy. We're looking to drive fairness in milk from  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:35):**  grass to glass. That was a real challenge for us. I didn't quite realise at the time how  much of a challenge it was going to be to try and bake into the wider market. We were  going in there with a product which was 30 and 40% more expensive. Our base costs were  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:49):**  higher because we're paying the farmers more than what the other dairies were. Also, our  processing costs were higher because we also were brewing the milk instead of pasteurising  it. There is a market out there, but for farmers, farmers themselves have been down the route  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:01):**  of vending machines, which have worked very well for the local community. We were trying  to position ourselves slightly different. We are trying to get coverage across Scotland  to realise our vision of sustainable dairy. The market's there and it's a real challenge  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:13):**  trying to compete against the conventional milk market. However, I believe that marketing  is starting to really get out there. People know what organic milk is and they know what  misgivings stand for. I believe the market is growing and I'm really excited for where  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:25):**  this year is going to bring us. Mason, both of you are known because of your  cow and calf dairy farming. I want to go into that area in a little bit more detail. David,  you've been farming for 35 years. Let me take you back to the start. You've said that,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:40):**  despite some misgivings that you had about dairy farming in terms of chemical inputs  and the cattle welfare, that you felt that you became desensitised to some extent.  That the way that you farmed was just normal. It was the way it was done. But then later,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:54):**  partly when your wife Wilma came along, but also when the farm started opening up to the public,  people started asking questions and reacting to those common dairy practices that you were  talking about and that they could see on the farm. You started to feel that things had to change.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:09):**  I'm just wondering, what kind of things were the public picking up? What were they asking?  What struck me, there was two things struck me. The first thing that struck me was how  disconnected the public were from farming. They had no idea what farming was at all.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:24):**  All they had was the Janet and John schoolbooks idea of farming. The farmer was a bit of straw  in his mouth and a couple of hens and cows and pigs and what have you. And that was the  perception they came to the farm with. And so they were very bemused by the whole thing.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:39):**  Because we were running, walking and farm tours on tractor and trailer every day during the summer.  So we had a lot of people coming into contact with us. The other thing that struck me was  the separation of cows and calves. So that was something that created a lot of angst amongst  
**[0:20:00-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:00):**  particularly women, visitors. It made me realize that, yes, this was an issue that was possibly  going to become something of a problem down the road. So that's it, the idea thinking.  And the question was always coming back to me from Wilma and from our visitor center manager,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:19):**  why don't you leave the cows and calves to get out? My reply was, I'd be out of business in  five minutes. And it was only when we came to rebuild the whole dairy that we thought,  okay, can we do this? We went across to the Netherlands, we took the whole team across  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:33):**  and saw some Dutch guys who were smaller scale, 30, 40 cows. And they were leaving the calves on  for three months, they were organic. And it saved them from rearing the calves separately.  The downside of three months weaning was the calves went backwards very quickly because they  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:50):**  were still heavily dependent on physical and emotional contact with the cow. We realized  that that was going to be just too soon. And we knew that this had to be managed if we were going  to do it. We came back thinking, yeah, we could do that. And really that set us on that train.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:05):**  And we rebuilt our dairy and we built in facilities for handling the calves and cows  together. And it took us four years to build the dairy because we're building most of it ourselves.  So we evolved, we trialled it first in 2012 for six months, and we learned a lot from that. And  
**[0:21:26-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:26):**  that informed us for the going wholesale into the cow's calf without question. And of course,  it just happened to coincide because once we finished, completed that, we started making cheese  in small scale in our ice cream dairy. And at the same time, we thought, right, we're going to have  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:46):**  to scale up this operation. And we started building our cheese dairy. And that took us three years.  Luke Stirling Yes, absolutely. It's about leaving the baby calves with the mothers.  And just for me, the reason that we went down this route was it was just at the start of the  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:35):**  time I was looking into regenerative farming. And the crux for me was that taking the concentrates  away from the cows and managing the grass better, but then we were still having to buy concentrates  in for the calves, and the calves were still not growing as well as some of the calves out there  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:49):**  they would see on our systems. I had a real interest in what David and Wilma were doing.  At the time David and Wilma were pioneers in Scotland for Cowie Cab Daring and we were very  lucky that we were not too far away from them. That was the reason we kind of got into it.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:02):**  Going back to the whale food of the animals, me myself when I first started the Cowie Cab thing,  I wasn't really doing it right. I didn't have the opportunity to go to the farms and see it.  However, someone joined my farm two years ago, Elizabeth, and we called her the Cow Happiness  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:17):**  Manager and that's exactly what her job is, is just to go out and make sure the cows are happy.  She's fantastic. She's been in with the cows and calves every day. Between five and six months,  as our weaning age, it's very calf dependent. We don't have a set date. We just kind of see  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:31):**  how the calves are doing. It's quite different, isn't it, across different cow and calf producers?  And I guess that's sort of part of the question, is whether it's possible to define it.  I suppose there is, yes. I mean, you've just touched on it there perfectly. It's like what  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:45):**  I was saying earlier on. If you think about organic versus regenerative farming,  organic is a very specific set of rules that regenerative doesn't really. And it's probably  the same with cow with calf dairy. The way that David does it, the way that I do it,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:58):**  there could be someone who's multi-suckling four or five calves, or sorry, that's my  excuse, maybe two or three calves into the same cow. And they could be calling themselves cow  with calf dairies. There just isn't a certain standard out there. So I suppose every system is  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:11):**  quite different. As I mentioned, we wean between five and six months calf dependent. Others have  a very set date of three, four, five, six months, whatever that may be. And so perhaps that's  something that is needing to be looked at as a set of standards on it. And I know that David and  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:25):**  all of us are pioneering that as well through some of the research that they've done too.  Toby  It shows how important it is, doesn't it, to have these audit sort of processes.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:32):**  And obviously, if you're selling direct to a customer and you can have a conversation  with the customer, the customer is able to see what you're doing and understand it.  Whereas if you're selling, you know, even one or two steps down the line, then being able to  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:45):**  explain and demonstrate through labelling and through the narrative on websites becomes critical.  And obviously that then is underpinned by the organic certification that you were talking  about. Now, Bryce, I think you've talked about the calves taking about a third of the milk.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:01):**  And, you know, with dairy margins being incredibly tight, even, you know,  when you're independent and you're adding value, how are you making the economics work?  Bryce  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:38):**  Two pounds twenty to two pounds fifty a litre. Compile that to dairy at forty and fifty pence  a litre in the shelves just along the aisle from it. And you see the big difference there. So what  I believe was if people are willing to pay a certain amount for plant based milks because  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:52):**  they believe that that is more ethical, that's more environmental. Whatever they've been told  from the PR and the marketing campaigns and massive companies, they are willing to pay it  for that. So what I did was I calculated how much I believe that the milk was worth and how much it  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:06):**  was going to cost to produce it. I put a price out there for a pint of milk. It was almost double  the price of the normal organic milk that we produced but on par with the plant based milks.  And very fortunately for me, our local community had backed us with it. People are travelling to  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:20):**  buy the gold milk that we sell. I won't lie, it's not been the easiest thing we've ever done.  You know, there's not many people out there trying to do this in a liquid way. But every year we've  been supported better and better. And because we've been supported more and more, we've been  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:33):**  able to put more thoughts, more processes and more intelligent thoughts into how we feed our cows,  how we manage the system. And we're learning all the time as well. You know, it's just trying to  get milk production up but keep the ethics of what we do correct and the welfare of the animal  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:47):**  is key obviously. So yes, it's certainly getting there. But because it's only working because of  this direct relationship with the consumer, the market's certainly not there yet for larger dairies  to do it in the size of their farmers. However, I believe that is coming. I believe that people  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:00):**  are looking into it and we ourselves are speaking to another dairy farm about potentially getting  this route and trialling it. So you know, there's a lot of work being done out there by a lot of  people and it's all about having the relationship with the end user who believes in that way of  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:13):**  farming. Interesting. Now, David, I suppose, you know, when you're farming with livestock,  then there's always going to be, you know, a series of trade offs, you know, some positive  and some less positive between the economics and the ethics. And you talked about having  
**[0:27:29-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:29):**  experimented with cow and calf dairy in 2012. You then underwent a whole farm transition in 2016.  And I mean, as Bryce said, your work has been hugely influential for many other independent  dairy producers, but it's not been an easy journey at all. And I wonder if you could briefly talk us  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:48):**  through, you know, some of the challenges that you faced on this journey. Yes, it's been challenging.  The, we're still learning. I would say that the cow-calf, it sounds like a very simple thing,  leave the calf with the cow, cow raise the calf, jobs are good. But it's not as simple as that,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:06):**  by any means. The whole dynamics of the system changed completely. I very much equate it to  the transition to organic farming, which was, it was a whole system change.  But at least with organic, there's a route map and you were doing it from scratch.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:22):**  Absolutely. Believe me, it has been quite painful at times, not just for us, the cows and calves as  well. When a cow is suckling a calf, she wants to keep the best milk for the calf. So she doesn't  let down the high fat milk. We get semi-skimmed milk from cows that are suckling. The cows that  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:41):**  are suckling, if there's not a bull presence in there, in the herd, you have what they call  lactational anestrus, which is a 30-day delay in anestrus following calving. Where if you have got  a tight calving pattern, as we do, you can lose half the cows slipping through into a following  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:01):**  calving groups. So the management changes, the calves, you have to be able to manage the calves  because at a certain stage, once they get to about three months of age, they will drink as much milk  as the cow produces. This is where the compromises start coming in. So you say, right, we'll separate  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:19):**  the cow and calf overnight. So your layout of your buildings or your fields and tracks have to  accommodate that change in management. When you've got cows and calves together indoors, which we do,  you have a totally different dynamic in the bacteriology and microbiology. So that we've  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:40):**  had problems with cryptosporidium, Pastorala pneumonia, but on each occasion there has been  management changes that we could make that would overcome these problems. So yeah, we're blundering  our way through the system and learning as we go. And the cows are the same because in the first six  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:01):**  months, the cows didn't know when they came out of the parlour whether the calves were going to  still be there or not. So they were reluctant to leave the calf to come into the parlour. But no,  it's not a problem. They're queuing in the morning to come and get milked and they know the calves  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:15):**  are going to be there when they come back. So it's the whole relationship, the stress, the dynamics  of disease and physical management and the stress with us and the staff. It's very, very depressing  when you've got calves that are dying from cryptosporidium and you don't know what to do  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:32):**  about it. But when you get a problem solved, it's just so inspiring. It gives everybody a real boost.  So this is a critical thing. Staff, absolutely key. If your staff are not interested or don't  think it's going to work, it won't work. The staff really have to be on board, absolutely, because  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:53):**  the human-cow relationship is critical to this system. But yeah, every year it's getting better.  Every year we see a progress. So we've got a long way to go. We're getting something like three and  a half thousand litres per cow from a pasture fed, 100% pasture based diet. And they're giving around  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:12):**  about two to two and a half thousand litres to the calf over the five months. And so that's giving us  a cow producing five, five and a half thousand litres of milk from forage, which is I think by  any measure is a pretty good production. So that shows that the cow does respond to the management,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:31):**  it's about us, then refining that to get the best of everybody gets the best of both worlds.  And just to be specific, David, when you're talking about cow with calf,  are the calves with the cows 24 hours a day until they naturally wean?  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:47):**  No, no, no, no, no, no, we couldn't afford to do that. Three months in, roughly. So we have  a fairly tight calving block, two blocks, one in the autumn, one in the spring, and that's to give  us bounce all year round of milk supply. After three months, you must separate overnight or you  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:03):**  won't get any milk. You just won't. The cow will, some cows will give milk, but the majority will  not give you milk because they can hold all the milk back for the calf and the calf will drink it.  So we separate overnight for the next couple of months. Still we're milking once a day. So it's  
**[0:32:20-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:20):**  not, it's not onerous by any means. And so you'll gain another seven or eight litres just by doing  that. So instantly you go from maybe down to three or four litres, you're back up into the double  figures again for a while. And then by the fifth and sixth months again, the cow yield profile is  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:39):**  dropping off and she can hold back a lot of that milk for the calf, even though they've been  separated by for 12 hours. So yeah, it's about managing the system. It's a compromise. And  I think that, you know, the cows kind of know as well, they know it's a compromise. They know that  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:57):**  they've got to get a little and to get a little. We then wean the calves at five to six months.  So the weaning process again, the whole system is based, our management system that we're evolving  for this setup is based around transitioning the cows, reducing stress, cutting stress out of the  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:13):**  system. One of the several big advantages of separating overnight is A, you get more milk. B,  the calf peer bond gets strengthened and you're starting to weaken the calf mother bond. Then also  when the calf is 24 hours on the cow, it doesn't eat solids. So the rumen doesn't develop. So  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:33):**  overnight separation, calf gets hungry, starts eating because they've got access to their own  food, their silage supply. They go and start eating forage. And so the rumen develops.  So that when you get the five to six months, you've got a calf that physically and emotionally  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:49):**  is prepared for separation. We then use things called quiet wean nose clips. And these are very,  very clever little clips that pop into the nose. And it's a flap that hangs down over the top lip  of the calf and it can drink and eat solids and drink water. But when it reaches into the teat  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:09):**  of the cow, the little flap pushes the teat away. It is very, very clever. It just takes seconds to  pop these in and we leave that in those in for a week. And by the end of that week, the calf is  physically independent of the mother. We then take the clips out and we don't open the gate. And we  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:27):**  used to have a ferrari in the morning when we didn't open the gate for the first couple of days  it was just deafening. But now there's just grumbling. There's grumbling, we've got the clips  in, there's grumbling for a day or two. But you know, it is so quiet. It is just a trance. So  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:48):**  again, management, there is a management solution really to all the technological problems that  we have and we don't need invasive technology. We can manage these things. So it's management  based systems is absolutely key. Fantastic. Well, thank you both so much. That's been  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:35:06):**  really fascinating. And that's all we have time for.

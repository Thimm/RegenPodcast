### Farm Gate  (Tue, 13 Apr 2021 13:29:53)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finlow Costain. This is the final episode in our Agroecology  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:10):**  series and I'm joined by two innovative and inspirational dairy farmers who are putting  
**[0:00:15-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:15):**  agroecology into practice. David Finlay is from The Ethical Dairy in Dumfries and Galloway  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:21):**  and Bryce Cunningham is from Moscow Farm in Ayrshire. The Ethical Dairy and Moscow Farm  
**[0:00:26-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:26):**  can both be found on Twitter and on Instagram. Welcome both, let's start by getting a feeling  
**[0:00:32-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:32):**  for who you are and what you do. And David, if I can come to you first, could you just  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:36):**  describe your farm and tell us what you produce?  
**[0:00:39-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:39):**  Hi Finlow, yes hi folks. Our farm is about 830 acres, based in the south-west of Scotland,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:45):**  about a mile from the sea. We're lies between 30 and 300 feet above sea level. The land  
**[0:00:52-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:52):**  is very rugged, rocky, which makes for good grassland, but not good for anything else  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:00:58):**  other than trees. There's about 500 acres of permanent, improved grasslands, 200 acres  
**[0:01:03-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:03):**  of rough grazing, 100 acres of woodlands of which 75 acres were planted in the last 20  
**[0:01:10-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:10):**  years, mixed broadleaves. There's 130 dairy cows and all the stock from the dairy, young  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:17):**  stock reared and finished or taken through to breeding. And there's 300 breeding sheep,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:24):**  which are easy care. We produce 400,000 litres of milk and 400 lambs.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:31):**  And Bryce, how big is your farm and what do you produce?  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:34):**  So here at my school, we are predominantly a dairy farm. A little bit smaller than David's,  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:39):**  we've got 220 acres of permanent pasture. We're farming 50 milk and cows, we have another  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:44):**  40 for all of us. In south-west Scotland, we're about 25 miles south of Glasgow, a little  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:49):**  further north than David at the ethical dairy. And we also on the farm ourselves, we also  
**[0:01:53-0:01:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:53):**  have a processing site. And the idea of that is we're also processing milk from our other  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:01:56):**  five organic dairy farms in south-west Scotland as well. And we are, we're only really producing  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:02):**  about 125,000 litres a year. However, that is increasing every year as we get better at  
**[0:02:08-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:08):**  our cow-calf dairying and we sort of build in efficiencies and improve our breeding as  
**[0:02:12-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:12):**  time goes on.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:13):**  Great, thank you. And David, you farm regeneratively. You're also one of the early adopters or the  
**[0:02:19-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:19):**  innovators of cow with calf dairy farming in the UK. This wasn't always the case. So  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:24):**  what was your farm like when you started and why did you change the way that you farmed?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:29):**  I came back to the farm after 10 years of consultancy to implement the preachings that  
**[0:02:35-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:35):**  I'd been doing for those 10 years. The farm at that time was pretty low-key, low-input,  
**[0:02:42-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:42):**  old rotations, 10 years of grass, a year of forage, turnips, kale and rape. And I came  
**[0:02:49-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:49):**  in and intensified. So we cranked up the numbers, lashed on fertilisers and pesticides and increased  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:02:58):**  output probably by about 100%. But the downside was, well, the costs were shooting up and  
**[0:03:06-0:03:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:06):**  the mortality and morbidity of the stock. It took a lot of looking after because we  
**[0:03:13-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:13):**  were pretty intensive. And that was troubling me. But you did become desensitised to it  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:21):**  because that's what everybody was doing. And really, I suppose it's only when Wilma came  
**[0:03:25-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:25):**  along, she was aghast at what was happening on the farm coming from a non-farming background.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:33):**  And that kind of started me on that, the process of rethinking what we were doing and why we  
**[0:03:39-0:03:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:39):**  were doing it.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:40):**  And that rethinking is clearly, it's been at the heart of your journey ever since then.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:44):**  Now, alongside your dairy farming, you also built your own successful ice cream business,  
**[0:03:50-0:03:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:50):**  Cream of Galloway ice cream, and you built your own adventure playground, which was attracting  
**[0:03:53-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:53):**  up to 75,000 visitors a year at its peak, which is incredible. Were you just not busy  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:03:58):**  enough with farming?  
**[0:04:00-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:00):**  It really goes back to the late 80s when we were being warned by SRUC or SAC as it was  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:07):**  in those days, that the General Agreement in Trades and Tariff, the big bogeyman that's  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:13):**  going to come along and club us all, that we had 10 years to get our businesses in order  
**[0:04:17-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:17):**  and become independent of subsidies, basically. That was the message that was put out there.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:24):**  So it was about deciding how do we add value? You have tourism and adding value to the military.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:30):**  The milk was the route that we took. It worked. It was the right answer at the time. When  
**[0:04:35-0:04:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:35):**  we were investing in the diversification businesses, we really didn't spend a lot on the farm other  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:41):**  than fertilisers and pesticides. The investment went into the infrastructure for the visitor  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:47):**  attraction and the ice cream. And so that was a major investment, but there was a lot  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:52):**  of help, a lot of the government help at that time to allow farmers to diversify. It was  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:56):**  very much the buzzword at the time.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:04:58):**  Bryce, you were working for Mercedes-Benz and now you're toiling in the cattle shed.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:03):**  So what happened to you?  
**[0:05:04-0:05:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:04):**  I was born here at the farm. As I was growing up, I had a typical relationship with my father  
**[0:05:09-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:09):**  that is probably more than most farms in Scotland today. And basically when I turned 16 and  
**[0:05:16-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:16):**  left the school, I decided that farming wasn't for me. My father and I had some crosswords  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:20):**  and I went off to Mercedes-Benz to start being an apprentice technician. And during my time  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:25):**  at Mercedes-Benz, I spent 10 years there. I had very much set my eyes on becoming a manager  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:29):**  of a couple of sites in South West Scotland. I was really loving the driving around in  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:34):**  fancy cars. However, I got a phone call in my tenth year at Mercedes-Benz from my mother  
**[0:05:38-0:05:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:38):**  and she said that my father wasn't very well, she didn't know what was wrong. However, the  
**[0:05:42-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:42):**  same day my grandpa had been told he had a terminal heart condition. So I decided to  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:46):**  take a bit of a holiday from my job at Mercedes-Benz, ask for a couple of months leave and I came  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:50):**  back to the farm just to see what was happening. And we discovered very recently after that  
**[0:05:54-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:54):**  that my father also had a terminal condition as well. My father had terminal cancer and  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:05:58):**  my grandpa had a terminal heart condition. And everything just sort of snowballed from  
**[0:06:01-0:06:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:01):**  there. My grandpa, he died a few months later. My dad, he died a year later. So we sort of  
**[0:06:06-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:06):**  flung into this dairy farm, which I knew nothing about coming back to very little interest  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:11):**  when I was young. The farm at the time was 150 high production cows. They were inside  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:15):**  all year round. We threw a lot of fertilizer, hauled a lot of grass to the cows and a lot  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:20):**  of cereals into them. And we also milked three times a day when I first come home and four  
**[0:06:24-0:06:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:24):**  times a day a year later. So we're milking every six hours.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:27):**  And yet, even though you were so busy with that, you know, the margins at that time,  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:32):**  margins now in dairy are just so small. And so you were moving from what was a really  
**[0:06:36-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:36):**  high value industry to a commodity industry. And that must have just been really odd for  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:42):**  you. And I wonder how that influenced the way that you wanted a farm going forwards.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:46):**  I remember the conversation I had with dad, you know, I come home and dad said, you can't  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:50):**  think of this like a car garage. It's not the same kind of business. And I mean, of  
**[0:06:54-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:54):**  course, every business is the same. And as you can imagine, I had the biggest learning  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:06:57):**  curve in history. Trying to get my head around that one. But I suppose, I mean, in a way  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:02):**  that the decision was made for me, you know, the month my dad died, the commodity price  
**[0:07:06-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:06):**  collapsed. We went from a milk price of 27 pence per litre down to nine pence per litre  
**[0:07:11-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:11):**  within six months. And to put that into bigger numbers, my first year in farming, I mean,  
**[0:07:15-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:15):**  I lost 110,000 pounds. Then the bank decided that because of my lack of knowledge and the  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:20):**  significant losses I had made and the changes to the business, they pulled funding. And  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:24):**  we were basically left in a situation where as a tenant farm, we couldn't sell the farm.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:29):**  So we had to sell as many cows as we could. The only ones that were left were the cows  
**[0:07:32-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:32):**  that weren't producing enough milk, weren't in calves or had sore feet. And I got left  
**[0:07:36-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:36):**  in a better position where we had to do something different. And it was at that time I realised  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:40):**  that this high production system had been chasing and trying to make points or a penny  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:44):**  in profits just wasn't working anymore. And it was time for a real change. And that real  
**[0:07:49-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:49):**  change at the time for me was selling our milk directly and becoming organic, just the  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:53):**  same way that my grandpa had done way back in the 50s and 60s before fertilisers and  
**[0:07:57-0:07:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:57):**  chemicals became the mainstay of agriculture.  
**[0:07:59-0:08:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:07:59):**  So what really you were doing was coming into this commodity industry and trying to re-establish  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:04):**  value. Your farm also has a link to the poet Robbie Burns or Rabby Burns.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:10):**  Yes, you're absolutely right. We're very proud that Robbie Burns and his family had  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:15):**  come to Miss Guell. When it comes to the marketing of our milk, back when everything fell down  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:20):**  round about me, I really didn't know which way to turn. And it came to me that the best  
**[0:08:25-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:25):**  thing we could do is try and recreate the milk that Robbie Burns would have drank. So  
**[0:08:29-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:29):**  back in those days, Robbie Burns himself had air-shifted cows just like we did. They would  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:33):**  have eaten a diet predominantly of grass, which we were looking to do that as well,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:37):**  because we didn't have any money to be able to afford these concentrates we're pumping into  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:40):**  the cows. And of course, chemicals and fertilisers were a thing back in Burns' day, so to work  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:45):**  with nature and use nature's flow and nature's rhythm and language to be able to farm. And  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:50):**  it was the very thing that sort of done it for us. And out the other side, here we are,  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:54):**  this is the milk that Burns himself would have drank and we've never looked back.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:08:58):**  Now, both of you are organic farmers, but you've both told me that being organic by  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:03):**  itself just isn't enough. So Bryce, why isn't it enough? And having gone regenerative,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:08):**  why do you still keep up the organic certification?  
**[0:09:11-0:09:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:11):**  Bryce  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:32):**  I think it's interesting. I think it's interesting that you've been talking about the  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:38):**  output as you went forward to become organic. However, at the time, I was looking at the  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:42):**  business in various different ways and I realised that because the bank had done what it did  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:47):**  to us, that nobody was going to give us finance, but we actually couldn't invest in my farm  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:52):**  the way that the organic agriculture required. We started seeing things that because we couldn't  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:09:56):**  pre-plan and reseat and do the things that people would normally do, going from conventional  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:00):**  stocking rate density. I just saw a spiral happening and it wasn't a good one. And at  
**[0:10:05-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:05):**  the same time, I actually stumbled upon Alan Savory's video that he did, the TED Talk  
**[0:10:09-0:10:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:09):**  video that I'm sure everyone's watching now. And it was just like a light bulb moment.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:13):**  I just thought, that's incredible. There's something in this. The only thing I couldn't  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:17):**  do is link up how Alan Savory could talk about desertification and how that actual thinking  
**[0:10:22-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:22):**  can be used in Scotland. So I went and actually did the holistic management course with the  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:25):**  BLM and then realised that we could use our cows as herding animals and move them every  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:30):**  day and regenerate our land. I don't want to come out there and say that regenerative  
**[0:10:35-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:35):**  is better because of X and organic is better because of Y. It's actually two different  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:39):**  systems and it's actually varied more than what most people think. I really do support  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:43):**  organic agriculture. I really support regenerative agriculture. And obviously regenerative agriculture  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:47):**  is something that's still in the early days. 10, 15 years ago, nobody was really talking  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:52):**  about it. Now it's become a buzz-bub, if you like. And the question of why do we still  
**[0:10:56-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:10:56):**  keep up organic certification? I do so because I truly believe in it. I believe that organic  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:00):**  certification is something that a lot of people can look to and work within the regulations  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:05):**  of. There's not really much written down from a regenerative point of view. So if someone  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:10):**  was wanting to become an regenerative farmer, they could go and see lots of different ways  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:13):**  of it being done. However, organic just has that certification and that written down set  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:17):**  of standards that people could follow and understand. And also the other side of things  
**[0:11:21-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:21):**  is organic certification, removing myself as a farmer and putting my dairy processor  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:27):**  hat on, we can support other organic dairy farms in South West Scotland. We can buy the  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:32):**  milk, give them a fair price for the milk that we buy and then sell it out to the consumer.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:36):**  And explaining organic certification to the consumer, it's something that they can understand  
**[0:11:40-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:40):**  more easily. So what we do at Miss Gill is we actually have two different strands. The  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:43):**  milk that's produced on Miss Gill, we have a little gold foil that was in the cap of  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:47):**  that and that's for regeneratively farmed milk and we have a marketing backup for that  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:51):**  that explains to the customer what it is. But then the mainstay that 90% of the milk  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:11:55):**  we sell is organic and people understand that because a good backup from the organic certifiers  
**[0:12:00-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:00):**  about what organic actually means and the benefits to the environment there.  
**[0:12:03-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:03):**  Toby  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:04):**  David, you're organic and you're also regenerative and you've talked about there being differences  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:10):**  in terms of the outcomes for both your land and the livestock between those systems.  
**[0:12:14-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:14):**  Well, I think my experience is very similar to Bryce's. We started with organic and it  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:18):**  brought us into contact with people who were talking the beyond organic message, the regenerative  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:24):**  message. What organic brought to us was discipline. It stopped us from sliding back because the  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:30):**  temptation always was in the early days, particularly when things weren't working, as Bryce mentioned,  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:35):**  initially your farm takes a shock. You've been dependent on these artificial inputs  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:40):**  for long enough and then your natural systems have been badly damaged. It takes quite a  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:45):**  few years before that recovers. What we find was that once we got through that painful  
**[0:12:51-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:51):**  transitional barrier of the first, well, for us it was 10 years probably because we didn't  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:12:55):**  really know what we were doing. Then the farm started to perform. We were managing it better  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:00):**  and the system was working and it was the discipline of the organic and the standards  
**[0:13:05-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:05):**  that it set that set us on the right direction. It was then a case of the gaining experience  
**[0:13:13-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:13):**  and confidence that this type of farming based around harnessing the power of nature that  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:21):**  was key to getting a long-term profitable, resilient, robust business model, which was  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:27):**  not dependent on the vagaries of the commodity markets globally.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:33):**  It's really about understanding better natural systems, trying to harness better the power  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:39):**  that's there. This stuff's been around for billions of years. It's kind of got it right.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:44):**  We came along thinking we could do better and really the evidence is we can't. What  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:49):**  we do do, the interference that we cause is highly damaging to the environment and to  
**[0:13:54-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:13:54):**  people. The regen message goes further again than the land. The land is so important. Then  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:02):**  just the animals on that land and the welfare of those animals, which is what took us to  
**[0:14:06-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:06):**  the next stage was the suckling the dairy cows and milking them once a day. Creating  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:12):**  a more natural system for the dairy cow to see how she responded. If she responded the  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:16):**  same way as the land, which we have actually found to be the case. We're now in a fourth  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:21):**  year of the suckling experiment and the cows initially, yeah, they were in shock. They  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:26):**  didn't know what was going on. They liked having the cows, but they didn't know what  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:30):**  the rules were anymore. It's quite extraordinary. Our relationship with the cows, our understanding  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:35):**  of the cows and their behaviour, all that is part of regen. Then there's the guys, the  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:40):**  people on the farm and trying to give them a balanced life so that they're not working  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:46):**  60, 70, 80 hours a week, which is so common in dairy these days. It's trying to give them  
**[0:14:51-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:51):**  a 40 hour week with a decent income so that they have got some quality of life. All these  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:14:59):**  aspects of regen come together and it's all based around organic setting the baseline,  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:05):**  the standards and then building from there. So I think the two go hand in hand.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:09):**  Rich Poulson Bryce, just coming back to you, again, looking  
**[0:15:11-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:11):**  at the market for milk, where most people are buying commodity milk, commodity cheese,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:17):**  they're buying it through retailers. How difficult is it for you as an independent producer to  
**[0:15:22-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:22):**  find a market for your milk?  
**[0:15:24-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:24):**  The market out there is certainly a funny thing. When we started out, believe it or  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:31):**  not, for the first month or so, it was an absolute disaster for us. We literally couldn't  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:35):**  get anyone to buy our milk. The local area was absolutely saturated with doorstep delivery  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:42):**  dairies delivering conventional milk at a very low price. We decided to stay away from  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:45):**  doorsteps initially. That left shops and coffee shops. However, round about the shops and  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:50):**  coffee shops, for the first year, we got a very low hit rate. We just couldn't seem to  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:54):**  get anyone to take it because of the increased price. So we're basically getting near it  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:15:57):**  at 40 and 50% more expensive than the next producer.  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:01):**  The break for us came that... Back when I was saying that we were really looking to  
**[0:16:06-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:06):**  launch the milk that Rabby burns with a drink, we had discovered that because of this very  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:10):**  old fashioned way of brewing the milk that we used, it actually worked extremely well  
**[0:16:14-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:14):**  in coffee shops, particularly speciality coffee shops. We were looking for a very specific  
**[0:16:18-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:18):**  milk. That gave us a big break. We were up to Glasgow and met a few of the coffee shops.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:23):**  It just sort of managed to get into one, two, three and it kind of grew from there. That  
**[0:16:26-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:26):**  would have been great for us. What I could have done is I could have just stopped then  
**[0:16:29-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:29):**  and just sold all the milk we had on the scale organically and sold it directly to the consumers.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:34):**  That was working really well for us. One of the biggest changes I've made is when  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:38):**  I realised that there was a market there and the potential for growth that we could really  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:42):**  do something with in the industry. What I wanted to do is I always had this thing in  
**[0:16:46-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:46):**  my head. I remember when the bank manager came to me that day and told me, that's it,  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:50):**  it's over. You're paying this money back. I always remember when we were milked by a  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:16:55):**  phone and said the milk price was going from £27 down to £9. It's never left me. I just  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:00):**  thought instead of us as one fan just trying to sell all the milk and make the profit,  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:04):**  we could potentially start inviting other fans along with us. We spoke to Omsco. Omsco  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:09):**  is the largest organic co-op in the UK for dairy. We spoke to them and asked if it's  
**[0:17:13-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:13):**  something they'd be interested in and they turned out that it was. We started moving  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:18):**  in and chasing a very different market. We increased our marketing. We started targeting  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:23):**  doorsteps, independent coffee shops, independent retailers and places like bakers and ice cream  
**[0:17:28-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:28):**  makers. We started saying, we're not just one farm, we're a collective of farms and  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:32):**  we're really looking to change Scottish dairy. We're looking to drive fairness in milk from  
**[0:17:35-0:17:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:35):**  grass to glass. That was a real challenge for us. I didn't quite realise at the time how  
**[0:17:40-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:40):**  much of a challenge it was going to be to try and bake into the wider market. We were  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:43):**  going in there with a product which was 30 and 40% more expensive. Our base costs were  
**[0:17:49-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:49):**  higher because we're paying the farmers more than what the other dairies were. Also, our  
**[0:17:53-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:53):**  processing costs were higher because we also were brewing the milk instead of pasteurising  
**[0:17:57-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:17:57):**  it. There is a market out there, but for farmers, farmers themselves have been down the route  
**[0:18:01-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:01):**  of vending machines, which have worked very well for the local community. We were trying  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:05):**  to position ourselves slightly different. We are trying to get coverage across Scotland  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:08):**  to realise our vision of sustainable dairy. The market's there and it's a real challenge  
**[0:18:13-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:13):**  trying to compete against the conventional milk market. However, I believe that marketing  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:16):**  is starting to really get out there. People know what organic milk is and they know what  
**[0:18:21-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:21):**  misgivings stand for. I believe the market is growing and I'm really excited for where  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:25):**  this year is going to bring us. Mason, both of you are known because of your  
**[0:18:29-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:29):**  cow and calf dairy farming. I want to go into that area in a little bit more detail. David,  
**[0:18:35-0:18:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:35):**  you've been farming for 35 years. Let me take you back to the start. You've said that,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:40):**  despite some misgivings that you had about dairy farming in terms of chemical inputs  
**[0:18:44-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:44):**  and the cattle welfare, that you felt that you became desensitised to some extent.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:48):**  That the way that you farmed was just normal. It was the way it was done. But then later,  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:54):**  partly when your wife Wilma came along, but also when the farm started opening up to the public,  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:18:59):**  people started asking questions and reacting to those common dairy practices that you were  
**[0:19:04-0:19:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:04):**  talking about and that they could see on the farm. You started to feel that things had to change.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:09):**  I'm just wondering, what kind of things were the public picking up? What were they asking?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:13):**  What struck me, there was two things struck me. The first thing that struck me was how  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:18):**  disconnected the public were from farming. They had no idea what farming was at all.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:24):**  All they had was the Janet and John schoolbooks idea of farming. The farmer was a bit of straw  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:30):**  in his mouth and a couple of hens and cows and pigs and what have you. And that was the  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:35):**  perception they came to the farm with. And so they were very bemused by the whole thing.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:39):**  Because we were running, walking and farm tours on tractor and trailer every day during the summer.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:47):**  So we had a lot of people coming into contact with us. The other thing that struck me was  
**[0:19:54-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:19:54):**  the separation of cows and calves. So that was something that created a lot of angst amongst  
**[0:20:00-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:00):**  particularly women, visitors. It made me realize that, yes, this was an issue that was possibly  
**[0:20:09-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:09):**  going to become something of a problem down the road. So that's it, the idea thinking.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:15):**  And the question was always coming back to me from Wilma and from our visitor center manager,  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:19):**  why don't you leave the cows and calves to get out? My reply was, I'd be out of business in  
**[0:20:24-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:24):**  five minutes. And it was only when we came to rebuild the whole dairy that we thought,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:29):**  okay, can we do this? We went across to the Netherlands, we took the whole team across  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:33):**  and saw some Dutch guys who were smaller scale, 30, 40 cows. And they were leaving the calves on  
**[0:20:38-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:38):**  for three months, they were organic. And it saved them from rearing the calves separately.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:45):**  The downside of three months weaning was the calves went backwards very quickly because they  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:50):**  were still heavily dependent on physical and emotional contact with the cow. We realized  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:20:56):**  that that was going to be just too soon. And we knew that this had to be managed if we were going  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:00):**  to do it. We came back thinking, yeah, we could do that. And really that set us on that train.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:05):**  And we rebuilt our dairy and we built in facilities for handling the calves and cows  
**[0:21:13-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:13):**  together. And it took us four years to build the dairy because we're building most of it ourselves.  
**[0:21:19-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:19):**  So we evolved, we trialled it first in 2012 for six months, and we learned a lot from that. And  
**[0:21:26-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:26):**  that informed us for the going wholesale into the cow's calf without question. And of course,  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:34):**  it just happened to coincide because once we finished, completed that, we started making cheese  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:41):**  in small scale in our ice cream dairy. And at the same time, we thought, right, we're going to have  
**[0:21:46-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:46):**  to scale up this operation. And we started building our cheese dairy. And that took us three years.  
**[0:21:51-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:21:51):**  Luke Stirling Yes, absolutely. It's about leaving the baby calves with the mothers.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:21):**  And just for me, the reason that we went down this route was it was just at the start of the  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:35):**  time I was looking into regenerative farming. And the crux for me was that taking the concentrates  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:40):**  away from the cows and managing the grass better, but then we were still having to buy concentrates  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:45):**  in for the calves, and the calves were still not growing as well as some of the calves out there  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:49):**  they would see on our systems. I had a real interest in what David and Wilma were doing.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:53):**  At the time David and Wilma were pioneers in Scotland for Cowie Cab Daring and we were very  
**[0:22:58-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:22:58):**  lucky that we were not too far away from them. That was the reason we kind of got into it.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:02):**  Going back to the whale food of the animals, me myself when I first started the Cowie Cab thing,  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:08):**  I wasn't really doing it right. I didn't have the opportunity to go to the farms and see it.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:12):**  However, someone joined my farm two years ago, Elizabeth, and we called her the Cow Happiness  
**[0:23:17-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:17):**  Manager and that's exactly what her job is, is just to go out and make sure the cows are happy.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:21):**  She's fantastic. She's been in with the cows and calves every day. Between five and six months,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:27):**  as our weaning age, it's very calf dependent. We don't have a set date. We just kind of see  
**[0:23:31-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:31):**  how the calves are doing. It's quite different, isn't it, across different cow and calf producers?  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:37):**  And I guess that's sort of part of the question, is whether it's possible to define it.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:41):**  I suppose there is, yes. I mean, you've just touched on it there perfectly. It's like what  
**[0:23:45-0:23:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:45):**  I was saying earlier on. If you think about organic versus regenerative farming,  
**[0:23:49-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:49):**  organic is a very specific set of rules that regenerative doesn't really. And it's probably  
**[0:23:54-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:54):**  the same with cow with calf dairy. The way that David does it, the way that I do it,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:23:58):**  there could be someone who's multi-suckling four or five calves, or sorry, that's my  
**[0:24:02-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:02):**  excuse, maybe two or three calves into the same cow. And they could be calling themselves cow  
**[0:24:06-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:06):**  with calf dairies. There just isn't a certain standard out there. So I suppose every system is  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:11):**  quite different. As I mentioned, we wean between five and six months calf dependent. Others have  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:16):**  a very set date of three, four, five, six months, whatever that may be. And so perhaps that's  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:20):**  something that is needing to be looked at as a set of standards on it. And I know that David and  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:25):**  all of us are pioneering that as well through some of the research that they've done too.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:28):**  Toby  
**[0:24:29-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:29):**  It shows how important it is, doesn't it, to have these audit sort of processes.  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:32):**  And obviously, if you're selling direct to a customer and you can have a conversation  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:36):**  with the customer, the customer is able to see what you're doing and understand it.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:40):**  Whereas if you're selling, you know, even one or two steps down the line, then being able to  
**[0:24:45-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:45):**  explain and demonstrate through labelling and through the narrative on websites becomes critical.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:51):**  And obviously that then is underpinned by the organic certification that you were talking  
**[0:24:56-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:24:56):**  about. Now, Bryce, I think you've talked about the calves taking about a third of the milk.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:01):**  And, you know, with dairy margins being incredibly tight, even, you know,  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:05):**  when you're independent and you're adding value, how are you making the economics work?  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:08):**  Bryce  
**[0:25:38-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:38):**  Two pounds twenty to two pounds fifty a litre. Compile that to dairy at forty and fifty pence  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:42):**  a litre in the shelves just along the aisle from it. And you see the big difference there. So what  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:47):**  I believe was if people are willing to pay a certain amount for plant based milks because  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:52):**  they believe that that is more ethical, that's more environmental. Whatever they've been told  
**[0:25:57-0:26:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:25:57):**  from the PR and the marketing campaigns and massive companies, they are willing to pay it  
**[0:26:01-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:01):**  for that. So what I did was I calculated how much I believe that the milk was worth and how much it  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:06):**  was going to cost to produce it. I put a price out there for a pint of milk. It was almost double  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:10):**  the price of the normal organic milk that we produced but on par with the plant based milks.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:14):**  And very fortunately for me, our local community had backed us with it. People are travelling to  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:20):**  buy the gold milk that we sell. I won't lie, it's not been the easiest thing we've ever done.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:25):**  You know, there's not many people out there trying to do this in a liquid way. But every year we've  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:30):**  been supported better and better. And because we've been supported more and more, we've been  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:33):**  able to put more thoughts, more processes and more intelligent thoughts into how we feed our cows,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:39):**  how we manage the system. And we're learning all the time as well. You know, it's just trying to  
**[0:26:42-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:42):**  get milk production up but keep the ethics of what we do correct and the welfare of the animal  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:47):**  is key obviously. So yes, it's certainly getting there. But because it's only working because of  
**[0:26:51-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:51):**  this direct relationship with the consumer, the market's certainly not there yet for larger dairies  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:26:56):**  to do it in the size of their farmers. However, I believe that is coming. I believe that people  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:00):**  are looking into it and we ourselves are speaking to another dairy farm about potentially getting  
**[0:27:05-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:05):**  this route and trialling it. So you know, there's a lot of work being done out there by a lot of  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:08):**  people and it's all about having the relationship with the end user who believes in that way of  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:13):**  farming. Interesting. Now, David, I suppose, you know, when you're farming with livestock,  
**[0:27:18-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:18):**  then there's always going to be, you know, a series of trade offs, you know, some positive  
**[0:27:24-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:24):**  and some less positive between the economics and the ethics. And you talked about having  
**[0:27:29-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:29):**  experimented with cow and calf dairy in 2012. You then underwent a whole farm transition in 2016.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:38):**  And I mean, as Bryce said, your work has been hugely influential for many other independent  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:42):**  dairy producers, but it's not been an easy journey at all. And I wonder if you could briefly talk us  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:48):**  through, you know, some of the challenges that you faced on this journey. Yes, it's been challenging.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:27:54):**  The, we're still learning. I would say that the cow-calf, it sounds like a very simple thing,  
**[0:28:00-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:00):**  leave the calf with the cow, cow raise the calf, jobs are good. But it's not as simple as that,  
**[0:28:06-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:06):**  by any means. The whole dynamics of the system changed completely. I very much equate it to  
**[0:28:12-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:12):**  the transition to organic farming, which was, it was a whole system change.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:18):**  But at least with organic, there's a route map and you were doing it from scratch.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:22):**  Absolutely. Believe me, it has been quite painful at times, not just for us, the cows and calves as  
**[0:28:29-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:29):**  well. When a cow is suckling a calf, she wants to keep the best milk for the calf. So she doesn't  
**[0:28:35-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:35):**  let down the high fat milk. We get semi-skimmed milk from cows that are suckling. The cows that  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:41):**  are suckling, if there's not a bull presence in there, in the herd, you have what they call  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:47):**  lactational anestrus, which is a 30-day delay in anestrus following calving. Where if you have got  
**[0:28:53-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:28:53):**  a tight calving pattern, as we do, you can lose half the cows slipping through into a following  
**[0:29:01-0:29:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:01):**  calving groups. So the management changes, the calves, you have to be able to manage the calves  
**[0:29:07-0:29:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:07):**  because at a certain stage, once they get to about three months of age, they will drink as much milk  
**[0:29:13-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:13):**  as the cow produces. This is where the compromises start coming in. So you say, right, we'll separate  
**[0:29:19-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:19):**  the cow and calf overnight. So your layout of your buildings or your fields and tracks have to  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:26):**  accommodate that change in management. When you've got cows and calves together indoors, which we do,  
**[0:29:32-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:32):**  you have a totally different dynamic in the bacteriology and microbiology. So that we've  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:40):**  had problems with cryptosporidium, Pastorala pneumonia, but on each occasion there has been  
**[0:29:47-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:47):**  management changes that we could make that would overcome these problems. So yeah, we're blundering  
**[0:29:53-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:29:53):**  our way through the system and learning as we go. And the cows are the same because in the first six  
**[0:30:01-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:01):**  months, the cows didn't know when they came out of the parlour whether the calves were going to  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:05):**  still be there or not. So they were reluctant to leave the calf to come into the parlour. But no,  
**[0:30:11-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:11):**  it's not a problem. They're queuing in the morning to come and get milked and they know the calves  
**[0:30:15-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:15):**  are going to be there when they come back. So it's the whole relationship, the stress, the dynamics  
**[0:30:22-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:22):**  of disease and physical management and the stress with us and the staff. It's very, very depressing  
**[0:30:29-0:30:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:29):**  when you've got calves that are dying from cryptosporidium and you don't know what to do  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:32):**  about it. But when you get a problem solved, it's just so inspiring. It gives everybody a real boost.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:40):**  So this is a critical thing. Staff, absolutely key. If your staff are not interested or don't  
**[0:30:46-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:46):**  think it's going to work, it won't work. The staff really have to be on board, absolutely, because  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:53):**  the human-cow relationship is critical to this system. But yeah, every year it's getting better.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:30:59):**  Every year we see a progress. So we've got a long way to go. We're getting something like three and  
**[0:31:05-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:05):**  a half thousand litres per cow from a pasture fed, 100% pasture based diet. And they're giving around  
**[0:31:12-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:12):**  about two to two and a half thousand litres to the calf over the five months. And so that's giving us  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:18):**  a cow producing five, five and a half thousand litres of milk from forage, which is I think by  
**[0:31:23-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:23):**  any measure is a pretty good production. So that shows that the cow does respond to the management,  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:31):**  it's about us, then refining that to get the best of everybody gets the best of both worlds.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:39):**  And just to be specific, David, when you're talking about cow with calf,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:42):**  are the calves with the cows 24 hours a day until they naturally wean?  
**[0:31:47-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:47):**  No, no, no, no, no, no, we couldn't afford to do that. Three months in, roughly. So we have  
**[0:31:52-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:52):**  a fairly tight calving block, two blocks, one in the autumn, one in the spring, and that's to give  
**[0:31:56-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:31:56):**  us bounce all year round of milk supply. After three months, you must separate overnight or you  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:03):**  won't get any milk. You just won't. The cow will, some cows will give milk, but the majority will  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:08):**  not give you milk because they can hold all the milk back for the calf and the calf will drink it.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:12):**  So we separate overnight for the next couple of months. Still we're milking once a day. So it's  
**[0:32:20-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:20):**  not, it's not onerous by any means. And so you'll gain another seven or eight litres just by doing  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:28):**  that. So instantly you go from maybe down to three or four litres, you're back up into the double  
**[0:32:32-0:32:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:32):**  figures again for a while. And then by the fifth and sixth months again, the cow yield profile is  
**[0:32:39-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:39):**  dropping off and she can hold back a lot of that milk for the calf, even though they've been  
**[0:32:43-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:43):**  separated by for 12 hours. So yeah, it's about managing the system. It's a compromise. And  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:52):**  I think that, you know, the cows kind of know as well, they know it's a compromise. They know that  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:32:57):**  they've got to get a little and to get a little. We then wean the calves at five to six months.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:02):**  So the weaning process again, the whole system is based, our management system that we're evolving  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:08):**  for this setup is based around transitioning the cows, reducing stress, cutting stress out of the  
**[0:33:13-0:33:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:13):**  system. One of the several big advantages of separating overnight is A, you get more milk. B,  
**[0:33:20-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:20):**  the calf peer bond gets strengthened and you're starting to weaken the calf mother bond. Then also  
**[0:33:26-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:26):**  when the calf is 24 hours on the cow, it doesn't eat solids. So the rumen doesn't develop. So  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:33):**  overnight separation, calf gets hungry, starts eating because they've got access to their own  
**[0:33:37-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:37):**  food, their silage supply. They go and start eating forage. And so the rumen develops.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:44):**  So that when you get the five to six months, you've got a calf that physically and emotionally  
**[0:33:49-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:49):**  is prepared for separation. We then use things called quiet wean nose clips. And these are very,  
**[0:33:56-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:33:56):**  very clever little clips that pop into the nose. And it's a flap that hangs down over the top lip  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:04):**  of the calf and it can drink and eat solids and drink water. But when it reaches into the teat  
**[0:34:09-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:09):**  of the cow, the little flap pushes the teat away. It is very, very clever. It just takes seconds to  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:16):**  pop these in and we leave that in those in for a week. And by the end of that week, the calf is  
**[0:34:22-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:22):**  physically independent of the mother. We then take the clips out and we don't open the gate. And we  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:27):**  used to have a ferrari in the morning when we didn't open the gate for the first couple of days  
**[0:34:33-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:33):**  it was just deafening. But now there's just grumbling. There's grumbling, we've got the clips  
**[0:34:40-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:40):**  in, there's grumbling for a day or two. But you know, it is so quiet. It is just a trance. So  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:48):**  again, management, there is a management solution really to all the technological problems that  
**[0:34:54-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:34:54):**  we have and we don't need invasive technology. We can manage these things. So it's management  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:35:00):**  based systems is absolutely key. Fantastic. Well, thank you both so much. That's been  
**[0:35:06-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Dairy-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-euqnpg#t=0:35:06):**  really fascinating. And that's all we have time for. I'd like to thank my guests, Bryce Cunningham

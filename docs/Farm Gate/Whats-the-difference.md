### Farm Gate  (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:07:51)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finn LoKusteyn. What's the difference between agroecology  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:10):**  and regenerative agriculture? Not sure? Well then, what about holistic grazing? Organic,  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:16):**  no-till farming or AMP adaptive multi-paddock grazing? Well, in this programme we hope to  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:21):**  get to the bottom of all this terminology that now seems to be so omnipresent in the  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:26):**  nature-friendly farming Twittersphere. I'm joined by two women who are going to help  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:30):**  me slug out some definitions. From Roots of Nature we have regenerative agriculture expert  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:35):**  Caroline Grindrod and from FAI Farms we have Kelly Watson who's going to help us keep our  
**[0:00:39-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:39):**  feet on the ground. Welcome both!  
**[0:00:41-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:41):**  Hello, hi Kelly!  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:43):**  Hi!  
**[0:00:44-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:44):**  What we're going to try and do here is to tap into the incredible knowledge resource  
**[0:00:48-0:00:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:48):**  of Caroline's brain. While at the same time Kelly I want you to metaphorically sort of  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:52):**  sound the horn if you think our definitions are starting to get too theoretical so that  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:00:56):**  we can make sure that we stay rooted in practical farm management as far as possible. And just  
**[0:01:01-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:01):**  before we kind of really get started, Kelly, do the differences between these approaches  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:06):**  to nature-friendly farming really matter?  
**[0:01:09-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:09):**  For me, I'm not sure it's whether the differences matter in terms of the approaches, it's more  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:14):**  about understanding what those differences are because, you know, in your introduction  
**[0:01:18-0:01:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:18):**  to Finlow you've already talked about agroecology and regenerative agriculture and my understanding,  
**[0:01:24-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:24):**  and Caroline may put me straight on this, is agroecology is an umbrella, you know, an  
**[0:01:28-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:28):**  umbrella term for a number of different farming approaches that sit within it and regenerative  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:34):**  is one of those. So for me it's about people being able to get hold and understand these  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:39):**  terms and feel confident in what they mean. So for me you then mix in all this stuff around  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:45):**  no-till and then you put in an approach like organic. Well, where does that all sit?  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:50):**  Caroline, regenerative agriculture is clearly the gold standard so far as you're concerned.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:54):**  So what distinguishes regenerative agriculture from agroecology?  
**[0:01:58-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:01:58):**  Thanks, Finlow, and I'd be cautious about saying that I think regen's the gold standard.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:03):**  I think there's a place for, it's an ecosystem of things going on and that's quite right  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:07):**  and that's actually part of this whole concept really. So I think Kelly's absolutely right.  
**[0:02:11-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:11):**  I think agroecology is quite a broad term and I haven't come through that sort of particular  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:15):**  pathway but the way I understand it and the way I frame it is that agroecology is really  
**[0:02:20-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:20):**  the application of ecology or ecological principles and to some degree regen is one of those.  
**[0:02:25-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:25):**  So we absolutely use ecological principles for carrying out regen or being regen or getting  
**[0:02:32-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:32):**  regenerative outcomes. So that's absolutely true I think.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:34):**  So with agroecology perhaps it's a broader spectrum that takes in lots of these different  
**[0:02:41-0:02:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:41):**  approaches to nature-based agriculture where regen is one type of farming that fits within  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:48):**  that sort of agroecological spectrum. Is that fair?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:51):**  I think that's a reasonable way to describe it, yeah.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:53):**  What about the others? I mean how do holistic grazing and organic and no-till farming and  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:02:59):**  AMP fit into that sort of broader picture?  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:02):**  So my kind of lineage towards regen ag was through holistic management and we'll start  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:07):**  with that. So holistic management was developed by Alan Savory and it's a framework for managing  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:12):**  complexity. So holistic management is the framework itself and one of the procedures  
**[0:03:16-0:03:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:16):**  and processes within that framework is called holistic plant grazing. So people are often  
**[0:03:20-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:20):**  using that interchangeably and saying oh I'm using holistic management talking about grazing  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:25):**  but they're two very different things. So holistic plant grazing you definitely need  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:29):**  to use within the framework but you can use the framework to manage a hairdresser or a  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:34):**  government or anything else. So it's important to understand that distinction. So I absolutely  
**[0:03:39-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:39):**  use the framework of holistic management to do regenerative agriculture and teach regenerative  
**[0:03:44-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:44):**  agriculture. So that's how it fits together really.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:46):**  Okay so we've got there holistic management and holistic grazing being two separate terms.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:52):**  So both of them are linked to Alan Savory's work. Holistic management is something which  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:03:57):**  is much broader which is a management application that you can apply to anything whether it's  
**[0:04:02-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:02):**  a grocer's or hairdresser's or a farm business but holistic plant grazing is specifically  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:07):**  a regenerative agriculture grazing approach that's developed by Alan Savory. Organic.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:13):**  So organic again you can be regenerative and organic but organic doesn't necessarily mean  
**[0:04:19-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:19):**  that you're going to be regenerative and in fact I work with a lot of organic farmers  
**[0:04:22-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:22):**  who have set off with all of the great great intentions and then have ended up just getting  
**[0:04:27-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:27):**  derogations for worms and losing soil health and all the rest of it. So it's a set of practices  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:35):**  and sort of standards and prescriptions and protocols but it doesn't necessarily mean  
**[0:04:40-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:40):**  that you're getting regenerative outcomes.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:42):**  So that's I mean I know that this is really frustrating for you because you immediately  
**[0:04:47-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:47):**  want to get into all the detail of these different systems but just help us out with no-till  
**[0:04:54-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:04:54):**  farming and an AMP adaptive multi-paddock grazing. How do they fit into the picture?  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:00):**  Yeah so no-till is one of the practices that you might you might use within regenerative  
**[0:05:05-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:05):**  agriculture. So again it's just important to realise that the practices are not what  
**[0:05:08-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:08):**  regen is and we'll come to this later but it's about working with a set of principles  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:13):**  and more than it is about just adopting a practice. So no-till means that you're you  
**[0:05:17-0:05:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:17):**  know you're just keeping the soil covered and you're not using a plough and that is  
**[0:05:20-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:20):**  one of the practices and there is a big movement just around that and often it is a starting  
**[0:05:24-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:24):**  point to get into regen but it isn't just you know you're not necessarily regen if  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:29):**  you just adopt no-till. And AMP grazing and adaptive multi-paddock grazing I think I would  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:34):**  be right in saying that this came about Alan Williams I think originally coined the term  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:38):**  and sort of interchangeably with flex grazing and again he's evolved his thinking and his  
**[0:05:43-0:05:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:43):**  terminology now and I think he calls it adaptive stewardship. But ultimately it was really  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:47):**  I think because they wanted to start to bring some science into holistic management which  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:52):**  has always been one of the sort of sticking points that because this is context specific  
**[0:05:56-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:05:56):**  holistic management it's going to be different to each farmer. Very hard to actually fit  
**[0:06:00-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:00):**  into a reductionist science model but in trying to do that they decided that the word holistic  
**[0:06:05-0:06:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:05):**  was a barrier to some of the universities and things. They absolutely wanted to capture  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:09):**  that this is adaptive you know they wanted to say that this is more than just rotational  
**[0:06:13-0:06:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:13):**  grazing or just mob grazing and having a standard set of kind of you know moves across the farm.  
**[0:06:19-0:06:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:19):**  This is absolutely about the landowner and the farmer getting engaged with their livestock  
**[0:06:23-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:23):**  and their landscape and getting feedback from their decisions and then adapting their management  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:28):**  to fit. I'm going to just because you brought in another another term there which is mob  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:34):**  grazing and I'm just going to have to get you to define that in context of all this  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:38):**  stuff as well. And again I'm scared that we're just going to get into more and more terms  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:42):**  but there's a load as a collection of different grazing terms which vaguely mean that you  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:46):**  are putting your animals together in a group using a fence to segregate your fields and  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:50):**  then moving them around the farm in a rotation with a gap. Mob grazing is a term a catchall  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:54):**  term that's being used for anything along that spectrum.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:06:58):**  Fantastic just to summarise agroecology is a spectrum that takes in lots of different  
**[0:07:03-0:07:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:03):**  nature-based approaches to agriculture. Regen is one of those which is much more focused  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:11):**  on improving outcomes. It has an ecosystems focus. The holistic grazing specifically comes  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:17):**  from holistic management processes frameworks that were developed by Alan Savory and within  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:23):**  that then we have practices like no-till or adaptive stewardship as you were calling it  
**[0:07:30-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:30):**  or mob grazing. These are practices within that kind of bigger overarching sort of spectrum.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:36):**  I think that's a brilliant summary yeah. Okay right let's move on. So Kelly let's just  
**[0:07:41-0:07:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:41):**  park that for a moment. At FAI you're working a lot with retailers and brands. What phrases  
**[0:07:46-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:46):**  do you find people asking about most at the moment?  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:49):**  So for me the word at the moment I guess is regenerative. I think it's because people  
**[0:07:54-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:54):**  have got into the mindset I think where we were talking about sustainable before and  
**[0:07:58-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:07:58):**  sort of maintaining people are recognising that we need to do more than that and we need  
**[0:08:03-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:03):**  to have a positive impact and I think you know regenerative that word itself you know  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:09):**  does what it says on the tin kind of thing and people understand it but what I would  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:13):**  say is that from the way we speak with clients they're using sustainable and regenerative  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:20):**  sort of interchangeably. I guess I've got a slight concern in that I'm not entirely  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:25):**  sure some people have a very clear idea about what this means but others are making commitments  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:30):**  or saying they're going to use regenerative practices without actually knowing what that  
**[0:08:35-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:35):**  means on the ground and the conversation we've just had with you know Caroline sums it up  
**[0:08:39-0:08:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:39):**  for me because many of you know the way our food systems work we've got standards in place,  
**[0:08:44-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:44):**  we've got prescriptive standard place that's how you know food brands and retailers have  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:47):**  managed their supply chains. They put in a standard and then they can talk about what  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:52):**  they're doing publicly. I think from what you know as Caroline just said the practices  
**[0:08:56-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:08:56):**  in themselves don't make you regenerative. I've got a concern about people using that  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:00):**  term regenerative without really thinking about what that means in terms of change so  
**[0:09:05-0:09:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:05):**  there's a whole piece isn't there about farmers needing to change their approach and their  
**[0:09:09-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:09):**  outlook but so do our food companies. They're going to have to think about how do we change  
**[0:09:14-0:09:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:14):**  our approach to accommodate this change in system and approach so for me regenerative  
**[0:09:21-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:21):**  is the word at the moment and what I want to do is make sure that that is being used  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:26):**  in the right way and not just being used as a buzzword at the time.  
**[0:09:31-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:31):**  It's almost as though sometimes you know people just get bored with one word and they start  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:34):**  using another thinking that it essentially means the same thing and there is as you say  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:38):**  the danger that people use the word regen because they've kind of got a bit bored with  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:42):**  sustainability or it's being applied to a few too many things. It's about truly understanding  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:47):**  that it is a genuine mindset change. There are practices within regen that can help you  
**[0:09:53-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:53):**  get a bit of a sense of it on your farm but until you sort of embrace that mindset change  
**[0:09:58-0:10:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:09:58):**  you're not a regen farmer. So Caroline you've been working on a new introduction to regenerative  
**[0:10:04-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:04):**  agriculture course with the team at FAI. How are you going to how are you going about making  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:10):**  regen more accessible?  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:11):**  So again just to frame it we've come from a farming system that's come out of a kind  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:16):**  of a mechanistic worldview I suppose so since the age of enlightenment we came in and we  
**[0:10:21-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:21):**  suddenly realized that we could quantify and study and reduce and separate and understand  
**[0:10:26-0:10:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:26):**  things and that's totally right for you know anything to do with maths and physics and  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:31):**  machines and we've come through that whole kind of period of science that did things  
**[0:10:35-0:10:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:35):**  in that way and it's got a huge way forward. So but the problem is that we've applied the  
**[0:10:40-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:40):**  same thinking to living systems whether it's our bodies or whether it's an ecosystem which  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:45):**  is our landscape and that's why we've ended up with these results with degraded soils  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:50):**  and you know loss of biodiversity that's exact that's really the root cause of why that's  
**[0:10:54-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:54):**  happened is because we've been thinking about land and systems as if they're a machine so  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:10:59):**  that's absolutely at the complete heart and core of what regenerative agriculture is.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:03):**  So we've got we've got a choice we've either got to simplify it reduce it and make it more  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:08):**  accessible so that it makes people feel comfortable and then get in the door or we try and allow  
**[0:11:13-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:13):**  people to find their own way through it and then eventually they'll sort of come to a  
**[0:11:17-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:17):**  point which is getting regenerative outcomes and they understand complexity and they understand  
**[0:11:21-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:21):**  the living system and I guess as a movement we've got to work out how to navigate that  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:25):**  which is why we get into such gnarly conversations around it all. So yeah you're right we've  
**[0:11:29-0:11:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:29):**  at FAI what we've done is we've soon realised that there's such an appetite for regen in  
**[0:11:34-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:34):**  the retail world that we decided we wanted to start to build something for them so that  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:39):**  they didn't end up just kind of you know diluting it reducing it and greenwashing it and and  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:43):**  it's incredibly important because we just don't want to end up with the same mess you  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:46):**  know that's the whole point of why we got to regen. So we've come up with a kind of  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:49):**  set of ecological principles and then we are using those principles to try and improve  
**[0:11:54-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:11:54):**  the ecosystem processes. So the ecosystem processes that we use are the water cycle,  
**[0:12:00-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:00):**  the nutrient cycle, photosynthesis, airflow and then we talk about the fact we weave those  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:05):**  together with nature's dynamic networks. So we work with those ecosystem processes and  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:09):**  that's the way we can measure our outcomes and then to achieve the increase in those  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:13):**  ecosystem processes we have a set of practices and they'll vary from farm to farm and some  
**[0:12:18-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:18):**  people will invent their own practices so that could be a whole range of things you  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:23):**  know from no till that we discussed earlier through amp grazing through holistic plant  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:28):**  grazing through agroforestry through composting and ultimately you don't know if that's worked  
**[0:12:33-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:33):**  you don't know whether you are regenerative unless you've measured the outcomes which  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:36):**  is you know as I say those ecosystem processes so for the water cycle it might be we've improved  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:41):**  the infiltration rate for the nutrient cycle we can measure change in aggregates and whether  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:46):**  we've got more earthworms or whether we've got you know there's a whole range of metrics  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:50):**  we can use we can identify whether bricks is good in our plants we can use nature's  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:12:55):**  dynamic networks to measure whether we're getting problem species or disease issues  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:00):**  and red flags we call them and airflow we can sort of measure you know and as I say  
**[0:13:05-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:05):**  how good our soil structure is so.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:07):**  And those data components that you've just mentioned there that the importance of monitoring  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:12):**  is really sort of intrinsic to your process as well.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:15):**  Absolutely so there's certain things that you can say that you do in region that generally  
**[0:13:19-0:13:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:19):**  get good regenerative outcomes whether that's a living root in the soil you know do not  
**[0:13:25-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:25):**  disturb so there's various sort of guidelines that you can come in on but it's just important  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:30):**  to realize that that doesn't mean that your region just because you're doing planting  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:33):**  a cover crop and using no-till doesn't mean that you're necessarily a region the only  
**[0:13:37-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:37):**  way to prove that is whether you're getting regenerative outcomes.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:40):**  It's important not to become too purist about what that means because we want people to  
**[0:13:44-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:44):**  get on board and if all they're doing is actually following practices and they're still getting  
**[0:13:48-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:48):**  regenerative results that's a big step forward so I wouldn't want to stop that happening  
**[0:13:53-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:53):**  across you know large supply chains but it's just important to realize that there's more  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:13:56):**  to it than that and it's important to understand the bigger picture region includes making  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:01):**  sure the family is happy and healthy making sure communities are happy and healthy.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:04):**  So Kelly Caroline's just set out there three if you've got a triangle then the three points  
**[0:14:09-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:09):**  of a framework approach centered around region there's the set of principles we've got the  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:16):**  practices you know the one other corner of that triangle but then the importance of monitoring  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:21):**  because it's the outcomes that matter it's making sure those regenerative outcomes exist  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:27):**  and measuring and monitoring those outcomes that's really important and so if those are  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:31):**  the sort of things that we're talking about at farm level if we're thinking about an ordinary  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:34):**  farmer who's perhaps interested in looking at regen what do you think are likely to be  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:38):**  the easiest entry points for them?  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:40):**  I think the practices is the easiest entry point you know you can say to them if you're  
**[0:14:46-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:46):**  not disturbing the soil too much if you're you know keeping ground you know cover on  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:52):**  the ground and then you can link that I think to the stuff around water and retaining water  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:14:56):**  you know that when you have the practice and then add on top the kind of ecosystem process  
**[0:15:01-0:15:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:01):**  bit works so for me I think for farmers that practice piece is probably how to get them  
**[0:15:08-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:08):**  started isn't it now I take Caroline's point that that's not the only thing you can't just  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:12):**  do that and then expect to be regenerative so that that measuring piece and that kind  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:16):**  of wanting to take the bigger picture I think is important but I don't think we can underestimate  
**[0:15:21-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:21):**  and we've touched on it already I don't think we can underestimate how big a mindset shift  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:26):**  that entails for a farmer you know you farmed in a particular way for a particular farmer  
**[0:15:31-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:31):**  and the fact that you're even taking this step but I guess for me it would be the temptation  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:35):**  to revert back to what you know when something happens that you don't know how to deal with  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:40):**  so I don't think we can underestimate that even when you start these practices that shift  
**[0:15:46-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:46):**  is difficult you know for me when I saw the farm you know working I had in my head you  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:51):**  know what good grass looks like when it's been grazed it's uniform it's short and then  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:15:55):**  it's a shock to you when you go out and you see all these different species and you see  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:00):**  you know most people would say it looks a bit messy you know that that is a mindset  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:03):**  shift you know that you have to kind of get your head round so I think for me the practices  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:09):**  are the way in because people can kind of grasp them and you can talk to them about  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:13):**  what they're doing within that ecosystem but the mindset shift is the big one being confident  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:18):**  to stick with it I guess.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:19):**  So Caroline we've talked about the principles of Regen on the podcast in the past to some  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:24):**  degree of detail and I wonder if you can just help us out with you know reminding us briefly  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:29):**  what the main ones are and why they're important.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:32):**  Again these are not hard fast rules of nature that's that's not a thing but we define it  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:37):**  by saying the seven sort of generally applicable principles in nature that we want to try and  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:42):**  bring into our farming system we work with networks it's really to the point that nature  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:46):**  is a network of interconnected living systems what you do to one part of it will affect  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:49):**  another part so this is the kind of the holism piece and that we absolutely need to sort  
**[0:16:54-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:54):**  of understand and work within in our regenerative systems.  
**[0:16:57-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:16:57):**  The next one is energy sunlight is the fundamental source of energy that drives all ecological  
**[0:17:02-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:02):**  cycles so you know everything in our system whether it's a lettuce leaf or you know an  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:07):**  animal has come from sunlight being converted in a plant at the soil surface so that's kind  
**[0:17:12-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:12):**  of absolutely you know critical to the understanding of how these things work and we can't increase  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:16):**  our output without using inputs obviously unless we increase our photosynthetic capacity  
**[0:17:22-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:22):**  so we work a lot with that.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:24):**  Cycles important to understand that water and nutrients cycle continuously through a  
**[0:17:27-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:27):**  living system so we don't generate waste in a living system so we mimic the you know improve  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:32):**  the water cycle the retention of water and make sure that's being utilized by plants  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:37):**  not running off across the surface and into our streams and nutrients we don't want to  
**[0:17:41-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:41):**  be getting them through adding fertilizers we want to be able to use a living system  
**[0:17:44-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:44):**  that recycles its nutrients properly and can actually get you know get the the nutrients  
**[0:17:49-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:49):**  out of the rock so it's continually able to provide what the plants need and our animals  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:55):**  and then relationships there's unlimited number of relationships interrelationships they're  
**[0:17:59-0:18:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:17:59):**  all interconnected and woven together so we need to understand that and be willing to  
**[0:18:02-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:02):**  work with the exchange energy and again it's back to this point that the you know the output  
**[0:18:07-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:07):**  of a whole system is greater than the sum of its parts actually you know when you've  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:12):**  got more mycorrhizal fungi in the soil you can tap into more nutrients it's not so much  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:16):**  competition for nutrients it means that we can actually explore more of the soil and  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:20):**  we're buffering temperatures we're buffering moisture so that we're getting more production  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:25):**  out of the system and then diversity is another principle all ecosystems derive stability  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:31):**  and resilience through the richness of diversity so yeah absolutely it's about we need to be  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:36):**  able to add things rather than remove things so rather than test or a disease and how can  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:41):**  we kill that and or how can we kill that in a slightly less toxic way which we might think  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:45):**  of in perhaps some organic systems we're thinking about what's it telling us and how can we  
**[0:18:50-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:50):**  advance you know the the diversity and increase the the connectants of that system so that  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:56):**  we're not getting these booms and busts in population that are really causing us the  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:18:59):**  problems in agriculture and adaptation is another big one an ecosystem is flexible an  
**[0:19:03-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:03):**  ever fluctuating network that adapts to its environment so in our systems we need to learn  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:08):**  to be adaptive we need to be in a conversation with the land all the time and the animals  
**[0:19:12-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:12):**  and looking out for what's happening and then responding to it not sticking to a pattern  
**[0:19:16-0:19:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:16):**  or a plan and then succession which is really about ecological succession which is how nature  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:21):**  turns bare rock into a forest it likes to build and add and expand in complexity all  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:26):**  the time and it's really important to understand that every species has a niche in that ecosystem  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:32):**  it likes a stage of succession more than another so if you've got a problem species whether  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:36):**  it's a rush or a thistle it's because you've created the conditions and the point of succession  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:40):**  it likes so it's our job to understand how to increase complexity to get past that point  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:45):**  so we're seeing the plants we want and not the plants and diseases that we don't want  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:49):**  a lot of specific principles there and and what i'm kind of getting in mind while you  
**[0:19:54-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:19:54):**  go through that list is that for a lot of farmers when they make the transition within  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:01):**  a year or two their farms are going to look very different and so the mindset shift isn't  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:05):**  just it's not just something that's happening internally it's something that's visual this  
**[0:20:09-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:09):**  is why we can't use plans and prescriptions because every time you advance your soils  
**[0:20:16-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:16):**  in succession they're going to respond differently so you'll get different plants coming up every  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:19):**  year and your animals will perform differently from year to year depending on what plants  
**[0:20:23-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:23):**  are warm so we need to be able to make new decisions every step of the way depending  
**[0:20:28-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:28):**  on what's happening in our outside environment so it's absolutely the case that the farmer  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:32):**  needs to learn how to become part of their environment so it's in tune and is responding  
**[0:20:37-0:20:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:37):**  to it rather than simply being on the outside imposing you know a set of standards or and  
**[0:20:42-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:42):**  prescriptions kelly we've just gone through that list so that we've got you know the ecosystem  
**[0:20:47-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:47):**  processes i've made my notes here sort of networks and holism with sunlight uh productivity  
**[0:20:52-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:52):**  photosynthesis water and nutrient cycling energy exchange relationships between things  
**[0:20:58-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:20:58):**  diversity adaptation succession do you think there are areas that are more challenging  
**[0:21:03-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:03):**  to explain to to conventional farmers interested in making the transition yeah i think we i  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:10):**  think we've got a job to do haven't we around around the communication of it because you  
**[0:21:14-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:14):**  want people to engage with it and so i guess for me we don't want it to sound so big just  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:19):**  listening to caroline there going through those you know principles obviously it was  
**[0:21:23-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:23):**  the bit at the end that i really kind of went oh yeah okay we want our activity to be part  
**[0:21:28-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:28):**  of the ecosystem you know our the way farming's evolved i guess we have we sit on the outside  
**[0:21:33-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:33):**  and look in and we set stuff aside for nature but actually what we're saying is we want  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:38):**  what we do to be accepted as part of a natural system if we're not careful we make it sound  
**[0:21:44-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:44):**  so so big that people don't feel that they can tackle it and i understand caroline's  
**[0:21:50-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:50):**  point that we don't want to simplify it down to such a state that people just think you  
**[0:21:54-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:54):**  can tick a box and it's done but i also think there's stuff around you know the tone that  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:21:58):**  we use and presenting the opportunities because one thing we haven't talked about here is  
**[0:22:03-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:03):**  you know caroline mentions productivity but productivity you know we're not saying you're  
**[0:22:07-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:07):**  going to go regen and you're going to have to accept a yield drop we know we're not saying  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:10):**  that and i think we need to make that clear too you know the fact that you haven't got  
**[0:22:14-0:22:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:14):**  the inputs you know would naturally make people think oh my goodness you know i'm not going  
**[0:22:18-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:18):**  to get the return but if i understand correctly if you're working in a regenerative system  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:23):**  then you don't have to accept that your productivity is going to be low for example this isn't  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:29):**  just about the planet this is about you and your business and actually you know ultimately  
**[0:22:34-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:34):**  you know you could be operating a much better business on the back of it and just on that  
**[0:22:38-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:38):**  productivity point i guess again it's about focusing on what productivity really means  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:43):**  because if you've got a farm which is you know which is greatly overstocked and you're  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:47):**  bringing in loads of inputs from outside then then transitioning that farm to a regenerative  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:52):**  system is going to be quite different from a farm that is more or less stocked right  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:22:56):**  but is managing things in a conventional way that's then transitioning to regen because  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:01):**  at that point you are likely to see quite a rapid boost in productivity you're absolutely  
**[0:23:06-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:06):**  right though it's a really good point and we've just started pinning this down actually  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:09):**  and we started sort of screaming it like you know we need to redefine productivity if you  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:15):**  focus in on one element of production like your biomass production from your grass or  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:21):**  your dry matter or weight gains or whatever that is or milk output or whatever you lose  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:26):**  sight of the whole system and again kelly's point is really important that you know we  
**[0:23:30-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:30):**  have to then understand that we're part of this whole system so okay we may not be getting  
**[0:23:35-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:35):**  in a month if you took a month snapshot we might not get in that month the same productivity  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:39):**  output in terms of dry matter but if you take the whole year the the fact that you've buffered  
**[0:23:45-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:45):**  rainfall so you're not going into drought or you're not flooding and saturating the  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:48):**  soils or the animals are healthy and happy and getting shade and shelter and are picking  
**[0:23:53-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:53):**  the right nutrients that they need to then unlock these other plants overall the whole  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:23:57):**  system is going to be more productive and you may be able to completely drop your fertilizer  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:01):**  bill and you may be able to reduce your medication bill down so that's the really key point and  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:05):**  as you say pinlove it's not just a simple thing where increasing output it's about okay  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:09):**  well are we doing that without all of those ghost acres because essentially a hundred  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:14):**  acre farm could produce something equivalent to a 300 acre farm that buys in enough grain  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:18):**  so it's making that distinction as in it and making sure that we're yeah we call it redefining  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:22):**  productivity and through all of that you know i'm just reminded of this phrase that you  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:27):**  know i've heard you know variously over the last few years which is you know that the  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:31):**  way that we've approached farming over the last few decades is is to be able to farm  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:35):**  despite nature and what we're talking about here is changing to a system where we're recruiting  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:40):**  nature to work for us where they're we can reduce our inputs because nature's doing it  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:45):**  on our behalf where we can reduce the costs because nature's becoming the staff and and  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:50):**  they're sort of working for us on the farm absolutely and in rewilding you know i work  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:55):**  a lot with conservation organizations and that's the same problem you know they in some  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:24:59):**  circles of conservation and wilding they think that people just should just get out of the  
**[0:25:02-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:02):**  way because nature so-called nature can do a better job on its own but they forget that  
**[0:25:07-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:07):**  we are absolutely intrinsically part of nature and we're missing a lot of the key predators  
**[0:25:11-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:11):**  and processes that will be happening in a pristine environment so really we've got an  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:15):**  opportunity to take up that role ourselves as keystone species and say right we need  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:20):**  to understand how to work with these principles of ecology because we need to step into that  
**[0:25:25-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:25):**  system and start to run it you know so it's it's working well  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:28):**  so caroline the data monitoring aspect i'd like to come back to now your approach is  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:33):**  centered on core ecosystem processes which are at the heart of regenerative agriculture  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:39):**  i wonder if you can give us some examples of the kind of outcomes that you think are  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:43):**  really important and the sort of monitoring monitoring and data that you have in mind  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:47):**  yeah and again everyone's going to have a different approach so savory's got ecological  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:50):**  outcome verification which is a proper certification based on what have you managed to achieve  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:55):**  and it defines its for ecosystem processes slightly differently but the way that we've  
**[0:25:59-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:25:59):**  done it for fei is um we actually monitored a huge range of data sets and for the reason  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:06):**  that we want to understand which are the best proxies because we want to ultimately find  
**[0:26:10-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:10):**  something that's extremely easy to pick up by a farmer and gets the job done again a  
**[0:26:14-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:14):**  lot of the problem with some of the more technical end of region you know where it's going down  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:18):**  that kind of analyzing soils and getting super technical about your monitoring is it's putting  
**[0:26:22-0:26:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:22):**  a lot of people off so it's trying to find that middle ground which is giving you the  
**[0:26:26-0:26:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:26):**  feedback you need but the actual process of getting your hands in the soil itself is as  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:30):**  kelly says it starts to advance your thinking about yourself as part of the system so that's  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:35):**  important too so we've come up we monitor a huge range of things and i can't go into  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:39):**  them all but for instance in the water cycle we're suggesting that some key measurement  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:43):**  tools could be infiltration rates um so how quickly can the rainfall actually get into  
**[0:26:48-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:48):**  your soil and how is you know how effectively is it held in there and that's just kind of  
**[0:26:52-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:52):**  almost like usually there's a sort of chimney experiment isn't there where you stick the  
**[0:26:56-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:26:56):**  chimney on the on the soil pour in some water and see how quickly it drains exactly so we've  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:00):**  got hydrophobic soils that are repelling water because of what we've done to them so and  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:05):**  also we're creating capping that means that all of that rainfall is running off in them  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:09):**  and going into drought and we're booming and busting and drought and floods so good infiltration  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:14):**  is one of the indicators that suggests that we've you know got better soil health and  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:18):**  we can retain water so that we can feed our plants better throughout the season and we  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:23):**  could record biomass production over over a year so we could say whether that's in animal  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:27):**  days or dry matter we could say that over the year we buffered the system so that it  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:33):**  then is producing more consistently throughout the year so we take that over a wider span  
**[0:27:38-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:38):**  so there's a couple things the nutrient cycle and we might measure carbon again and carbon's  
**[0:27:43-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:43):**  important but it's becoming the next hook that everyone jumps onto we have to be cautious  
**[0:27:49-0:27:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:49):**  carbon is one of the things that's important.  
**[0:27:51-0:27:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:51):**  And how would you measure carbon what's the what's the best sort of the cheapest and most  
**[0:27:55-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:55):**  effective way of measuring carbon?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:27:58):**  What we've done and again this is a huge topic in its own right with much debate we are using  
**[0:28:03-0:28:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:03):**  loss on ignition and we're going down to 50 centimetres there's now some evidence that  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:07):**  carbon sequester much deeper than we thought if you had enough money we'd go down to a  
**[0:28:10-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:10):**  metre but we don't so 50 centimetres seems accessible we take it in three different zones  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:17):**  through that you know zero to ten ten to thirty thirty to fifty centimetres and we also do  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:22):**  bulk density so that we can work out stocks at a later date so we would we'd basically  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:26):**  work out you burn that sample it works out how much you know organic matter and how much  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:31):**  organic carbon you've got in there so that's how we would do the carbon.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:35):**  What about things like worm counts and so on are they are they really good indicators?  
**[0:28:39-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:39):**  We've got worm counts under yeah so part of the nutrient cycle we might look at worm counts  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:43):**  again on its own isn't a good enough measure because depending on your how far along the  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:48):**  scale of bacteria to fungi you get in the ratios you'll get different worms in different  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:52):**  environments so but it's it builds a picture that's what's important we're building a picture  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:28:56):**  we could measure the nutrient quality of the porridge so you can do soil analysis and there's  
**[0:29:00-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:00):**  people that are doing incredibly detailed soil analysis but you've got to be very cautious  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:04):**  there to understand that we're not after soluble nutrients here what we want is available nutrients  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:09):**  that are complexed into organic compounds so just the standard soil test is not a good  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:14):**  indicator of soil health in fact in some respects you could say that in a natural system nature  
**[0:29:19-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:19):**  wouldn't allow very soluble nutrients just be floating around in the you know in the  
**[0:29:23-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:23):**  pool basically and it would be complexed into organisms and soil structures so it's very  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:28):**  complicated we can't really go into it here but ultimately yes we can do very detailed  
**[0:29:33-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:33):**  soil analysis and we do do we are doing that in the chemistry we are monitoring the biology  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:38):**  so we have fungi and bacteria predators of the system and the ratios of those and we're  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:43):**  coming up the system to make sure are we are those nutrients actually getting into our  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:46):**  plants so we're monitoring the plants nutrient levels and we're also doing blood tests and  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:50):**  hair samples on the on the animals so we can say okay it's in the plants but is it getting  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:54):**  into the animals or is there things locking up that system i wouldn't expect average you  
**[0:29:58-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:29:58):**  know farms to need to do that so what we tend to do is use soil mentor for the structures  
**[0:30:02-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:02):**  because it's physical structures and soil are a bit of an indicator of proxy and earthworms  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:06):**  is part of that so there's a whole range of different things that you're monitoring there  
**[0:30:10-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:10):**  different outcomes that you're looking at you know all you know all associated with  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:14):**  those those key principles that you were mentioning if farmers are interested in moving towards  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:19):**  regen but they're not yet ready to make that kind of big leap what would you say are the  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:24):**  most important if you had to pick out three or four indicators that they ought to start  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:29):**  monitoring straight away even before doing anything else to get it to start getting a  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:35):**  sense of where they are what would they be do you think mine would be the aggregation  
**[0:30:39-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:39):**  of the soil so that vests assessment of the soil structure it would be plant density on  
**[0:30:44-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:44):**  the soil surface you know how much bare soil have you got and how many plants have you  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:47):**  got grown and water infiltration i think those three would get you quite a long way and it's  
**[0:30:53-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:53):**  certainly not all of it and two of those at least are ones that the farmers can do without  
**[0:30:57-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:30:57):**  spending any money at all um you know they all they could achieve was getting them to  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:01):**  go and do that on the land it would make a big difference i'm sure fantastic kelly some  
**[0:31:06-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:06):**  of the information that caroline's talking about monitoring there just you know some  
**[0:31:09-0:31:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:09):**  of it seems to be really quite straightforward common sense to me and i wonder to what extent  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:14):**  this information is already being collected by farmers or being required by um supply  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:18):**  chains i think there is a lot of data you know that's recorded but to caroline's point  
**[0:31:24-0:31:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:24):**  you know for examples farms may be soil testing but that's not necessarily for what we need  
**[0:31:30-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:30):**  to do when we're looking for a renewable outcome so i mean i think for me there's some really  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:36):**  nice entry level points there for farmers this infiltration test earthworm counts or  
**[0:31:42-0:31:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:42):**  you know these are quite bare cut looking at bare ground to me seems a nice way to get  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:47):**  people started which doesn't involve expensive testing and just gets people thinking so you  
**[0:31:53-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:53):**  know i think it would be unfair of me to say that farmers aren't testing and aren't looking  
**[0:31:57-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:31:57):**  at these things but i'm not sure in the context that we need to measure regeneration if you  
**[0:32:03-0:32:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:03):**  like i'm not sure that i'm not sure many people would be at that stage but i think there's  
**[0:32:07-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:07):**  good entry level ways to get people started i guess there's there's one final thing that  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:13):**  we just ought to get into because i think there's a sense you know if you're a conventional  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:16):**  farmer and you're thinking about regen there's a question of whether you're going to have  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:19):**  to spend thousands of pounds on consultants so that you sort of properly understand this  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:24):**  this shift this big mindset shift and land shift that we're talking about so just to  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:28):**  give us a sense of the costs caroline are people really going to have to spend thousands  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:32):**  of pounds on consultants no i think like all of this stuff we've talked about there's lots  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:36):**  of different ways you can come at this and and you can do an awful lot by just starting  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:40):**  to read things like you know alan savory's holistic management book and there's a hundred  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:45):**  really brilliant regen books out there and that in its own right will start you thinking  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:50):**  in a different way and understanding different practices and seeing all of this stuff come  
**[0:32:54-0:32:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:54):**  to life you know so actually just getting to busy reading and youtubing is a great place  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:32:59):**  to get going and some people depending on where you start depends on how far that'll  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:04):**  get you um you know that might get you all the way and but if you feel that you know  
**[0:33:08-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:08):**  you want to you know work with somebody in particular or you like a particular approach  
**[0:33:12-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:12):**  then you know it's really good to do what i almost think there's a good to do a foundations  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:16):**  course so we do one in wilder culture we're building one with fa fa savory does the foundations  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:22):**  or everyone calls it something different but essentially it's like a big immersion of two  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:27):**  or three days where you really get into the into the nitty-gritty of it you start to develop  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:32):**  that different mindset you're surrounded by people that are thinking in the same way and  
**[0:33:36-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:36):**  it massively helps you get started and i suppose that there's different ways of approaching  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:41):**  these costs as well because you know if it's an individual farmer taking on the cost of  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:46):**  doing that course for two or three days then you know that's going to cost a few hundred  
**[0:33:49-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:49):**  pounds but but if people get in touch with their aombs or their local nfu or nfu mutual  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:33:55):**  then it might be that they can persuade those organizations to put on these trainings and  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:00):**  then you know lots of farmers can club together or lots of farmers can can can take part in  
**[0:34:05-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:05):**  this training at the same time and benefit from that sort of group approach yeah absolutely  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:09):**  i mean if you want to get a consultant to come in privately due to you that's going  
**[0:34:12-0:34:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:12):**  to cost a lot of money and consultants will be upwards of you know probably 400 500 600  
**[0:34:17-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:17):**  pounds depending on who you go to and what they what they do or you can go to group training  
**[0:34:23-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:23):**  which is going to be you know i don't know three four five hundred pounds for the three  
**[0:34:26-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:26):**  days probably and then you can always ask for consultancy help in addition but it's  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:30):**  just important to realize that in these types of approaches consultants don't work like  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:35):**  the conventional agricultural consultants they don't come into a report and then you follow  
**[0:34:38-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:38):**  it quite the opposite they train you in the principles and the approach they help you  
**[0:34:42-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:42):**  and facilitate you in that learning journey i might give you some ideas but it's it you  
**[0:34:47-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:47):**  come at it a different way so you know for under a couple of thousand pounds of of good  
**[0:34:51-0:34:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:51):**  training and support you could definitely get to the point where you could probably  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:34:55):**  if you're in a very conventional system of any size save yourself many thousands of pounds  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:00):**  over the years and depending on your scale and what you're doing you know so again it's  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:05):**  about slightly just looking at the big picture of what you might be able to achieve if you  
**[0:35:09-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:09):**  do this and but without really you know without knowing that you you don't you really don't  
**[0:35:13-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:13):**  have to go and do some sort of 11-day cost you know you can start at any point and work  
**[0:35:18-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:18):**  with what's available and i guess that that message that um you know it may well be that  
**[0:35:23-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:23):**  it's uh you know it's it's a thousand pounds or a couple of thousand pounds investment  
**[0:35:26-0:35:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:26):**  over time but you are likely to save a lot of money through reduced inputs um over the  
**[0:35:32-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:32):**  course of those first few years you mean and in perpetuity as a result and so really it's  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:38):**  a relatively small investment to build your productivity and reduce your costs quite significantly  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:44):**  i'm not one to go out and say you'll be able to double your productivity that because as  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:47):**  we've discussed it depends on what your inputs are etc but you can become much more resilient  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:52):**  so you're not stressing all the time about the price of this and that and you know and  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:35:57):**  that you know roughly you've got a business plan that works every year regardless of what's  
**[0:36:00-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:00):**  happening in the outside world and that you can get rid of a huge number of your inputs  
**[0:36:04-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:04):**  and it'll get better over time so the point is you're making you know what profit you  
**[0:36:08-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:08):**  make is is profit it's not just uh you know you can get rid of all of those unpleasant  
**[0:36:13-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:13):**  costs that are that happen to be really bad for the environment on the whole as well fantastic  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:17):**  kelly any final thoughts no i just think it's been it's been so interesting but today but  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:22):**  i guess it's it is it's for me it's that bit about when you understand the what it is it's  
**[0:36:26-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:26):**  the how and the where so how do you start and where do you start and i think yeah you  
**[0:36:31-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:31):**  know that's that's what we need to get to isn't it fantastic it's a difficult topic  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:35):**  and i i think today we've made a pretty good stab at trying to shine some light on the  
**[0:36:39-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:39):**  difference between those systems you know at the outset um all of which aim to help  
**[0:36:44-0:36:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Whats-the-difference-eskuhm#t=0:36:44):**  farmers work more closely with nature but then you know through the rest of the program

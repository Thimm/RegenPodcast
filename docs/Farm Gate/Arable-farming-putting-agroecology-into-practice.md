### Farm Gate  (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 10:35:13)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. This is the third programme in a series in  
**[0:00:10-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:10):**  which I talk to farmers delivering agro-ecological agriculture on their farms. Today we're talking  
**[0:00:16-0:00:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:16):**  all things arable and I'm joined by two inspirational farmers putting agroecology into practice.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:22):**  George Young farms at Fobbing Farm in Essex and Johnny Balfour is from Balburnie Farm  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:27):**  in Fife. The farmers in this series are working with the Soil Association as Agroecology Ambassadors  
**[0:00:32-0:00:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:32):**  and as part of the Soil Association's 10 Years for Agroecology project. The series has also  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:37):**  been inspired by the Food Farming and Countryside Commission's work on farming for change. Welcome  
**[0:00:42-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:42):**  both.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:43):**  Hello Luke.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:44):**  Hi there, nice to be here.  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:45):**  George, can I start with you? You came back to the family farm seven years ago and not  
**[0:00:49-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:49):**  overly excited at the prospect. Now it's your passion, your heart and soul is in the very  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:55):**  soil. What changed?  
**[0:00:57-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:57):**  Well frightening enough it's actually approaching eight years now and I really don't know where  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:00):**  the time has gone. I mean essentially my previous life was working in banking in London and  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:05):**  essentially that job just wasn't doing it for me anymore. I was working really long  
**[0:01:08-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:08):**  hours and I just assumed that the farming life would be better but I never assumed it  
**[0:01:13-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:13):**  would really kind of get into my bones quite the way that it has. And essentially when  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:17):**  I came home we were a very conventional farm, growing three crops, mint hill but with sun  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:21):**  ploughing. And I went and visited a farmer quite early on with my agronomist, a guy called  
**[0:01:26-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:26):**  Simon Cowell who I'm sure a lot of people have heard of, an exceptional farmer who's  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:29):**  only about 40 minutes away from me. And he was doing zero till farming so he'd stopped  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:34):**  his cultivating. And it was just the beginning of me thinking about farming in a more ecological  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:39):**  sort of way. And I started seeing, I saw the changes that he'd managed to get on his farm.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:44):**  We made those same changes here on the farm and dropped insecticides and at that point  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:49):**  seeing the amazing uptick in biodiversity just beginning to happen. And all of a sudden  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:54):**  it really flipped my mindset on what farming could be. It wasn't just kind of farming in  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:59):**  a broad scale across every acre and you could really start looking at it in a different  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:03):**  light. Yeah, that little kind of tiny bit of an idea right from that start has then  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:07):**  exploded into the nature-based approach that I'm taking now.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:10):**  Jonny, you're on a similar journey. You took on the family farm three years ago I think.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:22):**  I suppose I was fascinated by regenerative agriculture having read George Monbiot's book  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:29):**  Feral along with Alan Savory's book Foundations in Holistic Management. They are a very unusual  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:36):**  pairing and I saw the similarities in what they were proposing in terms of managed and  
**[0:02:43-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:43):**  unmanaged environments. But that both of those people are proposing a difference in land  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:51):**  management that I wanted to try and replicate on our farm.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:56):**  Just thinking about those two people that you've talked about as your inspiration. George  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:00):**  Monbiot has been roundly anti-ruminant and Alan Savory, you know, ruminants are absolutely  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:06):**  at the centre of what he talks about. So I wonder what it is, what it was about what  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:11):**  George Monbiot was saying that somehow connected for you the dots across to Alan Savory's work.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:18):**  It was reading about the Yellowstone National Park and the way that they used the impact  
**[0:03:24-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:24):**  of wolves to move the ruminants in the park around. I took that as what about in our managed  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:33):**  landscape we don't want wolves in Glenrothas and Fife. That would be ridiculous. But what  
**[0:03:39-0:03:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:39):**  we do have are fences. So managing our animals in a way that brings life back to the soil  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:48):**  is something that is I think both Alan Savory and George Monbiot are basically the same.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:54):**  My memory of that Yellowstone story is that the wolves in the way that they herded and  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:01):**  managed the deer, I think in particular in that situation, it completely changed the  
**[0:04:06-0:04:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:06):**  landscape. It changed the way that the land was producing, the way the land was growing,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:11):**  but it also changed the shape of rivers. It sort of reordered to natural chaos and reordered  
**[0:04:17-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:17):**  it. And you're talking about fencing and that sort of thing there. Do you think it's possible  
**[0:04:20-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:20):**  to kind of not only recreate some of those systems, but allow that natural chaos to shape  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:25):**  itself in some way?  
**[0:04:27-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:27):**  On a very small scale, I feel that rewilding is a spectrum and that we can wild little  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:36):**  bits of hedgerows or beetle banks in the middle of fields, little pockets of woodland. I feel  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:44):**  that the large scale landscape regeneration that happened in Yellowstone isn't going to  
**[0:04:50-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:50):**  happen in the middle of Fife. It's not going to happen in the middle of Essex either. And  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:55):**  that's fine because we live in a different part of the world, but still in anything we  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:01):**  can do that increases diversity is a good thing and I want to do more of it.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:06):**  Fantastic. George, for you particularly, I think the wildlife seems to be absolutely  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:10):**  at the centre of everything that you're doing with substantial portions of your farm managed  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:15):**  with wildlife in mind. How much of your farm would you say is actively designed for wildlife?  
**[0:05:19-0:05:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:19):**  Well, I mean, this is very much the design that I'm beginning to put across the farm  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:24):**  now. So kind of the project that happened this winter just gone is my agroforestry trial  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:28):**  within one field. So that's within a 50 acre field. And I'm really kind of concentrating  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:33):**  on the farm where I live at the moment to kind of design what I'm hoping is a kind of  
**[0:05:37-0:05:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:37):**  model of how farming can really interact with nature. So the overall aim is to have a system  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:43):**  where you've got sort of about 40% of the farm somewhere between 35 and 40% in permanent  
**[0:05:48-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:48):**  organic cover. Now that doesn't mean that that's just left to do its own thing. Some  
**[0:05:53-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:53):**  of that is harvestable, some of it is more harvestable than others. But critically, it's  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:57):**  in perennial cropping, potentially some trees and shrubs, but new real kind of places that  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:02):**  wildlife can navigate the farm safely without risk of predation. The simple thing to break  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:07):**  it down as is around about 10% of my farm will be in something that I'm calling a wild  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:12):**  scene. And we've actually got the start of this in quite advanced form in between kind  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:17):**  of a couple of seawalls on our farm. And that was kind of the inspiration of what I want  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:22):**  this wild scene to look like through the middle of my farm. And at the moment, I'm just kind  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:25):**  of bodily using one of the stewardship schemes to kind of map that seam out that runs through  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:30):**  the middle of the farm. So that's sort of 10%. But then the next sort of 25 to 30% is  
**[0:06:35-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:35):**  utilizing field margins. So the field margins are kind of like a semi wild field margin.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:41):**  So they will be somewhat harvested, but not wholly harvested. So maybe we're going to  
**[0:06:45-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:45):**  end up harvesting at the beginning, we might be harvesting 70 or 80% of the stuff that  
**[0:06:49-0:06:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:49):**  I'm planting in there. So these are things like fruit bushes, and there are some fruit  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:53):**  trees and nut trees in those areas. But as those areas kind of wild up and scrub out,  
**[0:06:58-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:58):**  I'm going to harvest less and less. So it might be only harvested at 20 or 30% from  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:02):**  that area. And they are mainly that kind of wildlife corridor and transportation route.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:07):**  But then kind of we've got 20 to 25% is sitting in these agroforestry belts running across  
**[0:07:12-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:12):**  the fields. So these are the really key thing to ensure that you end up having much smaller  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:17):**  manageable chunks of land which are not particularly wide. So I've gone for a maximum width of  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:21):**  36 meters so that insects can get out into the middle of every single bit of potentially  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:26):**  monoculture land. And those those bits of agroforestry are going to have a much higher  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:31):**  rate of harvest. They're going to be much closer to being farmed, but I'm not going  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:35):**  to be too bothered if I don't harvest anything. I'd much rather my trees exhibit more natural  
**[0:07:40-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:40):**  behavior, potentially be taller than they'd otherwise be. I don't want to prune them really  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:44):**  heavily. I want that to be much more naturally focused. And if we lose some of the fruit  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:48):**  and it drops on the floor, then so be it.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:49):**  Jason Vale, Director of Agroforestry,  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:57):**  And the structures and why regenerative and why agroecology. So could I just ask you both  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:02):**  to describe a little bit about what you farm, how much land you have available so that people  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:08):**  listening can get a sense of who you are as farmers and then it's easier to kind of layer  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:12):**  on top what it is you're actually doing with that land. So Johnny, can you go first?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:16):**  Johnny  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:23):**  We're based in Fife in Scotland. We manage about 1300 hectares of arable land, pasture,  
**[0:08:28-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:28):**  little bit of hill and forestry.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:29):**  Jason Vale, Director of Agroforestry,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:30):**  And we're particularly thinking about cereals today, the arable sort of aspect. Where do  
**[0:08:33-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:33):**  your products, what are you producing? What specifically are you producing and where do  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:36):**  they go? Who are your customers?  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:37):**  Johnny  
**[0:08:38-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:38):**  So we're very lucky having very local customers for our arable produce. We have wheat, barley,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:46):**  and oats, beans and carrots are our main crops and we let land out for potatoes, cabbages,  
**[0:08:55-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:55):**  cauliflowers. The barley all goes for malting. This year mostly went to Alawa, which is 25  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:03):**  miles away. The oats, we're very lucky, five miles down the road, we have Quaker oats.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:08):**  So that's where they all go. The wheat, lots of it goes to Diageo, which is five miles  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:13):**  down the road the other way.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:14):**  Jason Vale  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:15):**  So you were growing for Quaker oats and the barley and the wheat, they were different  
**[0:09:18-0:09:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:18):**  companies, but they're essentially distilling companies of one kind or another. So George,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:22):**  just coming to you, what are you, what do you farm?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:24):**  George  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:25):**  Yeah, so I'm in South Essex. We're on about 1200 acres overall. The farm I'm really concentrating  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:30):**  on doing a lot of my trial work and trial kind of formation of how I want to farm is  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:35):**  on the 650 acres at home. And we're growing, we're still growing commodity crops. So we're  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:41):**  still growing reasonably standard wheat, beans and peas. But on top of that, we're also,  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:47):**  we're growing heritage wheat. So I've got a big old diverse range of heritage wheats  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:51):**  and then buckwheat, which I grow for Hodmedod, lentils, which also goes to that home, hemp,  
**[0:09:58-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:58):**  I've been playing around with a little bit, linseed, and we're doing a little trial of  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:02):**  flax for some linen this year as well. We also have some cows on herbal leaves.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:07):**  Jason Vale  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:08):**  And you're also thinking of going a step further, aren't you, with your milling wheat in particular  
**[0:10:10-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:10):**  where you're going to be producing your own flour, even your own bread?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:14):**  George  
**[0:10:15-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:15):**  My whole goal is to get to a place where I don't have any commodity crops anymore. I  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:20):**  am growing specifically for a localistic market and where I absolutely know for sure that  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:26):**  my crops are destined for food, you know, food with a capital F essentially. The heritage  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:30):**  wheats I've got, they will all be going through my flour mill, which I'm just in the final  
**[0:10:34-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:34):**  stages of setting up at the moment. And this partly came about because when you grow small  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:38):**  quantities of anything, if it can't go out in a 29 ton bulkier, like most of our crops  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:44):**  do at the moment, if it can't go out in that sort of quantity, if you've only grown say  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:47):**  four or five ton of it, and where I am in the southeast, there aren't many small mills  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:52):**  that can manage that small quantity, you know, without you'd get it all milled at once and  
**[0:10:56-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:56):**  then you've got a load of product with a shelf shelf life to get rid of. So it made much  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:59):**  more sense to take control of that processing element of my supply chain so that I can kind  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:04):**  of process and sell directly into bakeries. And then potentially, and this is the project  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:08):**  I'm working on at the moment, is to then actually even have a bakery on the farm to really kind  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:12):**  of control the fact that I'm not only growing a fantastic product without any pesticides  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:17):**  or fertilisers, I'm then milling it, not putting any additives into that what's being milled,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:22):**  and then getting the opportunity to bake with it and produce hugely nutritious food out  
**[0:11:26-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:26):**  at the other end.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:27):**  One of the challenges with this series is that we've kind of divided the programmes  
**[0:11:40-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:40):**  to move away from monocultures and embrace diversity and you both integrate livestock  
**[0:11:56-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:56):**  and trees into your systems as well.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:58):**  Why is that important to you and why is it important to your business?  
**[0:12:02-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:02):**  Much the same reason as George, that for me, everything that we can do to increase diversity  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:10):**  is a good thing.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:11):**  I don't like monocultures of Sitka spruce  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:15):**  any more than I like a 50 hectare field  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:20):**  with only one variety of wheat growing in it.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:23):**  We're trying across the farm  
**[0:12:26-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:26):**  to integrate all of our enterprises  
**[0:12:29-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:29):**  to a greater or lesser extent on all of our land.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:32):**  That may mean that there are bits of land  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:35):**  that we can't grow arable crops and that's fine,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:37):**  but being able to integrate the cattle and the forestry there  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:41):**  is going to work.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:42):**  There are other bits where we have a plan next year  
**[0:12:46-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:46):**  that we're going to follow George, basically.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:48):**  We're going to plant an agroforestry orchard  
**[0:12:51-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:51):**  with 36 metre rows.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:53):**  And this is going to bring us more diversity  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:58):**  to currently a 100 acre block  
**[0:13:01-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:01):**  that is grown with one crop in it.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:03):**  And I'm looking forward to being able to have  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:06):**  little strips of diversity and grow something  
**[0:13:10-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:10):**  in the 3D space above it,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:12):**  which is where we'll get the fruit from.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:13):**  We're planting the trees in strips.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:15):**  I think there are going to be about 15 strips  
**[0:13:18-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:18):**  and there are going to be, each of the strips will be,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:21):**  we haven't completely decided yet, a few metres wide  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:24):**  to allow us to have a pollinator strip, basically,  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:28):**  throughout this area.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:31):**  And between these pollinator strips  
**[0:13:33-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:33):**  with trees growing in them,  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:35):**  we're going to have 36 metres of space  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:39):**  that we can integrate both livestock and crops.  
**[0:13:44-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:44):**  And like George, that means that you're never  
**[0:13:47-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:47):**  more than 18 metres away from some proper diversity.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:52):**  And we should be able to harbour predators  
**[0:13:55-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:55):**  for the pests that we get in the crops  
**[0:13:59-0:14:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:59):**  and increase the amount of edge effect.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:02):**  So exchanging of nutrients between both our crops  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:07):**  and the diversity that we're using.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:11):**  So with the beneficial insects that you're likely  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:13):**  to be attracting within those strips,  
**[0:14:17-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:17):**  are you expecting that you'll see an increase  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:19):**  in the health outcomes for the livestock that are in there?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:22):**  Well, yes, as well as growing our cash crops  
**[0:14:27-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:27):**  in these 36 metre strips, we will be growing forage crops  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:30):**  and mob grazing our cattle and probably some sheep  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:34):**  and who knows what else through those areas.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:38):**  The more diversity that we can get into the animals diet,  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:43):**  the healthier they're going to be.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:45):**  The more diversity is in the environment,  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:48):**  the more they are going to be in balance  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:49):**  with what's working there.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:51):**  So yes, we do expect that any animals  
**[0:14:54-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:54):**  that are being grazed properly or used properly  
**[0:14:57-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:57):**  in the landscape will be healthier  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:59):**  and we'll see our vet bills go down.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:01):**  And those are fruit trees that you're talking about.  
**[0:15:03-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:03):**  Is there diversity in the type of fruits  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:05):**  and those fruits that you're going to be harvesting?  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:07):**  We have, I think it's about two dozen varieties  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:11):**  of pears, plums, apples, damsels, a bit of cherry  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:17):**  and I'm sure lots of others that I've forgotten about.  
**[0:15:20-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:20):**  We think it's important not just to have diversity  
**[0:15:24-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:24):**  of types of crops, so wheat and barley and oats  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:27):**  and apples and pears, but also to have variety within that.  
**[0:15:31-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:31):**  So different varieties of each of those crops.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:33):**  So we will have a variety of harvesting dates,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:36):**  varieties of heights of tree and a varieties of types  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:40):**  of fruit and what they're useful for.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:42):**  And like George, I'm not that bothered  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:44):**  if all of the fruit doesn't get harvested  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:47):**  because we'll find an animal to eat it off the floor instead.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:50):**  George, you've been taking an agroforestry approach as well.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:53):**  You've got fruit trees, you mentioned these already  
**[0:15:55-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:55):**  in your field borders.  
**[0:15:57-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:57):**  And one of the things that struck me  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:58):**  in what you said earlier is that you're really not expecting  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:00):**  to harvest that much of the fruit that's there  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:03):**  and you're going to let the trees grow higher  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:05):**  than you might see in a traditional orchard.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:08):**  What happens to the rest of it?  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:09):**  So in the margins where I've also got the fruits,  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:13):**  so there's fruit in the margins,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:14):**  there's also fruit in the belts that go across the field.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:17):**  But in the margins, those are very much designed  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:19):**  to be areas primarily for wildlife.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:22):**  So that's not to say they won't be grazed every so often.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:25):**  They might be grazed two or three times a year  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:27):**  just to open things up because the last thing you want  
**[0:16:29-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:29):**  is those areas to entirely scrub up  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:31):**  and then be actually reasonably ecologically undiverse.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:34):**  So occasionally opening those things up,  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:36):**  maybe popping some pigs in just to clear  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:38):**  a little bit of bramble or those sorts of things,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:40):**  but only in a very, very controlled setting  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:42):**  allowing that to happen.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:44):**  So the idea for the rest of that fruit and the nuts there  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:47):**  is to ensure that the wildlife that is on my farm  
**[0:16:50-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:50):**  has got a really fantastic source of food available.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:53):**  So it's making sure that we're not only feeding  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:55):**  humans off the farm,  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:56):**  we're making sure that the wildlife and the mammals  
**[0:16:59-0:17:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:59):**  and all the birds have a really fantastic habitat here.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:02):**  But then when it comes to the belts themselves,  
**[0:17:04-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:04):**  I want those trees to exhibit that more natural behavior  
**[0:17:06-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:06):**  and get that bit taller to ensure that there are  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:09):**  potentially nesting places for birds  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:11):**  and just a much more kind of natural ecosystem.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:14):**  It's still a very managed approach.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:16):**  I mean, I've got two rows of trees in every belt  
**[0:17:18-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:18):**  on these 42 meter centers.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:20):**  So it's not a completely natural thing.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:22):**  It's not a natural woodland.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:23):**  It's obviously a more managed approach,  
**[0:17:26-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:26):**  but that doesn't mean to say you can't kind of let things  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:29):**  be on the more natural spectrum of it.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:30):**  And that's kind of how I'm approaching it  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:32):**  and thinking, well, if there is some fallen fruit,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:34):**  I mean, as Johnny said,  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:35):**  you can soon get something in to pick that up and eat it  
**[0:17:37-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:37):**  and still utilize it as useful for your animals.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:39):**  So a phrase I've heard you use in the past  
**[0:17:41-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:41):**  is that there's a sort of secondary harvest,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:43):**  which is fantastic.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:44):**  Now, George, you've been experimenting, as you said,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:47):**  nearly eight years with different approaches on your farm.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:50):**  And whenever I've tried to draw you on this in the past  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:53):**  and sort of talk about your grand designs,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:55):**  you say, well, actually the grand design is,  
**[0:17:57-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:57):**  I just kind of, I fancy something and I feel interested  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:59):**  and I kind of give it a try.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:01):**  And you've been zero till at least since 2014,  
**[0:18:04-0:18:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:04):**  but that's about to change now.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:06):**  You're going to do something different again.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:08):**  So what's happening and why?  
**[0:18:09-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:09):**  I actually submised my watch  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:11):**  of organic conversion paperwork the other day.  
**[0:18:14-0:18:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:14):**  It is only on a small area for a start.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:16):**  So it's actually on the field  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:17):**  that's got the agroforestry in.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:18):**  It's the one that's first up for conversion,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:20):**  but the field next to that is going in  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:22):**  in this autumn as well.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:23):**  And essentially what I'm doing is  
**[0:18:25-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:25):**  every time I put a field into a herbal lay,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:28):**  it's going into that organic conversion.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:30):**  Unfortunately, I've got some land in herbal lays  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:32):**  under stewardship that was done before I wanted to convert.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:35):**  So I'm hoping I'll be able to just flip that into organic  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:37):**  at the end of that four-year period.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:39):**  But essentially this is taking a market-led approach.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:42):**  I know that my produce needs to be labeled as organic.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:45):**  I can't, with the way that I'm selling it  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:47):**  and the people I'm selling it to,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:48):**  I can't just say I haven't used any pesticides or fertilizer.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:51):**  They need that kind of label associated with it.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:54):**  So I kind of embraced that and thought,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:55):**  well, that's fair enough.  
**[0:18:57-0:18:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:57):**  But I mean, the problem is  
**[0:18:58-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:58):**  when as soon as you say you're going organic,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:00):**  I say, all right, well, I'm losing glyphosate then.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:02):**  And in that scenario, I can't be zero till  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:05):**  in the way that I have been zero till previously.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:07):**  And I do need to look at some level of cultivation.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:10):**  And it was sort of when you take that approach  
**[0:19:12-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:12):**  and having seen the amazing ecological  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:14):**  and habitat benefits of zero tillage,  
**[0:19:16-0:19:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:16):**  some really simple ones are kind of,  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:18):**  you go to the middle of an arable field  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:20):**  and you will find holes in the ground  
**[0:19:22-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:22):**  when your mice hold and things like that,  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:24):**  that habitat's been able to form  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:26):**  because we haven't been moving the soil at all.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:28):**  We've just been running through with no tillage whatsoever  
**[0:19:30-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:30):**  when we've been establishing those crops.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:32):**  So I want to take the best parts of that and say, right,  
**[0:19:35-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:35):**  well, we will have to plow every so often.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:37):**  So I'm looking at the fact, as I said earlier,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:38):**  sort of only 60% of my farm is going to be  
**[0:19:41-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:41):**  in conventional farming,  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:42):**  by which I mean kind of livestock fields or arable fields.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:47):**  And obviously they will rotate.  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:48):**  And so I'm looking at a system of saying, right,  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:50):**  well, if I were to have four years of herbal lace  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:52):**  or really diverse mix of grasses and herbs  
**[0:19:55-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:55):**  and legumes in there,  
**[0:19:56-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:56):**  that's an amazing way of revitalizing my soil,  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:58):**  really pounding a load of nutrition in there,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:00):**  fertility and having a fantastic place to graze livestock.  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:04):**  That can be my fertility build  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:06):**  and the livestock are a great way of me  
**[0:20:08-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:08):**  then making money on that.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:09):**  But then it also creates that habitat  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:11):**  that doesn't get disturbed.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:13):**  And then I'm looking at plowing my way out of that herbal lay  
**[0:20:16-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:16):**  and having a three year arable rotation.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:18):**  And the reason I don't want to go further than three years  
**[0:20:20-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:20):**  is because by using just three years of arable  
**[0:20:22-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:22):**  in that system, I shouldn't ever get too many weeds.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:25):**  And kind of the way I can kind of be comfortable  
**[0:20:28-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:28):**  with reverting to plowing is saying,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:29):**  well, it's okay if I plow one year in seven,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:32):**  but what I don't want to be doing  
**[0:20:33-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:33):**  is then doing any other level of cultivation  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:35):**  through that soil throughout that year.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:37):**  So I'm specifically designing a system  
**[0:20:39-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:39):**  that does not require an inter-row hoe.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:41):**  I want to cultivate the field, sow the field  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:43):**  and not come back until harvest.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:45):**  So that's it, that's in the first year anyway.  
**[0:20:47-0:20:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:47):**  What happens in the second year?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:48):**  The second and third year, in all likelihood,  
**[0:20:50-0:20:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:50):**  there will be spring pulses in this as well.  
**[0:20:53-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:53):**  And potentially then, you know,  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:54):**  I'm not quite sure which crops will fit where.  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:57):**  And one of the benefits of my agroforestry scheme  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:59):**  allows me to kind of have loads of different trials  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:01):**  going on here, which is always exciting.  
**[0:21:03-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:03):**  But yeah, so I'm only aiming to plow once  
**[0:21:06-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:06):**  and that will be shallowly,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:07):**  but I will be using other minimum tillage approaches  
**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:10):**  to both destroy the previous crop and establish a new one.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:14):**  But just making sure that I keep my cultivation window  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:17):**  really, really tight  
**[0:21:18-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:18):**  so that the time I am actually doing 100% disturbance  
**[0:21:21-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:21):**  on those fields is as minimal as possible.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:23):**  So give me an example of that.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:24):**  What, you know, you talked about min tillage techniques.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:28):**  What sort of thing are you thinking?  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:29):**  So the one that has excited me most,  
**[0:21:31-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:31):**  which I'm really keen to try is,  
**[0:21:33-0:21:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:33):**  it's essentially a type of rotavator.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:35):**  An Italian company called Celli make the one that I've seen  
**[0:21:37-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:37):**  that I'm interested in trying.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:39):**  And essentially the idea is that it simply goes through  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:41):**  and slices the roots at a specified depth under the soil.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:44):**  You can set your depth, slices the roots there  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:46):**  and then tosses the top part of the plant  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:49):**  over behind the machine.  
**[0:21:50-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:50):**  And then means all the roots dry out.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:52):**  And so that's a way of killing the plant  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:53):**  without inverting your soil.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:55):**  It is obviously causing soil disturbance,  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:57):**  but my counter to that is saying,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:59):**  I'm building so much amazing biodiversity in other areas.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:03):**  And I've got my biodiversity strips within 18 metres maximum  
**[0:22:08-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:08):**  of any location that has been disturbed,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:10):**  that is quite likely to recolonise very quickly.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:12):**  So there is a level of disturbance.  
**[0:22:14-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:14):**  There is a level of destruction,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:15):**  but I think I can be happy with that.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:17):**  And are you planning to use ruminants  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:19):**  to sort of manage the land in the winter time as well?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:22):**  Ruminants will be absolutely critical  
**[0:22:24-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:24):**  in terms of the fertility building period.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:27):**  So those four year herbal lay periods  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:29):**  are going to be really, really important  
**[0:22:30-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:30):**  to have ruminants on.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:31):**  I know there are, I think Johnny's been trying,  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:34):**  doing winter grazing on cereals.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:37):**  And certainly when we've got a cover crop  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:39):**  in before a spring crop,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:40):**  definitely I'll be aiming to utilise ruminants on that.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:43):**  And potentially monogastrics as well.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:45):**  There's nothing maybe wrong with chucking some pigs  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:47):**  across the cover crop as well.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:48):**  So I'm definitely looking at utilising animals  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:50):**  to manage within that arable system as well.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:53):**  So that's to hold down some of the weeds  
**[0:22:57-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:57):**  that might otherwise grow up.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:58):**  So that when you plant the next year's worth  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:00):**  of cereal crop, it's given a fighting chance.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:03):**  Exactly, yes.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:04):**  You've got to make sure that your cash crop  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:06):**  can get up and away.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:07):**  But once it gets up and away,  
**[0:23:08-0:23:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:08):**  provided it's ahead of whatever weeds you've got  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:12):**  and it's vigorous,  
**[0:23:13-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:13):**  I'm hoping that the number of,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:14):**  the level of weeds we burn within that crop  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:17):**  shouldn't be too large.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:18):**  Johnny, George mentioned there  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:20):**  that you've already got some experience of that.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:23):**  I wonder if you could share that with us.  
**[0:23:24-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:24):**  We have for a number of years now,  
**[0:23:27-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:27):**  it might even be 60,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:29):**  we've been bringing sheep down from the hills  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:32):**  over the winter and we've been looking after them.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:36):**  I call it B&B.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:37):**  We've been looking after them over the winter.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:40):**  We have a very good relationship  
**[0:23:41-0:23:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:41):**  with a sheep farmer from 50 miles away.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:44):**  In the past couple of years,  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:46):**  we've been putting those sheep onto our wheat and oats  
**[0:23:52-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:52):**  that we sow in the winter.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:54):**  And we've been trying to sow those crops quite early  
**[0:23:57-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:57):**  so that there is a lot of growth,  
**[0:24:00-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:00):**  which we can then eat with the sheep over the winter,  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:02):**  sometimes more than once.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:04):**  And that cuts down on the need for,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:07):**  in particular, fungicides,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:09):**  because it keeps the crops clean,  
**[0:24:11-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:11):**  as well as giving us an income from grazing the sheep  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:14):**  and allowing those cereals to tiller out really nicely  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:19):**  and get closer to their full yield potential.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:23):**  So you're planting and then as the shoots come up,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:26):**  they're being nibbled down by the sheep.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:28):**  What does that do?  
**[0:24:29-0:24:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:29):**  Does that make the roots stronger?  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:31):**  Well, it tillers out, having been eaten.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:35):**  And because we're putting the fertility back in  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:39):**  that comes out the back of the sheep,  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:41):**  the nutrient cycles get to work properly.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:44):**  Fascinating.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:45):**  Thank you very much.  
**[0:24:46-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:46):**  And both of you, you're very passionate about what you do  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:49):**  and very passionate about moving away  
**[0:24:51-0:24:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:51):**  from the conventional systems that you inherited  
**[0:24:54-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:54):**  and moving to a different system through agroecology  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:58):**  to regenerative in one way or another.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:01):**  Now, Johnny, you've already talked about  
**[0:25:03-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:03):**  some of your regenerative inspiration,  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:05):**  George Monbiot and Alan Savory specifically,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:08):**  but this goes back a bit further  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:11):**  than those two characters, doesn't it?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:13):**  So where does your inspiration come from originally?  
**[0:25:15-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:15):**  My inspiration comes from a variety of different places.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:19):**  I started by reading those books,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:22):**  but I also did some postgraduate study  
**[0:25:26-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:26):**  in sustainable agriculture  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:28):**  and read quite a lot about no till agriculture.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:32):**  So the builders of the cross lot drill, Baker,  
**[0:25:36-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:36):**  he wrote a very good book on no till agriculture.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:39):**  And I'm now drawing quite a lot of inspiration  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:43):**  from my great, great aunt who founded the Soil Association  
**[0:25:48-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:48):**  and I'm finding her old papers  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:53):**  and really drawing quite a lot of inspiration  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:56):**  from the way that in the forties,  
**[0:25:59-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:59):**  they thought of what they were doing with agriculture  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:02):**  and seeing a lot of similarities  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:05):**  in what we're trying to do now.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:06):**  What you're doing is it's on a large chunk of land  
**[0:26:09-0:26:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:09):**  and you're trying to do something quite exciting.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:13):**  Are you unusual in that area  
**[0:26:15-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:15):**  or are there lots of other farmers across Fife  
**[0:26:18-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:18):**  and you're sort of part of Scotland doing the same thing?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:21):**  I would say I'm not unusual at all.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:23):**  I'd say there's a big network of farmers  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:27):**  who are looking to improve their land.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:31):**  In particular in Fife, we have a lot of mob grazers  
**[0:26:35-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:35):**  and dealing with the cattle,  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:37):**  but we also have lots of people  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:39):**  who are looking to push the boundaries  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:41):**  on arable farming as well,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:44):**  particularly through the organisation base,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:47):**  which has been really useful  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:50):**  from a knowledge sharing perspective for all of us.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:54):**  So when you hear in the news or just sort of on social media  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:57):**  that farming is just a mining activity,  
**[0:27:00-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:00):**  that's not something that you recognise  
**[0:27:02-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:02):**  in the landscape around you?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:04):**  Oh no, I absolutely recognise that  
**[0:27:06-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:06):**  in the landscape around us,  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:09):**  but that doesn't mean that wanting to change that is unique.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:13):**  There are plenty of farmers up and down the country  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:16):**  and around the world who may not be doing everything  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:20):**  that they can to improve their soil,  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:22):**  but there are still plenty who are.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:24):**  So for you, you took over,  
**[0:27:27-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:27):**  I think from your father three years ago,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:29):**  and you've taken the business in a different direction,  
**[0:27:32-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:32):**  which means that your family  
**[0:27:33-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:33):**  that are working on the farm, staff that are coming in,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:35):**  they've had to move with you.  
**[0:27:38-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:38):**  And I wonder if there are any particular,  
**[0:27:40-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:40):**  what you found the most difficult thing in the transition,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:43):**  whether it was persuading people to come with you,  
**[0:27:45-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:45):**  or if there was a particular type of crop  
**[0:27:48-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:48):**  that you found more difficult than others.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:49):**  And I guess the converse is, what was the easiest?  
**[0:27:52-0:27:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:52):**  I was very fortunate that we had quite a long lead time  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:58):**  to me taking over from my father.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:00):**  And throughout that process,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:03):**  we've had a farm manager who understands  
**[0:28:08-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:08):**  regenerative agriculture  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:09):**  and is looking to further what we're doing  
**[0:28:13-0:28:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:13):**  along with what I'm thinking.  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:15):**  So that has been a huge relief, I suppose.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:20):**  And the changes that we've been trying to make  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:24):**  were all started before I was trying to make them,  
**[0:28:28-0:28:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:28):**  as it were.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:29):**  And I suppose the most difficult thing  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:32):**  is changing people's mindset.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:34):**  And that is a whole bunch of people  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:38):**  that we are involved with,  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:40):**  that I see agriculture as a bunch of interlocking  
**[0:28:44-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:44):**  circular systems from which we get produce.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:48):**  But agriculture, certainly since the Second World War,  
**[0:28:52-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:52):**  has been thought of as a very linear process  
**[0:28:56-0:28:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:56):**  with inputs, throughputs, and outputs.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:59):**  And changing that mindset from linear to circular  
**[0:29:03-0:29:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:03):**  is very, very tricky  
**[0:29:05-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:05):**  and is still taking time.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:09):**  George, have there been moments for you  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:11):**  when you thought to yourself,  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:12):**  yeah, this is it, this is working for me now?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:14):**  I mean, I think there are always times  
**[0:29:16-0:29:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:16):**  you've got to really do yourself up  
**[0:29:19-0:29:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:19):**  and have confidence that you're doing the right thing.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:21):**  Because I'll be honest,  
**[0:29:22-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:22):**  when you make the changes that I've been making,  
**[0:29:24-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:24):**  there are plenty of kicks in the goolies  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:27):**  that you get along the way.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:28):**  So a few case in points would be kind of issues I've had  
**[0:29:33-0:29:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:33):**  with heritage wheat establishment,  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:34):**  just because I didn't manage to get on in time this year,  
**[0:29:37-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:37):**  and I've got a very patchy establishment of that,  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:39):**  and it wasn't great last year either,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:41):**  just due to the fact that timeliness,  
**[0:29:43-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:43):**  and to be honest, the state that our soils are in,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:46):**  which is why I'm implementing so many changes.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:48):**  So I would say that on the whole,  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:50):**  that mostly I've had to have a little bit of faith  
**[0:29:53-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:53):**  in what I'm doing,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:54):**  but there are a few little glimmers  
**[0:29:56-0:29:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:56):**  that you really know are good.  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:58):**  And I think for me, kind of,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:59):**  you go and stick a herbal layer in the ground  
**[0:30:01-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:01):**  and get it established,  
**[0:30:03-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:03):**  and you go and have a look at that a year later.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:04):**  And I don't tend to go around with a spade  
**[0:30:07-0:30:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:07):**  like some farmers,  
**[0:30:08-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:08):**  but I have a very useful knife that works like a trowel.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:10):**  So I tend to go out and stick my knife in the ground  
**[0:30:13-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:13):**  and have a look in there.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:14):**  And quite simply, the change associated with the soil  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:18):**  from a year of having a genuinely diverse herbal layer,  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:22):**  to an unctuously brown, deliciously,  
**[0:30:25-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:25):**  like the smell of the soil,  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:26):**  like you genuinely want to eat it.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:28):**  Pretty sure it's gritty, I don't recommend it.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:30):**  And then as well as that,  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:31):**  like the look of these herbal layers as well,  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:33):**  when you go in them, I mean, for a start,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:35):**  I have actually had people noticing herbal layers saying,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:37):**  oh, wow, these look, there's lots going on here.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:40):**  And as well as that, they got tons of flowers.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:42):**  And I'm someone who likes things to be pretty  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:44):**  and to be beautiful.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:45):**  And the flowers that you get within a herbal layer  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:47):**  are pretty superb.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:48):**  And I have this thing where I like to kind of stop  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:51):**  on the farm and have a little sit easier  
**[0:30:53-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:53):**  when it's not been raining,  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:54):**  so you don't get a wet bottom.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:55):**  But it's nice to have a little bit of a sit on the ground  
**[0:30:57-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:57):**  in somewhere interesting and focus on the nature  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:59):**  and what's going on around you.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:01):**  And I think that's when you can then see  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:03):**  the amount of insect life,  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:04):**  the amount of tiny flies and beetles  
**[0:31:06-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:06):**  and all kind of weird stuff going on.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:08):**  And so I suppose that for me is the stuff  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:10):**  that I'm really showing me I'm winning,  
**[0:31:12-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:12):**  is the introduction of genuine levels of diversity  
**[0:31:15-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:15):**  in the cropping that I've got  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:17):**  or the plants that I'm sowing,  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:18):**  and seeing that uptick in diversity  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:20):**  when I do stop and take a chance  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:23):**  to actually look at what's going on around me.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:24):**  One of the things that seems to help you  
**[0:31:26-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:26):**  is that you seem to be able to think in the longer term.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:29):**  You've mentioned to me before about disease.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:32):**  If there's a disease in part of a crop in one year,  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:34):**  then rather than writing it off just in terms of that year  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:38):**  and thinking that's been a bad year,  
**[0:31:39-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:39):**  in your mind you seem to write it off over several years.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:42):**  And I wonder if your past life as a banker helps with that.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:46):**  Well, I suppose that the banking part means  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:49):**  that I've sat down and written myself a costing spreadsheet  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:52):**  and really kind of have a pretty tight grip  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:55):**  on actually what things cost.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:57):**  And I coupled that with the fact  
**[0:31:59-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:59):**  that traditionally farming has always been  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:00):**  a generational opportunity.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:02):**  It's not been an annual cost exercise.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:05):**  And the issue is that since we've been  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:08):**  spooning everything on, everything's come out of the bag,  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:10):**  it's enabled us over the last 50 years  
**[0:32:13-0:32:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:13):**  to go very much to an annual form of looking at the farm.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:16):**  But we know that farming is breaking.  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:19):**  Though I'm sure there are farmers out there  
**[0:32:20-0:32:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:20):**  with their heads in the sand about this,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:21):**  but most people, if they're honest with themselves,  
**[0:32:23-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:23):**  know that the current way of farming doesn't work.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:26):**  And so consequently, I think it's when you,  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:28):**  when you look at it and you say,  
**[0:32:29-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:29):**  all right, well, I have got a little issue here.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:32):**  And again, my costing spreadsheet  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:33):**  will tell me how much that is.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:34):**  But if you couple that kind of analytical financial data  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:38):**  with actually going out and really looking  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:41):**  at what's going on with your crop.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:42):**  And so, you know, the instance you're talking about  
**[0:32:44-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:44):**  was an instance I've had with not using insecticides.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:47):**  And this was the fact that in a single year,  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:49):**  I think probably across the entire farm,  
**[0:32:52-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:52):**  my BYDV, this is a virus you get in wheat  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:55):**  called Bala Yellow Dwarf Virus,  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:57):**  that comes about and you'll get patches in your wheat  
**[0:33:01-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:01):**  with severely impacted yield.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:03):**  In one field, it was down sort of maybe a ton and a half,  
**[0:33:06-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:06):**  two tonne a hectare, but overall the entire farm,  
**[0:33:08-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:08):**  I think I was down around about half a tonne a hectare  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:11):**  and where I should have been.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:12):**  But I haven't had issues  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:13):**  for the four or five years before that.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:15):**  So rather than saying you've had  
**[0:33:17-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:17):**  a half a tonne a hectare yield deficit,  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:19):**  actually you've had maybe 0.1 of a tonne a hectare,  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:21):**  which in today's prices is 20 pounds a hectare  
**[0:33:24-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:24):**  that you've cost yourself.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:26):**  All right, now in theory, probably  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:27):**  insecticides are a little bit cheaper than that, maybe,  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:30):**  but look at all the amazing benefits  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:32):**  that you're able to have by saying,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:34):**  you know what, I'm not going to use insecticides.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:36):**  And this is across the board with fungicides as well,  
**[0:33:39-0:33:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:39):**  with nitrogen usage.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:41):**  And it's sunny that looking a little bit more long term  
**[0:33:44-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:44):**  on how you're structuring a farm system  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:46):**  can really change your kind of how you see  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:49):**  the issues you've got on your farm.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:50):**  And in terms of that cost differential,  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:53):**  by the time there's an organic label on there,  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:55):**  which adds value from a customer perspective,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:58):**  then potentially you're out ahead in the end anyway.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:01):**  Jonny, you've talked to me before about the fact  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:04):**  that this is the first year for you  
**[0:34:06-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:06):**  that you're going completely no nitrogen  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:09):**  on all of your pastures.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:10):**  What led you to taking that decision?  
**[0:34:12-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:12):**  Simply that we don't need them anymore  
**[0:34:15-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:15):**  because we're managing our grazing differently  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:19):**  in order to get more life in the soil  
**[0:34:21-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:21):**  and therefore not be mining the roots of our pastures.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:27):**  And therefore the grass grows better.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:30):**  It's for the same reason that if we manage cover crops  
**[0:34:36-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:36):**  in our arable land in this way,  
**[0:34:39-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:39):**  we can put energy back into the soil  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:42):**  and reduce our nitrogen requirements  
**[0:34:45-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:45):**  in arable crops afterwards as well.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:47):**  So this is the first step for us in reducing nitrogen  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:54):**  on a whole variety of crops.  
**[0:34:56-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:56):**  The first one that we're doing is pasture.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:59):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:00):**  And George, it would be fair to say  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:00):**  that you're not the world's greatest fan of nitrogen.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:03):**  No, exactly.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:05):**  And so, I mean, to be clear, I am still using nitrogen now,  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:08):**  but it's obviously coming out of my system  
**[0:35:09-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:09):**  in a big, big way.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:10):**  And besides reducing it in crops,  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:13):**  I'm obviously eliminating it from a lot of others.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:14):**  So my heritage-  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:15):**  Sorry, while we're talking about this,  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:17):**  I really should make it clear.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:18):**  We're talking about synthetic nitrogen  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:19):**  rather than the natural nitrogen that's in the system.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:22):**  Yes, exactly.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:23):**  And certainly, you know,  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:24):**  I haven't been using nitrogen on my heritage wheats  
**[0:35:27-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:27):**  and I think it's a beneficial thing.  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:29):**  But I mean, if we look back at the earlier thing  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:31):**  I said about BYDV.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:33):**  So BYDV is a virus which is spread by aphids.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:36):**  It's carried on aphids.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:37):**  And so people seem to think that they need to target  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:39):**  the aphid as the problem.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:41):**  That's the problem.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:42):**  And in fact, actually the aphid is much closer  
**[0:35:44-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:44):**  to being a symptom of an underlying issue with your crop.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:47):**  And essentially over use of nitrogen in the past,  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:50):**  we've got these really kind of soils  
**[0:35:51-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:51):**  full of synthetic nitrogen,  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:53):**  which cause all these kind of imbalances in crop nutrition.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:56):**  And that's the reason which opens up our crops  
**[0:35:59-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:59):**  to attacks from things like aphids,  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:01):**  but also attacks from diseases as well.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:04):**  And we really need to get a grasp  
**[0:36:05-0:36:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:05):**  on how nitrogen works on our farms  
**[0:36:08-0:36:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:08):**  because that's how we get away from these pest issues.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:10):**  We can't, you know,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:11):**  there are lots of people who want to use technology  
**[0:36:13-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:13):**  to get away from this technology and plant breeding  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:15):**  and gene editing and potentially GMOs,  
**[0:36:17-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:17):**  which is probably a rabbit hole.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:19):**  We don't want to go down now,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:20):**  other than the fact, I think everyone knows  
**[0:36:21-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:21):**  that I'm not pro any of those things.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:23):**  And in fact, actually we just need to sort out  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:25):**  our farming system.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:26):**  And a lot of those things are benchmarked on nitrogen use.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:29):**  We're coming to the end of the programme now.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:31):**  And I just wonder whether there are things  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:33):**  that you would do differently if you had your time again.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:35):**  You know, things that you perhaps do faster  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:38):**  or things that you just rather forget about altogether.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:41):**  Jonny, what about you?  
**[0:36:42-0:36:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:42):**  I'm so near the beginning of this process.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:45):**  I'm not sure that in an agricultural cycle,  
**[0:36:48-0:36:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:48):**  I could go much quicker.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:50):**  I would have loved to have got more fences  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:53):**  and more fields more quickly.  
**[0:36:55-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:55):**  We could get more animals into more fields more often,  
**[0:36:58-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:58):**  but that's very simple.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:00):**  And I just want to continue on this journey  
**[0:37:04-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:04):**  for as long as possible.  
**[0:37:05-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:05):**  And George, what about you?  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:06):**  Are there things that you'd do differently?  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:08):**  The biggest thing would be actually,  
**[0:37:10-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:10):**  and I think I knew it really early on that we needed  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:12):**  to stick herbal lays in and do a lot of them.  
**[0:37:15-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:15):**  And I've heard loads of people say, you know,  
**[0:37:17-0:37:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:17):**  they did a herbal lay once and they kind of played it through.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:20):**  And then by the time they established their next one,  
**[0:37:22-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:22):**  they wished they'd put the whole of the farm in previously.  
**[0:37:24-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:24):**  So I think kind of, I've seen herbal lays as being  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:27):**  such an amazing benefit to really fixing problems  
**[0:37:30-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:30):**  that I've had in the farm.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:31):**  You know, I've tried farming my way out of issues  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:33):**  in a conventional way in an annual system and you can't.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:38):**  You just make more problems.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:39):**  And those fields that I've got those issues  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:42):**  are now going into herbal lays.  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:43):**  They should have been in much, much sooner.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:45):**  Also, I mean, my agroforestry,  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:47):**  that's literally been in the works for five years.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:49):**  And I would, you know,  
**[0:37:50-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:50):**  if I could have done that five years ago,  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:51):**  to be five years more advanced,  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:53):**  trees that are five years old versus just gone in the ground,  
**[0:37:56-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:56):**  that would have been absolutely huge  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:58):**  if I could have done that.  
**[0:37:59-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:59):**  But then again, had I established that five years ago,  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:02):**  the scheme would have been so simplistic  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:03):**  that it wouldn't have anywhere near the benefits  
**[0:38:05-0:38:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:05):**  it's got now.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:06):**  So I think, I mean, I'm pushing incredibly hard  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:08):**  with a lot of projects on the farm.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:10):**  And to be honest, I wish they were all done yesterday,  
**[0:38:12-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:12):**  two years ago, five years ago.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:16):**  But yeah, we're getting there.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:18):**  We're getting there.  
**[0:38:19-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:19):**  Fantastic.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:20):**  You've both been absolutely fascinating to talk to,  
**[0:38:23-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:23):**  but that's all we've got time for.  
**[0:38:24-0:38:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:24):**  So I'd like to thank my guests,

**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. This is the third programme in a series in  which I talk to farmers delivering agro-ecological agriculture on their farms. Today we're talking  all things arable and I'm joined by two inspirational farmers putting agroecology into practice.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:22):**  George Young farms at Fobbing Farm in Essex and Johnny Balfour is from Balburnie Farm  in Fife. The farmers in this series are working with the Soil Association as Agroecology Ambassadors  and as part of the Soil Association's 10 Years for Agroecology project. The series has also  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:37):**  been inspired by the Food Farming and Countryside Commission's work on farming for change. Welcome  both.  Hello Luke.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:44):**  Hi there, nice to be here.  George, can I start with you? You came back to the family farm seven years ago and not  overly excited at the prospect. Now it's your passion, your heart and soul is in the very  
**[0:00:55-0:00:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:00:55):**  soil. What changed?  Well frightening enough it's actually approaching eight years now and I really don't know where  the time has gone. I mean essentially my previous life was working in banking in London and  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:05):**  essentially that job just wasn't doing it for me anymore. I was working really long  hours and I just assumed that the farming life would be better but I never assumed it  would really kind of get into my bones quite the way that it has. And essentially when  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:17):**  I came home we were a very conventional farm, growing three crops, mint hill but with sun  ploughing. And I went and visited a farmer quite early on with my agronomist, a guy called  Simon Cowell who I'm sure a lot of people have heard of, an exceptional farmer who's  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:29):**  only about 40 minutes away from me. And he was doing zero till farming so he'd stopped  his cultivating. And it was just the beginning of me thinking about farming in a more ecological  sort of way. And I started seeing, I saw the changes that he'd managed to get on his farm.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:44):**  We made those same changes here on the farm and dropped insecticides and at that point  seeing the amazing uptick in biodiversity just beginning to happen. And all of a sudden  it really flipped my mindset on what farming could be. It wasn't just kind of farming in  
**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:01:59):**  a broad scale across every acre and you could really start looking at it in a different  light. Yeah, that little kind of tiny bit of an idea right from that start has then  exploded into the nature-based approach that I'm taking now.  
**[0:02:10-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:10):**  Jonny, you're on a similar journey. You took on the family farm three years ago I think.  I suppose I was fascinated by regenerative agriculture having read George Monbiot's book  Feral along with Alan Savory's book Foundations in Holistic Management. They are a very unusual  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:36):**  pairing and I saw the similarities in what they were proposing in terms of managed and  unmanaged environments. But that both of those people are proposing a difference in land  management that I wanted to try and replicate on our farm.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:02:56):**  Just thinking about those two people that you've talked about as your inspiration. George  Monbiot has been roundly anti-ruminant and Alan Savory, you know, ruminants are absolutely  at the centre of what he talks about. So I wonder what it is, what it was about what  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:11):**  George Monbiot was saying that somehow connected for you the dots across to Alan Savory's work.  It was reading about the Yellowstone National Park and the way that they used the impact  of wolves to move the ruminants in the park around. I took that as what about in our managed  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:33):**  landscape we don't want wolves in Glenrothas and Fife. That would be ridiculous. But what  we do have are fences. So managing our animals in a way that brings life back to the soil  is something that is I think both Alan Savory and George Monbiot are basically the same.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:03:54):**  My memory of that Yellowstone story is that the wolves in the way that they herded and  managed the deer, I think in particular in that situation, it completely changed the  landscape. It changed the way that the land was producing, the way the land was growing,  
**[0:04:11-0:04:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:11):**  but it also changed the shape of rivers. It sort of reordered to natural chaos and reordered  it. And you're talking about fencing and that sort of thing there. Do you think it's possible  to kind of not only recreate some of those systems, but allow that natural chaos to shape  
**[0:04:25-0:04:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:25):**  itself in some way?  On a very small scale, I feel that rewilding is a spectrum and that we can wild little  bits of hedgerows or beetle banks in the middle of fields, little pockets of woodland. I feel  
**[0:04:44-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:04:44):**  that the large scale landscape regeneration that happened in Yellowstone isn't going to  happen in the middle of Fife. It's not going to happen in the middle of Essex either. And  that's fine because we live in a different part of the world, but still in anything we  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:01):**  can do that increases diversity is a good thing and I want to do more of it.  Fantastic. George, for you particularly, I think the wildlife seems to be absolutely  at the centre of everything that you're doing with substantial portions of your farm managed  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:15):**  with wildlife in mind. How much of your farm would you say is actively designed for wildlife?  Well, I mean, this is very much the design that I'm beginning to put across the farm  now. So kind of the project that happened this winter just gone is my agroforestry trial  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:28):**  within one field. So that's within a 50 acre field. And I'm really kind of concentrating  on the farm where I live at the moment to kind of design what I'm hoping is a kind of  model of how farming can really interact with nature. So the overall aim is to have a system  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:43):**  where you've got sort of about 40% of the farm somewhere between 35 and 40% in permanent  organic cover. Now that doesn't mean that that's just left to do its own thing. Some  of that is harvestable, some of it is more harvestable than others. But critically, it's  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:05:57):**  in perennial cropping, potentially some trees and shrubs, but new real kind of places that  wildlife can navigate the farm safely without risk of predation. The simple thing to break  it down as is around about 10% of my farm will be in something that I'm calling a wild  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:12):**  scene. And we've actually got the start of this in quite advanced form in between kind  of a couple of seawalls on our farm. And that was kind of the inspiration of what I want  this wild scene to look like through the middle of my farm. And at the moment, I'm just kind  
**[0:06:25-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:25):**  of bodily using one of the stewardship schemes to kind of map that seam out that runs through  the middle of the farm. So that's sort of 10%. But then the next sort of 25 to 30% is  utilizing field margins. So the field margins are kind of like a semi wild field margin.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:41):**  So they will be somewhat harvested, but not wholly harvested. So maybe we're going to  end up harvesting at the beginning, we might be harvesting 70 or 80% of the stuff that  I'm planting in there. So these are things like fruit bushes, and there are some fruit  
**[0:06:53-0:06:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:06:53):**  trees and nut trees in those areas. But as those areas kind of wild up and scrub out,  I'm going to harvest less and less. So it might be only harvested at 20 or 30% from  that area. And they are mainly that kind of wildlife corridor and transportation route.  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:07):**  But then kind of we've got 20 to 25% is sitting in these agroforestry belts running across  the fields. So these are the really key thing to ensure that you end up having much smaller  manageable chunks of land which are not particularly wide. So I've gone for a maximum width of  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:21):**  36 meters so that insects can get out into the middle of every single bit of potentially  monoculture land. And those those bits of agroforestry are going to have a much higher  rate of harvest. They're going to be much closer to being farmed, but I'm not going  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:35):**  to be too bothered if I don't harvest anything. I'd much rather my trees exhibit more natural  behavior, potentially be taller than they'd otherwise be. I don't want to prune them really  heavily. I want that to be much more naturally focused. And if we lose some of the fruit  
**[0:07:48-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:07:48):**  and it drops on the floor, then so be it.  Jason Vale, Director of Agroforestry,  And the structures and why regenerative and why agroecology. So could I just ask you both  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:02):**  to describe a little bit about what you farm, how much land you have available so that people  listening can get a sense of who you are as farmers and then it's easier to kind of layer  on top what it is you're actually doing with that land. So Johnny, can you go first?  
**[0:08:16-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:16):**  Johnny  We're based in Fife in Scotland. We manage about 1300 hectares of arable land, pasture,  little bit of hill and forestry.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:29):**  Jason Vale, Director of Agroforestry,  And we're particularly thinking about cereals today, the arable sort of aspect. Where do  your products, what are you producing? What specifically are you producing and where do  
**[0:08:36-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:36):**  they go? Who are your customers?  Johnny  So we're very lucky having very local customers for our arable produce. We have wheat, barley,  
**[0:08:46-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:08:46):**  and oats, beans and carrots are our main crops and we let land out for potatoes, cabbages,  cauliflowers. The barley all goes for malting. This year mostly went to Alawa, which is 25  miles away. The oats, we're very lucky, five miles down the road, we have Quaker oats.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:08):**  So that's where they all go. The wheat, lots of it goes to Diageo, which is five miles  down the road the other way.  Jason Vale  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:15):**  So you were growing for Quaker oats and the barley and the wheat, they were different  companies, but they're essentially distilling companies of one kind or another. So George,  just coming to you, what are you, what do you farm?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:24):**  George  Yeah, so I'm in South Essex. We're on about 1200 acres overall. The farm I'm really concentrating  on doing a lot of my trial work and trial kind of formation of how I want to farm is  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:35):**  on the 650 acres at home. And we're growing, we're still growing commodity crops. So we're  still growing reasonably standard wheat, beans and peas. But on top of that, we're also,  we're growing heritage wheat. So I've got a big old diverse range of heritage wheats  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:09:51):**  and then buckwheat, which I grow for Hodmedod, lentils, which also goes to that home, hemp,  I've been playing around with a little bit, linseed, and we're doing a little trial of  flax for some linen this year as well. We also have some cows on herbal leaves.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:07):**  Jason Vale  And you're also thinking of going a step further, aren't you, with your milling wheat in particular  where you're going to be producing your own flour, even your own bread?  
**[0:10:14-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:14):**  George  My whole goal is to get to a place where I don't have any commodity crops anymore. I  am growing specifically for a localistic market and where I absolutely know for sure that  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:26):**  my crops are destined for food, you know, food with a capital F essentially. The heritage  wheats I've got, they will all be going through my flour mill, which I'm just in the final  stages of setting up at the moment. And this partly came about because when you grow small  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:38):**  quantities of anything, if it can't go out in a 29 ton bulkier, like most of our crops  do at the moment, if it can't go out in that sort of quantity, if you've only grown say  four or five ton of it, and where I am in the southeast, there aren't many small mills  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:10:52):**  that can manage that small quantity, you know, without you'd get it all milled at once and  then you've got a load of product with a shelf shelf life to get rid of. So it made much  more sense to take control of that processing element of my supply chain so that I can kind  
**[0:11:04-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:04):**  of process and sell directly into bakeries. And then potentially, and this is the project  I'm working on at the moment, is to then actually even have a bakery on the farm to really kind  of control the fact that I'm not only growing a fantastic product without any pesticides  
**[0:11:17-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:17):**  or fertilisers, I'm then milling it, not putting any additives into that what's being milled,  and then getting the opportunity to bake with it and produce hugely nutritious food out  at the other end.  
**[0:11:27-0:11:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:27):**  One of the challenges with this series is that we've kind of divided the programmes  to move away from monocultures and embrace diversity and you both integrate livestock  and trees into your systems as well.  
**[0:11:58-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:11:58):**  Why is that important to you and why is it important to your business?  Much the same reason as George, that for me, everything that we can do to increase diversity  is a good thing.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:11):**  I don't like monocultures of Sitka spruce  any more than I like a 50 hectare field  with only one variety of wheat growing in it.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:23):**  We're trying across the farm  to integrate all of our enterprises  to a greater or lesser extent on all of our land.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:32):**  That may mean that there are bits of land  that we can't grow arable crops and that's fine,  but being able to integrate the cattle and the forestry there  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:41):**  is going to work.  There are other bits where we have a plan next year  that we're going to follow George, basically.  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:48):**  We're going to plant an agroforestry orchard  with 36 metre rows.  And this is going to bring us more diversity  
**[0:12:58-0:13:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:12:58):**  to currently a 100 acre block  that is grown with one crop in it.  And I'm looking forward to being able to have  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:06):**  little strips of diversity and grow something  in the 3D space above it,  which is where we'll get the fruit from.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:13):**  We're planting the trees in strips.  I think there are going to be about 15 strips  and there are going to be, each of the strips will be,  
**[0:13:21-0:13:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:21):**  we haven't completely decided yet, a few metres wide  to allow us to have a pollinator strip, basically,  throughout this area.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:31):**  And between these pollinator strips  with trees growing in them,  we're going to have 36 metres of space  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:39):**  that we can integrate both livestock and crops.  And like George, that means that you're never  more than 18 metres away from some proper diversity.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:13:52):**  And we should be able to harbour predators  for the pests that we get in the crops  and increase the amount of edge effect.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:02):**  So exchanging of nutrients between both our crops  and the diversity that we're using.  So with the beneficial insects that you're likely  
**[0:14:13-0:14:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:13):**  to be attracting within those strips,  are you expecting that you'll see an increase  in the health outcomes for the livestock that are in there?  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:22):**  Well, yes, as well as growing our cash crops  in these 36 metre strips, we will be growing forage crops  and mob grazing our cattle and probably some sheep  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:34):**  and who knows what else through those areas.  The more diversity that we can get into the animals diet,  the healthier they're going to be.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:45):**  The more diversity is in the environment,  the more they are going to be in balance  with what's working there.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:51):**  So yes, we do expect that any animals  that are being grazed properly or used properly  in the landscape will be healthier  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:14:59):**  and we'll see our vet bills go down.  And those are fruit trees that you're talking about.  Is there diversity in the type of fruits  
**[0:15:05-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:05):**  and those fruits that you're going to be harvesting?  We have, I think it's about two dozen varieties  of pears, plums, apples, damsels, a bit of cherry  
**[0:15:17-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:17):**  and I'm sure lots of others that I've forgotten about.  We think it's important not just to have diversity  of types of crops, so wheat and barley and oats  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:27):**  and apples and pears, but also to have variety within that.  So different varieties of each of those crops.  So we will have a variety of harvesting dates,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:36):**  varieties of heights of tree and a varieties of types  of fruit and what they're useful for.  And like George, I'm not that bothered  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:44):**  if all of the fruit doesn't get harvested  because we'll find an animal to eat it off the floor instead.  George, you've been taking an agroforestry approach as well.  
**[0:15:53-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:53):**  You've got fruit trees, you mentioned these already  in your field borders.  And one of the things that struck me  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:15:58):**  in what you said earlier is that you're really not expecting  to harvest that much of the fruit that's there  and you're going to let the trees grow higher  
**[0:16:05-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:05):**  than you might see in a traditional orchard.  What happens to the rest of it?  So in the margins where I've also got the fruits,  
**[0:16:13-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:13):**  so there's fruit in the margins,  there's also fruit in the belts that go across the field.  But in the margins, those are very much designed  
**[0:16:19-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:19):**  to be areas primarily for wildlife.  So that's not to say they won't be grazed every so often.  They might be grazed two or three times a year  
**[0:16:27-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:27):**  just to open things up because the last thing you want  is those areas to entirely scrub up  and then be actually reasonably ecologically undiverse.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:34):**  So occasionally opening those things up,  maybe popping some pigs in just to clear  a little bit of bramble or those sorts of things,  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:40):**  but only in a very, very controlled setting  allowing that to happen.  So the idea for the rest of that fruit and the nuts there  
**[0:16:47-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:47):**  is to ensure that the wildlife that is on my farm  has got a really fantastic source of food available.  So it's making sure that we're not only feeding  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:16:55):**  humans off the farm,  we're making sure that the wildlife and the mammals  and all the birds have a really fantastic habitat here.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:02):**  But then when it comes to the belts themselves,  I want those trees to exhibit that more natural behavior  and get that bit taller to ensure that there are  
**[0:17:09-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:09):**  potentially nesting places for birds  and just a much more kind of natural ecosystem.  It's still a very managed approach.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:16):**  I mean, I've got two rows of trees in every belt  on these 42 meter centers.  So it's not a completely natural thing.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:22):**  It's not a natural woodland.  It's obviously a more managed approach,  but that doesn't mean to say you can't kind of let things  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:29):**  be on the more natural spectrum of it.  And that's kind of how I'm approaching it  and thinking, well, if there is some fallen fruit,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:34):**  I mean, as Johnny said,  you can soon get something in to pick that up and eat it  and still utilize it as useful for your animals.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:39):**  So a phrase I've heard you use in the past  is that there's a sort of secondary harvest,  which is fantastic.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:44):**  Now, George, you've been experimenting, as you said,  nearly eight years with different approaches on your farm.  And whenever I've tried to draw you on this in the past  
**[0:17:53-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:53):**  and sort of talk about your grand designs,  you say, well, actually the grand design is,  I just kind of, I fancy something and I feel interested  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:17:59):**  and I kind of give it a try.  And you've been zero till at least since 2014,  but that's about to change now.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:06):**  You're going to do something different again.  So what's happening and why?  I actually submised my watch  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:11):**  of organic conversion paperwork the other day.  It is only on a small area for a start.  So it's actually on the field  
**[0:18:17-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:17):**  that's got the agroforestry in.  It's the one that's first up for conversion,  but the field next to that is going in  
**[0:18:22-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:22):**  in this autumn as well.  And essentially what I'm doing is  every time I put a field into a herbal lay,  
**[0:18:28-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:28):**  it's going into that organic conversion.  Unfortunately, I've got some land in herbal lays  under stewardship that was done before I wanted to convert.  
**[0:18:35-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:35):**  So I'm hoping I'll be able to just flip that into organic  at the end of that four-year period.  But essentially this is taking a market-led approach.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:42):**  I know that my produce needs to be labeled as organic.  I can't, with the way that I'm selling it  and the people I'm selling it to,  
**[0:18:48-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:48):**  I can't just say I haven't used any pesticides or fertilizer.  They need that kind of label associated with it.  So I kind of embraced that and thought,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:18:55):**  well, that's fair enough.  But I mean, the problem is  when as soon as you say you're going organic,  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:00):**  I say, all right, well, I'm losing glyphosate then.  And in that scenario, I can't be zero till  in the way that I have been zero till previously.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:07):**  And I do need to look at some level of cultivation.  And it was sort of when you take that approach  and having seen the amazing ecological  
**[0:19:14-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:14):**  and habitat benefits of zero tillage,  some really simple ones are kind of,  you go to the middle of an arable field  
**[0:19:20-0:19:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:20):**  and you will find holes in the ground  when your mice hold and things like that,  that habitat's been able to form  
**[0:19:26-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:26):**  because we haven't been moving the soil at all.  We've just been running through with no tillage whatsoever  when we've been establishing those crops.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:32):**  So I want to take the best parts of that and say, right,  well, we will have to plow every so often.  So I'm looking at the fact, as I said earlier,  
**[0:19:38-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:38):**  sort of only 60% of my farm is going to be  in conventional farming,  by which I mean kind of livestock fields or arable fields.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:47):**  And obviously they will rotate.  And so I'm looking at a system of saying, right,  well, if I were to have four years of herbal lace  
**[0:19:52-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:52):**  or really diverse mix of grasses and herbs  and legumes in there,  that's an amazing way of revitalizing my soil,  
**[0:19:58-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:19:58):**  really pounding a load of nutrition in there,  fertility and having a fantastic place to graze livestock.  That can be my fertility build  
**[0:20:06-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:06):**  and the livestock are a great way of me  then making money on that.  But then it also creates that habitat  
**[0:20:11-0:20:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:11):**  that doesn't get disturbed.  And then I'm looking at plowing my way out of that herbal lay  and having a three year arable rotation.  
**[0:20:18-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:18):**  And the reason I don't want to go further than three years  is because by using just three years of arable  in that system, I shouldn't ever get too many weeds.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:25):**  And kind of the way I can kind of be comfortable  with reverting to plowing is saying,  well, it's okay if I plow one year in seven,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:32):**  but what I don't want to be doing  is then doing any other level of cultivation  through that soil throughout that year.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:37):**  So I'm specifically designing a system  that does not require an inter-row hoe.  I want to cultivate the field, sow the field  
**[0:20:43-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:43):**  and not come back until harvest.  So that's it, that's in the first year anyway.  What happens in the second year?  
**[0:20:48-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:48):**  The second and third year, in all likelihood,  there will be spring pulses in this as well.  And potentially then, you know,  
**[0:20:54-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:20:54):**  I'm not quite sure which crops will fit where.  And one of the benefits of my agroforestry scheme  allows me to kind of have loads of different trials  
**[0:21:01-0:21:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:01):**  going on here, which is always exciting.  But yeah, so I'm only aiming to plow once  and that will be shallowly,  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:07):**  but I will be using other minimum tillage approaches  to both destroy the previous crop and establish a new one.  But just making sure that I keep my cultivation window  
**[0:21:17-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:17):**  really, really tight  so that the time I am actually doing 100% disturbance  on those fields is as minimal as possible.  
**[0:21:23-0:21:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:23):**  So give me an example of that.  What, you know, you talked about min tillage techniques.  What sort of thing are you thinking?  
**[0:21:29-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:29):**  So the one that has excited me most,  which I'm really keen to try is,  it's essentially a type of rotavator.  
**[0:21:35-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:35):**  An Italian company called Celli make the one that I've seen  that I'm interested in trying.  And essentially the idea is that it simply goes through  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:41):**  and slices the roots at a specified depth under the soil.  You can set your depth, slices the roots there  and then tosses the top part of the plant  
**[0:21:49-0:21:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:49):**  over behind the machine.  And then means all the roots dry out.  And so that's a way of killing the plant  
**[0:21:53-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:53):**  without inverting your soil.  It is obviously causing soil disturbance,  but my counter to that is saying,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:21:59):**  I'm building so much amazing biodiversity in other areas.  And I've got my biodiversity strips within 18 metres maximum  of any location that has been disturbed,  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:10):**  that is quite likely to recolonise very quickly.  So there is a level of disturbance.  There is a level of destruction,  
**[0:22:15-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:15):**  but I think I can be happy with that.  And are you planning to use ruminants  to sort of manage the land in the winter time as well?  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:22):**  Ruminants will be absolutely critical  in terms of the fertility building period.  So those four year herbal lay periods  
**[0:22:29-0:22:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:29):**  are going to be really, really important  to have ruminants on.  I know there are, I think Johnny's been trying,  
**[0:22:34-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:34):**  doing winter grazing on cereals.  And certainly when we've got a cover crop  in before a spring crop,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:40):**  definitely I'll be aiming to utilise ruminants on that.  And potentially monogastrics as well.  There's nothing maybe wrong with chucking some pigs  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:47):**  across the cover crop as well.  So I'm definitely looking at utilising animals  to manage within that arable system as well.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:22:53):**  So that's to hold down some of the weeds  that might otherwise grow up.  So that when you plant the next year's worth  
**[0:23:00-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:00):**  of cereal crop, it's given a fighting chance.  Exactly, yes.  You've got to make sure that your cash crop  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:06):**  can get up and away.  But once it gets up and away,  provided it's ahead of whatever weeds you've got  
**[0:23:12-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:12):**  and it's vigorous,  I'm hoping that the number of,  the level of weeds we burn within that crop  
**[0:23:17-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:17):**  shouldn't be too large.  Johnny, George mentioned there  that you've already got some experience of that.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:23):**  I wonder if you could share that with us.  We have for a number of years now,  it might even be 60,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:29):**  we've been bringing sheep down from the hills  over the winter and we've been looking after them.  I call it B&B.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:37):**  We've been looking after them over the winter.  We have a very good relationship  with a sheep farmer from 50 miles away.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:44):**  In the past couple of years,  we've been putting those sheep onto our wheat and oats  that we sow in the winter.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:23:54):**  And we've been trying to sow those crops quite early  so that there is a lot of growth,  which we can then eat with the sheep over the winter,  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:02):**  sometimes more than once.  And that cuts down on the need for,  in particular, fungicides,  
**[0:24:09-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:09):**  because it keeps the crops clean,  as well as giving us an income from grazing the sheep  and allowing those cereals to tiller out really nicely  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:19):**  and get closer to their full yield potential.  So you're planting and then as the shoots come up,  they're being nibbled down by the sheep.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:28):**  What does that do?  Does that make the roots stronger?  Well, it tillers out, having been eaten.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:35):**  And because we're putting the fertility back in  that comes out the back of the sheep,  the nutrient cycles get to work properly.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:44):**  Fascinating.  Thank you very much.  And both of you, you're very passionate about what you do  
**[0:24:49-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:49):**  and very passionate about moving away  from the conventional systems that you inherited  and moving to a different system through agroecology  
**[0:24:58-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:24:58):**  to regenerative in one way or another.  Now, Johnny, you've already talked about  some of your regenerative inspiration,  
**[0:25:05-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:05):**  George Monbiot and Alan Savory specifically,  but this goes back a bit further  than those two characters, doesn't it?  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:13):**  So where does your inspiration come from originally?  My inspiration comes from a variety of different places.  I started by reading those books,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:22):**  but I also did some postgraduate study  in sustainable agriculture  and read quite a lot about no till agriculture.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:32):**  So the builders of the cross lot drill, Baker,  he wrote a very good book on no till agriculture.  And I'm now drawing quite a lot of inspiration  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:43):**  from my great, great aunt who founded the Soil Association  and I'm finding her old papers  and really drawing quite a lot of inspiration  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:25:56):**  from the way that in the forties,  they thought of what they were doing with agriculture  and seeing a lot of similarities  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:05):**  in what we're trying to do now.  What you're doing is it's on a large chunk of land  and you're trying to do something quite exciting.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:13):**  Are you unusual in that area  or are there lots of other farmers across Fife  and you're sort of part of Scotland doing the same thing?  
**[0:26:21-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:21):**  I would say I'm not unusual at all.  I'd say there's a big network of farmers  who are looking to improve their land.  
**[0:26:31-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:31):**  In particular in Fife, we have a lot of mob grazers  and dealing with the cattle,  but we also have lots of people  
**[0:26:39-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:39):**  who are looking to push the boundaries  on arable farming as well,  particularly through the organisation base,  
**[0:26:47-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:47):**  which has been really useful  from a knowledge sharing perspective for all of us.  So when you hear in the news or just sort of on social media  
**[0:26:57-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:26:57):**  that farming is just a mining activity,  that's not something that you recognise  in the landscape around you?  
**[0:27:04-0:27:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:04):**  Oh no, I absolutely recognise that  in the landscape around us,  but that doesn't mean that wanting to change that is unique.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:13):**  There are plenty of farmers up and down the country  and around the world who may not be doing everything  that they can to improve their soil,  
**[0:27:22-0:27:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:22):**  but there are still plenty who are.  So for you, you took over,  I think from your father three years ago,  
**[0:27:29-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:29):**  and you've taken the business in a different direction,  which means that your family  that are working on the farm, staff that are coming in,  
**[0:27:35-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:35):**  they've had to move with you.  And I wonder if there are any particular,  what you found the most difficult thing in the transition,  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:43):**  whether it was persuading people to come with you,  or if there was a particular type of crop  that you found more difficult than others.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:27:49):**  And I guess the converse is, what was the easiest?  I was very fortunate that we had quite a long lead time  to me taking over from my father.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:00):**  And throughout that process,  we've had a farm manager who understands  regenerative agriculture  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:09):**  and is looking to further what we're doing  along with what I'm thinking.  So that has been a huge relief, I suppose.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:20):**  And the changes that we've been trying to make  were all started before I was trying to make them,  as it were.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:29):**  And I suppose the most difficult thing  is changing people's mindset.  And that is a whole bunch of people  
**[0:28:38-0:28:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:38):**  that we are involved with,  that I see agriculture as a bunch of interlocking  circular systems from which we get produce.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:48):**  But agriculture, certainly since the Second World War,  has been thought of as a very linear process  with inputs, throughputs, and outputs.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:28:59):**  And changing that mindset from linear to circular  is very, very tricky  and is still taking time.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:09):**  George, have there been moments for you  when you thought to yourself,  yeah, this is it, this is working for me now?  
**[0:29:14-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:14):**  I mean, I think there are always times  you've got to really do yourself up  and have confidence that you're doing the right thing.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:21):**  Because I'll be honest,  when you make the changes that I've been making,  there are plenty of kicks in the goolies  
**[0:29:27-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:27):**  that you get along the way.  So a few case in points would be kind of issues I've had  with heritage wheat establishment,  
**[0:29:34-0:29:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:34):**  just because I didn't manage to get on in time this year,  and I've got a very patchy establishment of that,  and it wasn't great last year either,  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:41):**  just due to the fact that timeliness,  and to be honest, the state that our soils are in,  which is why I'm implementing so many changes.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:48):**  So I would say that on the whole,  that mostly I've had to have a little bit of faith  in what I'm doing,  
**[0:29:54-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:54):**  but there are a few little glimmers  that you really know are good.  And I think for me, kind of,  
**[0:29:59-0:30:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:29:59):**  you go and stick a herbal layer in the ground  and get it established,  and you go and have a look at that a year later.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:04):**  And I don't tend to go around with a spade  like some farmers,  but I have a very useful knife that works like a trowel.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:10):**  So I tend to go out and stick my knife in the ground  and have a look in there.  And quite simply, the change associated with the soil  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:18):**  from a year of having a genuinely diverse herbal layer,  to an unctuously brown, deliciously,  like the smell of the soil,  
**[0:30:26-0:30:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:26):**  like you genuinely want to eat it.  Pretty sure it's gritty, I don't recommend it.  And then as well as that,  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:31):**  like the look of these herbal layers as well,  when you go in them, I mean, for a start,  I have actually had people noticing herbal layers saying,  
**[0:30:37-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:37):**  oh, wow, these look, there's lots going on here.  And as well as that, they got tons of flowers.  And I'm someone who likes things to be pretty  
**[0:30:44-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:44):**  and to be beautiful.  And the flowers that you get within a herbal layer  are pretty superb.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:48):**  And I have this thing where I like to kind of stop  on the farm and have a little sit easier  when it's not been raining,  
**[0:30:54-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:54):**  so you don't get a wet bottom.  But it's nice to have a little bit of a sit on the ground  in somewhere interesting and focus on the nature  
**[0:30:59-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:30:59):**  and what's going on around you.  And I think that's when you can then see  the amount of insect life,  
**[0:31:04-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:04):**  the amount of tiny flies and beetles  and all kind of weird stuff going on.  And so I suppose that for me is the stuff  
**[0:31:10-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:10):**  that I'm really showing me I'm winning,  is the introduction of genuine levels of diversity  in the cropping that I've got  
**[0:31:17-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:17):**  or the plants that I'm sowing,  and seeing that uptick in diversity  when I do stop and take a chance  
**[0:31:23-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:23):**  to actually look at what's going on around me.  One of the things that seems to help you  is that you seem to be able to think in the longer term.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:29):**  You've mentioned to me before about disease.  If there's a disease in part of a crop in one year,  then rather than writing it off just in terms of that year  
**[0:31:38-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:38):**  and thinking that's been a bad year,  in your mind you seem to write it off over several years.  And I wonder if your past life as a banker helps with that.  
**[0:31:46-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:46):**  Well, I suppose that the banking part means  that I've sat down and written myself a costing spreadsheet  and really kind of have a pretty tight grip  
**[0:31:55-0:31:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:31:55):**  on actually what things cost.  And I coupled that with the fact  that traditionally farming has always been  
**[0:32:00-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:00):**  a generational opportunity.  It's not been an annual cost exercise.  And the issue is that since we've been  
**[0:32:08-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:08):**  spooning everything on, everything's come out of the bag,  it's enabled us over the last 50 years  to go very much to an annual form of looking at the farm.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:16):**  But we know that farming is breaking.  Though I'm sure there are farmers out there  with their heads in the sand about this,  
**[0:32:21-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:21):**  but most people, if they're honest with themselves,  know that the current way of farming doesn't work.  And so consequently, I think it's when you,  
**[0:32:28-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:28):**  when you look at it and you say,  all right, well, I have got a little issue here.  And again, my costing spreadsheet  
**[0:32:33-0:32:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:33):**  will tell me how much that is.  But if you couple that kind of analytical financial data  with actually going out and really looking  
**[0:32:41-0:32:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:41):**  at what's going on with your crop.  And so, you know, the instance you're talking about  was an instance I've had with not using insecticides.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:47):**  And this was the fact that in a single year,  I think probably across the entire farm,  my BYDV, this is a virus you get in wheat  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:32:55):**  called Bala Yellow Dwarf Virus,  that comes about and you'll get patches in your wheat  with severely impacted yield.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:03):**  In one field, it was down sort of maybe a ton and a half,  two tonne a hectare, but overall the entire farm,  I think I was down around about half a tonne a hectare  
**[0:33:11-0:33:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:11):**  and where I should have been.  But I haven't had issues  for the four or five years before that.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:15):**  So rather than saying you've had  a half a tonne a hectare yield deficit,  actually you've had maybe 0.1 of a tonne a hectare,  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:21):**  which in today's prices is 20 pounds a hectare  that you've cost yourself.  All right, now in theory, probably  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:27):**  insecticides are a little bit cheaper than that, maybe,  but look at all the amazing benefits  that you're able to have by saying,  
**[0:33:34-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:34):**  you know what, I'm not going to use insecticides.  And this is across the board with fungicides as well,  with nitrogen usage.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:41):**  And it's sunny that looking a little bit more long term  on how you're structuring a farm system  can really change your kind of how you see  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:49):**  the issues you've got on your farm.  And in terms of that cost differential,  by the time there's an organic label on there,  
**[0:33:55-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:33:55):**  which adds value from a customer perspective,  then potentially you're out ahead in the end anyway.  Jonny, you've talked to me before about the fact  
**[0:34:04-0:34:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:04):**  that this is the first year for you  that you're going completely no nitrogen  on all of your pastures.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:10):**  What led you to taking that decision?  Simply that we don't need them anymore  because we're managing our grazing differently  
**[0:34:19-0:34:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:19):**  in order to get more life in the soil  and therefore not be mining the roots of our pastures.  And therefore the grass grows better.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:30):**  It's for the same reason that if we manage cover crops  in our arable land in this way,  we can put energy back into the soil  
**[0:34:42-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:42):**  and reduce our nitrogen requirements  in arable crops afterwards as well.  So this is the first step for us in reducing nitrogen  
**[0:34:54-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:34:54):**  on a whole variety of crops.  The first one that we're doing is pasture.  Fantastic.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:00):**  And George, it would be fair to say  that you're not the world's greatest fan of nitrogen.  No, exactly.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:05):**  And so, I mean, to be clear, I am still using nitrogen now,  but it's obviously coming out of my system  in a big, big way.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:10):**  And besides reducing it in crops,  I'm obviously eliminating it from a lot of others.  So my heritage-  
**[0:35:15-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:15):**  Sorry, while we're talking about this,  I really should make it clear.  We're talking about synthetic nitrogen  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:19):**  rather than the natural nitrogen that's in the system.  Yes, exactly.  And certainly, you know,  
**[0:35:24-0:35:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:24):**  I haven't been using nitrogen on my heritage wheats  and I think it's a beneficial thing.  But I mean, if we look back at the earlier thing  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:31):**  I said about BYDV.  So BYDV is a virus which is spread by aphids.  It's carried on aphids.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:37):**  And so people seem to think that they need to target  the aphid as the problem.  That's the problem.  
**[0:35:42-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:42):**  And in fact, actually the aphid is much closer  to being a symptom of an underlying issue with your crop.  And essentially over use of nitrogen in the past,  
**[0:35:50-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:50):**  we've got these really kind of soils  full of synthetic nitrogen,  which cause all these kind of imbalances in crop nutrition.  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:35:56):**  And that's the reason which opens up our crops  to attacks from things like aphids,  but also attacks from diseases as well.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:04):**  And we really need to get a grasp  on how nitrogen works on our farms  because that's how we get away from these pest issues.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:10):**  We can't, you know,  there are lots of people who want to use technology  to get away from this technology and plant breeding  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:15):**  and gene editing and potentially GMOs,  which is probably a rabbit hole.  We don't want to go down now,  
**[0:36:20-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:20):**  other than the fact, I think everyone knows  that I'm not pro any of those things.  And in fact, actually we just need to sort out  
**[0:36:25-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:25):**  our farming system.  And a lot of those things are benchmarked on nitrogen use.  We're coming to the end of the programme now.  
**[0:36:31-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:31):**  And I just wonder whether there are things  that you would do differently if you had your time again.  You know, things that you perhaps do faster  
**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:38):**  or things that you just rather forget about altogether.  Jonny, what about you?  I'm so near the beginning of this process.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:45):**  I'm not sure that in an agricultural cycle,  I could go much quicker.  I would have loved to have got more fences  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:36:53):**  and more fields more quickly.  We could get more animals into more fields more often,  but that's very simple.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:00):**  And I just want to continue on this journey  for as long as possible.  And George, what about you?  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:06):**  Are there things that you'd do differently?  The biggest thing would be actually,  and I think I knew it really early on that we needed  
**[0:37:12-0:37:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:12):**  to stick herbal lays in and do a lot of them.  And I've heard loads of people say, you know,  they did a herbal lay once and they kind of played it through.  
**[0:37:20-0:37:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:20):**  And then by the time they established their next one,  they wished they'd put the whole of the farm in previously.  So I think kind of, I've seen herbal lays as being  
**[0:37:27-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:27):**  such an amazing benefit to really fixing problems  that I've had in the farm.  You know, I've tried farming my way out of issues  
**[0:37:33-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:33):**  in a conventional way in an annual system and you can't.  You just make more problems.  And those fields that I've got those issues  
**[0:37:42-0:37:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:42):**  are now going into herbal lays.  They should have been in much, much sooner.  Also, I mean, my agroforestry,  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:47):**  that's literally been in the works for five years.  And I would, you know,  if I could have done that five years ago,  
**[0:37:51-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:51):**  to be five years more advanced,  trees that are five years old versus just gone in the ground,  that would have been absolutely huge  
**[0:37:58-0:37:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:37:58):**  if I could have done that.  But then again, had I established that five years ago,  the scheme would have been so simplistic  
**[0:38:03-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:03):**  that it wouldn't have anywhere near the benefits  it's got now.  So I think, I mean, I'm pushing incredibly hard  
**[0:38:08-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:08):**  with a lot of projects on the farm.  And to be honest, I wish they were all done yesterday,  two years ago, five years ago.  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Arable-farming---Putting-agroecology-into-practice-eqsva7#t=0:38:16):**  But yeah, we're getting there.  We're getting there.  Fantastic.

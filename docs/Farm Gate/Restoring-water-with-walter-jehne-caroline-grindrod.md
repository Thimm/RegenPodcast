**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. This episode is the recording of a recent webinar, Restoring  
**[0:00:10-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:10):**  the Water Cycle, with Walter Jayner and Caroline Grindrod.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:14):**  Hello, everybody. Thanks so much for taking the time to be with us this morning. My name's  
**[0:00:19-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:19):**  Finlow Costayne. I'm the chief executive of Farmwell and founder of the Food and Global  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:23):**  Security Network. Now, the Food and Global Security Network is interested primarily in  
**[0:00:28-0:00:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:28):**  two key things. The first is how we maintain a peaceful society in the face of ecological  
**[0:00:34-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:34):**  breakdown. And the second is, well, how do we mitigate the worst impacts of that ecological  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:39):**  breakdown in the first place? And for us, food and food systems are at the centre of  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:44):**  that. How we produce food, how we transport and consume food, how we make meals, these  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:50):**  are all critical to answering those key questions. And the Food and Global Security Network is  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:00:56):**  a web of informed individuals, researchers, NGO leaders and campaigners from around the  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:02):**  world, from the USA to New Zealand, through Australia, Africa, Europe and, of course,  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:07):**  the United Kingdom. And the thing that binds us together is a passion for food systems,  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:13):**  for nutritional security, because food security in and of itself isn't enough. We need good  
**[0:01:19-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:19):**  nutrient-dense food to be available affordably, for all, and we cannot have food security  
**[0:01:26-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:26):**  if we don't have good functioning agricultural land. Now, many of you may well have taken  
**[0:01:31-0:01:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:31):**  part in webinars on this platform in the past. You may even have read our Soil Health, Soil  
**[0:01:36-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:36):**  and Security report. And you'll know that we review soil health as absolutely integral  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:42):**  to these questions of the future. The soil health is the essential building block of  
**[0:01:48-0:01:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:48):**  biodiversity, because biodiversity cascades from below ground up through the food web.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:54):**  But, of course, we can't have functioning soil without sunlight and without water. And  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:01:59):**  it's water that we're here to talk about today, water cycles and hydrological systems about  
**[0:02:05-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:05):**  how it's critical to restore that hydrology if we are to rebalance the Earth's climate,  
**[0:02:10-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:10):**  to restore biodiversity and ensure that we have secure food systems for the future. And,  
**[0:02:16-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:16):**  of course, water is truly amazing stuff. It's an alien substance that arrived here on Earth  
**[0:02:22-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:22):**  hundreds of millions of years after the Earth itself was formed, and which we and the food  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:28):**  systems that we rely on just simply wouldn't exist without it. And so, for billions of  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:33):**  years, this substance has cycled and recycled through rocks and mountains, plants and animals,  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:40):**  through oceans and ice caps, and, of course, through the sky. And water in the way that  
**[0:02:44-0:02:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:44):**  hydrological function changes is also key to the story of climate change. Climate change  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:50):**  isn't just about carbon, it's about hydrological function, as water will explain in just a  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:02:57):**  moment. And, of course, when we're thinking about the impacts of climate change, we're  
**[0:03:01-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:01):**  thinking about the impacts of water, storms, hurricanes, floods. These are the impacts  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:07):**  of climate change, and they're part of the story of water. And the converse of that,  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:12):**  the heat waves and the droughts that many of us have experienced across the last few  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:16):**  months, the wildfires, they're part of the story of the absence of water. So, water is  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:22):**  at the centre of the climate change story, and we need to better understand it if we're  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:27):**  to mitigate and adapt to face the ecological crises that are now underway. Now, today,  
**[0:03:34-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:34):**  I'm really pleased to say that we're joined by two truly exceptional people. Walter Jayner  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:39):**  is the world-renowned soil microbiologist and expert in hydrological systems. He's also  
**[0:03:46-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:46):**  the founder of Regenerate Earth. And Caroline Grindrod is a consultant and coach in regenerative  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:52):**  agriculture, and her consultancy is called Roots of Nature. So, welcome to both of you.  
**[0:03:58-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:03:58):**  As I say, welcome to everybody that's joining us today and who will be joining us through  
**[0:04:03-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:03):**  the YouTube film and through the Farmgate broadcast of this webinar in the future. Our  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:09):**  intention is to have a discussion for about 40 minutes and then to spend the last 15 or  
**[0:04:14-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:14):**  20 minutes of this session having questions from you in the audience. So, without further  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:20):**  ado, Walter, you said that global warming and the prevention of climate extremes isn't  
**[0:04:26-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:26):**  just about carbon, but also hydrology. What do you mean?  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:29):**  Right. Well, thank you very much, Finlay, and thank you very much, everybody, for attending.  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:35):**  And yeah, look, to explain the situation, we actually have two different issues here,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:39):**  haven't we? We've got the issue of global warming, and then we've got the issue of climate  
**[0:04:44-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:44):**  extremes. And in a sense, they epitomise the dilemma. There's no question that 60 years  
**[0:04:51-0:04:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:51):**  ago, Charles Keeling gave us the evidence that CO2 was going up abnormally. And basically,  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:04:57):**  this was due to the oxidation or had been due to the oxidation of carbon from our soils,  
**[0:05:02-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:02):**  from our landscape burning well before our profligate use of fossil fuels. So, yes, here  
**[0:05:08-0:05:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:08):**  was a symptom, a CO2 increase from oxidation of carbon. And yes, CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:16):**  So, yes, it has this global warming effect. No question at all about those facts. But  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:22):**  we've got to make sure we don't confuse symptoms with causes and certainly that we don't restrict  
**[0:05:27-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:27):**  our responses to just cleaning up symptoms because the causes are much deeper. But the  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:33):**  second part of your question gets more scary, actually, because it's prevention of climate  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:38):**  extremes, dangerous hydrological climate extremes. And this was brought to the fore, the Hadley  
**[0:05:44-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:44):**  Centre in 2005. Really, what are the dangerous hydrological extremes? And as you mentioned,  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:51):**  the hurricanes, the floods, the droughts, the wildfires, the systemic eradication. And  
**[0:05:57-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:05:57):**  these are all hydrological, right? They're not basically CO2, they're hydrological and  
**[0:06:03-0:06:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:03):**  hydrologically impacts extremes, kill people, destroy biosystem and comes to your key issue,  
**[0:06:11-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:11):**  food security, because basically it's hydrology, chiefly that governs whether we can grow food.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:18):**  There are seven missed meals between social stability and chaos, basically, and it's that  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:25):**  hydrology that governs whether there are those seven meals available. So it's really quite  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:31):**  fundamental. So water becomes much, much more critical. Okay, so we've got these two different  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:37):**  concepts we've confused, global warming and dangerous hydrological extremes, one's long-term  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:43):**  and one's, of course, short-terms and impacting a society level. But they all basically all  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:49):**  linked together because the climate, 95% of the heat dynamics of the blue planet for the  
**[0:06:56-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:06:56):**  last 4 billion years has been driven by hydrological processes, 95% of that heat dynamics. The  
**[0:07:04-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:04):**  CO2 component of the greenhouse effect does about 4%. Okay, so we've got this sort of  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:10):**  the elephants in not in the room, they're far too big, you know, it's hydrology. And  
**[0:07:15-0:07:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:15):**  really, we are now after 60 years of talk, talk, talk, meetings, meetings, but no action.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:22):**  We're now at this point of dangerous hydrological extremes impacting, destroying bio systems,  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:29):**  threatening communities. And we've really got to address the question, how do we actually  
**[0:07:33-0:07:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:33):**  manage this hydrology, but also how do we safely naturally cool the climate? Because  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:40):**  it's way too late, decades too late to think that just emission reductions are going to  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:47):**  sort of turn that 4% of the greenhouse gas effect that is driven by CO2, that that can  
**[0:07:53-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:07:53):**  actually safely cool the climate in time. So we both have hydrology is critical for  
**[0:08:00-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:00):**  essential food production, keeping bio systems alive, but it's also hydrology that's essential  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:06):**  for cooling the planet safely and naturally. The good news is, yes, we can do it. But we've  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:12):**  got to start debating and talking and acting on this new reality.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:17):**  In your view, is it possible to solve global warming without a primary focus on hydrological  
**[0:08:24-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:24):**  cycles and in particular, the restoration of the soil carbon sponge?  
**[0:08:28-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:28):**  Well, look, thank you. And that's really the critical thing. No, it is not possible to  
**[0:08:33-0:08:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:33):**  solve the climate crisis without hydrology. It's, as we said, 95% of the driver through  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:39):**  various processes. So yes, that's where the agency is. And the other news is, yes, regenerating  
**[0:08:46-0:08:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:46):**  the earth's soil carbon sponge is actually the thing that nature used to create the bio  
**[0:08:54-0:09:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:08:54):**  system we evolved in and depend on. And it's our point of agency, we can do that as well  
**[0:09:00-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:00):**  as nature did. So the real simple take home message is, yes, we can still influence the  
**[0:09:06-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:06):**  climate but by restoring natural safe hydrological cooling. And we can do that by regenerating  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:13):**  the earth's soil carbon sponge, because it's that oxidation degradation of the sponge,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:19):**  which has given the CO2 symptom, but is also completely compromised the hydrological capacity,  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:26):**  buffering and functioning of the ecosystem. Many people listening will have heard of the  
**[0:09:31-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:31):**  concept of the soil carbon sponge, but I wonder if you could just explain that term for us.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:36):**  Okay, well, the sponge is simply a matter of basically here are mineral detritus and  
**[0:09:42-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:42):**  organic detritus mixed up together through natural pedogenesis soil forming processes.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:49):**  And by mixing these together, they create an open loose matrix, three dimensional matrix,  
**[0:09:55-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:09:55):**  which can infiltrate, retain and make available water and nutrients. And that is enabled then  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:02):**  plants to flourish across the whole 29% of the land surface of this planet. And of course,  
**[0:10:08-0:10:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:08):**  it's those plants through their transpiration and their hydrological function, the air conditioners  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:14):**  of this planet. Okay, so the sponge is really the change from mineral hard compacted mineral  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:21):**  rock, impervious rock to an open loose porous matrix, which gives you agency through its  
**[0:10:27-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:27):**  hydrological infiltration retention availability. Now that agency comes in, it's again, very  
**[0:10:33-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:33):**  simple. If we look at global warming, we've got a planet, we're getting 342 watts per  
**[0:10:39-0:10:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:39):**  square metre incident solar energy continually onto the surface of the troposphere. And basically  
**[0:10:45-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:45):**  global warming, we're retaining an extra three watts per square metre abnormally. So it's  
**[0:10:51-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:51):**  less than 1% of the incident solar radiation. So we've got this challenge of how can we  
**[0:10:57-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:10:57):**  rebalance, re-correct a 1% extra heat retention by the planet, that solar radiation that isn't  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:05):**  being readmitted. And so how do we manage the sponge and how do we manage vegetation  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:11):**  and the different hydrological processes we can go into to give us that 1% return of solar  
**[0:11:18-0:11:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:18):**  radiation back out to space to rebalance the heat dynamics of the planet. So when we look  
**[0:11:24-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:24):**  at it in that context, it's a 1% rebalancing and it's totally doable safely naturally  
**[0:11:31-0:11:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:31):**  as nature did. But we've got to face that reality, look at those processes, because  
**[0:11:37-0:11:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:37):**  at the moment, we're still in la-la land dreaming just about carbon accounting, rather  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:43):**  than the actual functional role of carbon, the sponge and hydrology in the planet's  
**[0:11:48-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:48):**  air conditioning.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:49):**  And of course, when there isn't a functioning soil carbon sponge, when the land is compacted,  
**[0:11:54-0:11:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:54):**  and essentially just goes back to rock, the water will just run off. But when there is  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:11:59):**  a functioning soil carbon sponge, that water will be absorbed into the earth and held in  
**[0:12:03-0:12:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:03):**  the earth and released as nature requires it.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:06):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:07):**  Caroline, can you sort of take us a bit further now in terms of our understanding of hydrological  
**[0:12:12-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:12):**  systems, our understanding of the soil carbon sponge, but what role now do regenerative  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:18):**  farmers play in restoring that water cycling and restoring a functioning soil carbon sponge?  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:24):**  Thanks, Finlow, and thanks for inviting me and for everyone that's here. So, yeah,  
**[0:12:28-0:12:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:28):**  it's great. So Walter, obviously, if anyone's heard him talk before, he talks about all  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:32):**  these different sort of global climatic functions of the water cycle, which is incredible, as  
**[0:12:37-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:37):**  I say, rethinking the carbon thing and seeing how could these, all these different effects  
**[0:12:42-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:42):**  from clouds to transpiration to dampening the dust down and then of course, the carbon  
**[0:12:47-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:47):**  sponge, how does that, how do we take that from a kind of macro climate function to what  
**[0:12:53-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:53):**  we can change on the ground? And that's kind of what I get more involved in. So perhaps  
**[0:12:57-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:12:57):**  the best way to approach this question is to go through the water cycle as we teach  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:00):**  it to regenerative farmers, you can see the kind of the small water cycle and how we can  
**[0:13:05-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:05):**  genuinely impact that on the ground, because ultimately, this disruption, this climate  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:10):**  derangement is what's going to stop food being produced, isn't it? So we can buffer that  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:15):**  hugely within our farming practices on a farm by farm basis. So, so what we're really trying  
**[0:13:20-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:20):**  to do in regenerative agriculture is we're trying to create whole system ecological function  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:26):**  for the continuous primary production. So essentially, we're trying to grow more green  
**[0:13:30-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:30):**  plants, for the benefit of cooling the planet, for the benefit of the wildlife, and for the  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:35):**  benefit of the farm that can then make a profit from either grazing animals or eating directly  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:39):**  those green plants. So really, what we need to think about is how do we slow the flow  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:44):**  of rainfall to make it effective so that we are capturing every bit that falls onto the  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:49):**  surface, retaining it for as long as possible, recharging our rivers and our aquifers, and  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:54):**  then making sure that that's leading through a plant that's made use of it, essentially,  
**[0:13:58-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:13:58):**  and then it can be transferred back out into the atmosphere to be made use of by these  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:01):**  climate functions. So in a practical sense, what we can do as farmers on the ground is  
**[0:14:06-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:06):**  we can look at every part of that raindrops journey. So the first most important thing  
**[0:14:10-0:14:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:10):**  is does that raindrop fall directly onto bare soil, because if it falls onto bare soil,  
**[0:14:16-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:16):**  really what happens is, it's a little bit like I liken it to tamping concrete, you get  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:21):**  all the findings come to the surface, and it creates an impervious kind of layer. And  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:26):**  in our part of the world in the UK, where it's moist, that tends to make a and stop  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:30):**  airflow and we get a slimy surface, but then when it gets hot, and in the drylands, the  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:34):**  world that creates a really hard cap. And then what happens, of course, is that when  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:38):**  it does rain, the water runs straight off the surface and over the surface, instead  
**[0:14:42-0:14:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:42):**  of going into the into the soil structure. So that's really important first step is we  
**[0:14:46-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:46):**  need vegetated soil. So we need the raindrop to hit either a tree or tall plants, and not  
**[0:14:53-0:14:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:53):**  directly onto the soil. And the whole process of hitting a tall plant, whether that be a  
**[0:14:57-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:14:57):**  tall grass plant or a hedge is that that can, you know, break the impact and it can trickle  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:02):**  and slow that process of the water going into the soil profile. So anything that's growing  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:07):**  tall as well has deep roots. So the idea is that we, we slow the raindrop and then we  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:12):**  help it through capillary actions that would go into the soil profile rather than across  
**[0:15:16-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:16):**  the surface. So that's the first part we can manage our grazing, we can manage our systems  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:21):**  that we never leave the soil bare. And then you've got to think right, well, then you  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:24):**  get down to the soil surface level. So in an ideal world, we want some sort of protection  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:29):**  on the soil surface so that we can once we've got the water into the soil, we keep it in  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:32):**  the soil, and ideally a kind of decaying mulch on the soil surface, which is fabulous because  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:38):**  it feeds worms and all the biology that's going to be making holes and little crevices  
**[0:15:43-0:15:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:43):**  in the soil to let the water infiltrate and penetrate. But also it stops the evaporation.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:49):**  So that literally keeps a soggy sponge on the surface and prevents all the water that  
**[0:15:54-0:15:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:54):**  has fallen onto the surface from just simply evaporating out, which it does on bare soil.  
**[0:15:59-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:15:59):**  And then it stops the wind and on all of that process that are drying that up. So we're  
**[0:16:02-0:16:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:02):**  making effective use of any water that comes onto our soil. So and then we, we want to  
**[0:16:07-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:07):**  make sure that we've got lots of diversity as well. So each plant, we want pole plants,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:11):**  but we also want lots of different species of plant because each different species has  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:15):**  what we call different root architecture, each plant, some will have fibrous roots,  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:19):**  some will have long tap roots. And that means that the water has been kind of put into different  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:23):**  layers in the soil right down to the depths. Diversity is also really important because  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:28):**  it helps to create soil aggregation. So basically having lots of species working together, all  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:33):**  exuding different cocktails of root exudates helps to form these little balls of soil that  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:39):**  are bound up by glues, biological glues, and they're like hollow balls of soil that then  
**[0:16:44-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:44):**  help to retain the water. And it also helps the water go into deeper layers. So we do  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:48):**  all of those things, then we, with diverse pastures or, you know, woodlands or whatever  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:53):**  we're working with, then we should get the development of mycorrhizal fungi and networks  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:16:57):**  as well. And that's sort of like, you then get really big aggregates all pulling together.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:01):**  And then you also get plants that can connect up with these super roots, this mycorrhizal  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:06):**  fungi that allows the penetration of the water into those layers, but also the plants can  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:10):**  then get into the tiny little crevices and explore the soil that we wouldn't normally  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:14):**  be able to access the water from under normal circumstances. So in a nutshell, in our regenerative  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:20):**  system, what we're looking for is not disturbing the soil, making sure we're keeping a habitat  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:24):**  of microorganisms that can do all of that stuff and bind up the soil aggregates, protect  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:29):**  the soil surface by trampling and allowing plants to grow tall, ensuring our swards are  
**[0:17:33-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:33):**  diverse through proper management, rest and recovery, and that sort of thing.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:37):**  Thanks so much, Caroline, for that overview. And I guess the next question, especially,  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:41):**  you know, when we're talking about climate change and the way in which so many people  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:46):**  have a bad view of the role of ruminants, how integral are ruminants to this process  
**[0:17:51-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:51):**  and these processes that you've been talking about?  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:54):**  So when we're talking about grasslands in particular, and Walter mentioned the figures  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:17:59):**  on desertification, it's a huge, fast area. And, you know, a lot of our land base is grassland,  
**[0:18:05-0:18:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:05):**  you know, naturally. And herbivores, you know, grasslands co-evolved with herbivores. So  
**[0:18:10-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:10):**  the process, particularly in the dry lands is absolutely key, you know, having herbivores  
**[0:18:15-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:15):**  and ruminants in that system. So how it would, you know, originally it would just that those  
**[0:18:19-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:19):**  animals in very large numbers would be predated by their pack hunting predators, that would  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:25):**  mean that they would be bunching and moving together. And in the dry lands where you've  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:29):**  got seasonal rainfall, you end up with a big flush of vegetation growing in the, when there's  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:33):**  moisture around, it gets very tall. And then because in the dry season, there isn't that  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:39):**  like here, we can just decay and digest plant material all year round. But in the dry lands,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:45):**  that doesn't happen because it's just too hot and too dry. So that natural decay process  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:50):**  doesn't happen on its own. And then what tends to happen is that it bakes the soil surface,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:55):**  the soil surface becomes open and bare, because the minerals are essentially locked up in  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:18:59):**  that tall vegetation. And then because the soil is getting very hot in the sun up to,  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:04):**  you know, I'm not sure what temperatures Walter could tell us perhaps, but you know, very  
**[0:19:08-0:19:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:08):**  high temperatures where, you know, at 60 degrees, microbes die essentially. So the digestion  
**[0:19:13-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:13):**  process from those microbes in the soil isn't available. So animals in that bunching and  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:20):**  moving kind of mob would go through, knock that vegetation to the floor, eat it, because  
**[0:19:26-0:19:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:26):**  essentially their gut is full of those microbes that can digest that plant material, they  
**[0:19:30-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:30):**  would dung it and urinate it onto the grass. Because they're in a big mob, they would then  
**[0:19:35-0:19:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:35):**  have to leave that area and not come back for some time. And that process is allowing  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:39):**  the mineral cycle to continue through the dry season. And then when it does rain, instead  
**[0:19:44-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:44):**  of the rain falling onto hard-capped soil, and then rushing straight off the surface  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:50):**  into the rivers, flooding everything, and then we've lost that rainfall for that whole  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:53):**  season, then the sort of decaying mulch on the surface from that trampling and manure  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:19:58):**  will allow that to be soaked up and then sort of perpetuate growth through the next season.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:03):**  So in the drylands, incredibly important that we've got at least something mimicking that  
**[0:20:07-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:07):**  process. So if we haven't got the wild herbivores in that system, we need to mob animals together  
**[0:20:12-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:12):**  in a management system to mimic that. And of course, as soon as you start to fence animals  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:17):**  in and take away their predators, they no longer have to do that bunching trampling  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:21):**  process. Therefore, they can just choose what they want to eat. They can nibble down the  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:26):**  roots, which means nibble down the plants, which means the roots get short, and that  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:31):**  doesn't allow the water to go in and the whole thing starts to desertify and that process  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:35):**  begins. So drylands incredibly important, but even in moist areas of what we call non-brittle  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:41):**  and holistic management in the UK, what you're seeing is, particularly on the uplands, and  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:46):**  a lot of the east of the country now is starting to see these processes happen. You know, you've  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:51):**  got set stocking of animals that are selectively grazing the whole year round, it takes away  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:20:56):**  the litter, it keeps the plant short, and you're seeing this even on the, you know,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:01):**  and again in the uplands where you've got a lot of the fertility washed out of the system  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:04):**  through high rainfall, and then you've got very acidic soils, you're actually getting  
**[0:21:07-0:21:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:07):**  a very brittle type environment where things go rank, and you've got the same sort of processes.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:12):**  So yeah, very important to have herbivores as part of that system.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:15):**  Jason Vale – Well, so coming back to you, perhaps you could pick up on the issue around  
**[0:21:20-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:20):**  temperatures on arid land versus grassland. But clearly when we're thinking about the  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:26):**  role of ruminants in drawing carbon out of the air and managing hydrology, we can see  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:31):**  that that's hugely important. But I wonder whether regenerative livestock management  
**[0:21:36-0:21:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:36):**  is actually able to not only slow global warming and sequester carbon, but physically cool  
**[0:21:42-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:42):**  the planet as well.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:44):**  David Tingley – Yeah, okay, very important. And to picking up from what Caroline said,  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:47):**  yeah, we've got about 6 billion hectares, or 40% of the land surface made up with grassland.  
**[0:21:54-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:21:54):**  If it wasn't for herbivores, then those grasslands would just grow up, rank, dry, burn, and return  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:01):**  to desert. Okay, so this is fundamental. The herbivores are essential symbionts for those  
**[0:22:07-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:07):**  grasslands, evolved together fairly recently, 100 million years, and really essential for  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:14):**  those biosystems. And as Caroline has explained that that grass growth then allows that system  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:20):**  to infiltrate water into the sponge, and of course, give that hydrological cycle. You  
**[0:22:26-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:26):**  don't have that in a mineral desert. And it's that hydrological cycle that of course gives  
**[0:22:31-0:22:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:31):**  us our cooling potential. I mean, we won't go into it in all detail, but basically there's  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:36):**  five key hydrological processes that grassland vegetation foster, which wouldn't happen if  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:43):**  it was a desert. I mean, the first one is just simply evapotranspiration, latent heat  
**[0:22:49-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:49):**  going from the surface back up into the atmosphere and out to space with water basically turning  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:22:56):**  from a liquid into a gas. And that takes about 24% of the incident solar radiation from the  
**[0:23:02-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:02):**  surface back into the atmosphere and space cooling that surface. Okay, wouldn't happen  
**[0:23:08-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:08):**  unless you had hydrology. The same thing happens at hydrology within the air, it'll then nucleate  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:15):**  to form clouds. Those clouds reflect incident solar radiation directly back out to space.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:21):**  And again, that does about 33% of the planet's natural cooling. So increased clouds, you  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:28):**  can increase natural cooling. Also, of course, when those clouds condense, they return the  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:33):**  rain to the soil, but remove the water vapour from the air. The water vapour is actually  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:39):**  the dominant greenhouse gas, 80% of the greenhouse gas effect is water vapour. And that reopens  
**[0:23:45-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:45):**  in nighttime radiation windows that allows heat to escape at night, where otherwise it  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:52):**  would be trapped by that water vapour. And that does about 20% of the cooling. But just  
**[0:23:57-0:24:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:23:57):**  very briefly, the most important and interesting and powerful point of agency we have is if  
**[0:24:03-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:03):**  we have grassland, which is green, protected and shaded, then the soil under those grasslands,  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:10):**  even in tropical areas rarely gets above 20 degrees centigrade. By contrast, an open bare  
**[0:24:17-0:24:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:17):**  exposed soil desert landscape can easily get to 70 degrees plus surface temperature. And  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:25):**  it's a simple rule of physics, and it's capable on anywhere in the universe, that the amount  
**[0:24:30-0:24:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:30):**  of reradiation from a substance is the fourth power of its temperature in degrees Kelvin.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:38):**  Simple physics, right, which means that it's temperature times temperature times temperature  
**[0:24:43-0:24:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:43):**  times temperature. So a hot, dry desert at 70 degrees centigrade reradiates massively  
**[0:24:51-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:51):**  more heat than a cool, protected, moist grassland at 20 degrees centigrade. Now the punchline  
**[0:24:58-0:25:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:24:58):**  is simply this, the greenhouse effect is governed by the amount of reradiation, factor one,  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:05):**  times the percentage of that reradiation which is then absorbed by greenhouse gases, of which  
**[0:25:12-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:12):**  CO2 is 11%, water vapours 80%, methane and other gases 9%. Okay, so the greenhouse effect  
**[0:25:20-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:20):**  is governed by the amount of reradiation times the percentage absorbed by gases. But by keeping  
**[0:25:27-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:27):**  land surfaces grazed, cool, protected, we can turn down the amount of reradiation through  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:36):**  this simple Stefan-Boltzmann physics, the reradiation physics, we can in fact turn down  
**[0:25:42-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:42):**  the greenhouse effect radically, instantaneously, even if we're not having to change the greenhouse  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:48):**  gases in the air, because greenhouse gases can't absorb heat that has been reradiated,  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:25:54):**  logically. Okay, and so we've got in a sense the stove, we can turn the stove from ultra  
**[0:26:00-0:26:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:00):**  high to simmer by just keeping landscapes cool, moist and protected. And nature does  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:08):**  that through grasslands, grazing ecologies over 6 billion hectares of this planet. And  
**[0:26:15-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:15):**  therefore us regenerating those ecological grazing systems to maintain the sponge, to  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:22):**  maintain hydrology, to maintain grasslands are critically powerful in giving us a cooling  
**[0:26:29-0:26:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:29):**  agency on this planet. The beautiful thing is we can do this over vast areas. And we  
**[0:26:34-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:34):**  can do this within weeks, weeks, not the centuries or millennia it'll take to drop CO2 levels.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:41):**  We can do it in weeks simply by not mowing our lawns, simply by giving protective soil  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:48):**  cover through ecological grassland management. So it's our most powerful agency. And as I  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:26:55):**  said before, we've got 5 billion hectares of manmade desert and wasteland on this planet  
**[0:27:01-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:01):**  that was all vegetated 8,000 years ago, the Sahara, Australia, you name it, it was all  
**[0:27:08-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:08):**  Middle East, it was all vegetated. And if we can restore even 20% of that back to protective  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:14):**  cooler surfaces, we can turn down the greenhouse effect naturally, safely in time, we can cool  
**[0:27:21-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:21):**  this planet.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:22):**  So it's not just about managing the grasslands that we currently have, but reversing a ridification  
**[0:27:29-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:29):**  across huge portions of the land. And I'm interested when you mention places like the  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:33):**  Sahara, the idea that we can actually reverse desertification there through the imposition  
**[0:27:39-0:27:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:39):**  of livestock and the restoring of ecological cycles.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:43):**  And yeah, look, it's all there in our face. If we read history, the Romans got all their  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:48):**  wild animals from the Colosseum from Libya. If you go to Libya now, what have we got desert?  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:54):**  Obviously, 2000 years ago, it was Savannah grassland, because they wouldn't have been  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:27:59):**  able to get the lions and the wild animals for the Colosseum. So in 2000 years, we've  
**[0:28:05-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:05):**  desertified Libya. And basically, we have the capacity through grassland management,  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:11):**  permanent management to regenerate that, but in that process, naturally, safely cooling  
**[0:28:17-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:17):**  the planet in time.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:19):**  I wonder if you could just spend a moment, a minute or two talking about, because your  
**[0:28:24-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:24):**  work isn't just theoretical, is it? You're actually involved in the practical application  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:28):**  of this, particularly in India at the moment. And I wonder if you just talk through, you  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:32):**  know, what you're doing in India, and what you're finding there.  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:34):**  Well, look, exactly that. I mean, because we're running out of time, we have 10 years  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:39):**  or less to make the effective change. We need to make change at scale, practically grassroots  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:46):**  on the ground. In India, it's basically now switched the whole nation, but starting from  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:52):**  Andhra Pradesh, natural farming, zero budget, natural farming strategies, thousands of,  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:28:58):**  well, actually millions of farmers going into natural farming. And instead of having one  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:04):**  crop and then having green cover for a third of the time, and two thirds of the time that  
**[0:29:10-0:29:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:10):**  soil was red, dry baking, natural farming is a label to extend green cover 365 days  
**[0:29:18-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:18):**  of the year. And so it's giving you now three crops, higher yield, higher water retention,  
**[0:29:24-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:24):**  but also having an enormous effect in dropping that hot reradiated surface 66% of the time.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:33):**  So it's a matter of, yeah, like the area times the time. And basically, it's as simple as  
**[0:29:39-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:39):**  yet changing a cropping system, changing a grazing system, we can re-green degraded land  
**[0:29:46-0:29:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:46):**  through right agroecology practices within a matter of months. And if we can do that  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:51):**  at scale, as we're doing in India, then we can turn what was otherwise in India's term,  
**[0:29:57-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:29:57):**  you know, 70% red, 30% green, we can make it 90% green, and fundamentally change it.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:04):**  We've got over 1 million women farmers in Andhra Pradesh doing this natural farming  
**[0:30:11-0:30:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:11):**  and benefiting enormously socially, ecologically, economically, from that natural farming change.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:18):**  It's fascinating, and it's really exciting to hear about the work that you're doing there.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:22):**  And of course, that chimes with people, you know, who are familiar with the work of Alan  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:25):**  Savory and Savory Institute. Now, Caroline, coming back to you, regenerative agriculture  
**[0:30:30-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:30):**  requires a very different approach, the type of farming, you know, that we're talking about,  
**[0:30:35-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:35):**  where livestock are integrated, where there are rotations, you know, sort of put back  
**[0:30:39-0:30:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:39):**  in place. And of course, Regen prioritizes biological function and values the complexity  
**[0:30:45-0:30:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:45):**  and systems. And I wonder how farmers and others working in food systems can begin to  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:50):**  adopt this mindset, which for many will be very, very different to the approach that  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:55):**  they've been taught in agricultural college or just, you know, growing up on a farm, because  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:30:59):**  it's very different to perhaps what their parents and grandparents have done.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:02):**  Yeah, absolutely. And of course, you can just copy some of the techniques and the practices  
**[0:31:07-0:31:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:07):**  and that'll get you so far. But if we really, really want to benefit from the kind of whole  
**[0:31:12-0:31:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:12):**  system function that we're talking about here, we need to start to learn how to think like  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:16):**  an ecosystem. And in holistic management, we think of that as holistic thinking, but  
**[0:31:20-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:20):**  you could call it systems thinking is that nonlinear thinking where one plus one doesn't  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:27):**  equal two. And we have to understand how to work with that because living systems are  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:32):**  complex, and not complicated. So once you take a piece out, once a species goes missing,  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:39):**  it changes and accommodates and it's changed forever. So we need a whole different way  
**[0:31:43-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:43):**  of understanding how to work with those systems. Because ultimately, what we're trying to do  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:48):**  is mimic those ecological processes in that system, because those are the most resilient  
**[0:31:54-0:31:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:54):**  systems in the world, they are growing the most primary production from rainfall and  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:31:59):**  sunshine. So as a farming system, that's a pretty good way to go, isn't it? So what we've  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:03):**  got to try and do is understand how to benefit from that whole system function instead of  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:08):**  simplifying it, reducing it, separating it, studying it, and then you know, just thinking  
**[0:32:12-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:12):**  that we can adopt the practices. So what we tend to do is we try and teach that kind of  
**[0:32:19-0:32:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:19):**  that way of thinking, which usually involves a couple of days of intensive training, and  
**[0:32:24-0:32:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:24):**  using lots of different examples to illustrate that. So one way of sort of trying to illustrate  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:29):**  why one plus one might equal four in the case of a healthy ecosystem is examples like this,  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:36):**  there's a lovely story I heard, I can't remember where it came from now. But we're basically  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:40):**  the vineyard was using taking that linear thought process that those plants around the  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:46):**  bottom of the vines are going to be sucking up water, therefore, we must kill those to  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:50):**  allow more water to be given to the vines. Whereas in actual fact, when you under sow  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:32:55):**  the under sowed it with a diverse swathe of flowers and herbs, and actually they ended  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:00):**  up reducing their water usage by about 40% or something, you know, there's lots of different  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:05):**  versions of that same story, it doesn't make any linear sense that more plants sucking  
**[0:33:09-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:09):**  up water would lead to less water use. But in actual fact, what's happening in the soil  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:13):**  is that well, across the whole surface is that it's, yeah, the transpiration is cooling  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:18):**  it so you get less evaporation, the water is being able to be penetrated into the soil  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:22):**  surface, the aggregate aggregates have developed so that they're holding on to the water and  
**[0:33:26-0:33:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:26):**  not evaporating. The mycorrhizal fungi is allowing the plants to explore more of the  
**[0:33:31-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:31):**  water, including the vines, because they're talking to each other, the whole system is  
**[0:33:34-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:34):**  starting to need less water and be more resilient. So that's one way of sort of thinking about  
**[0:33:39-0:33:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:39):**  how this nonlinear way of working comes about. So we kind of call this redefining productivity.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:47):**  And if you think of like a dairy system, you might, if you're thinking purely about productivity  
**[0:33:52-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:52):**  through the lens of how much grass can I grow in every grazing, then you might think of  
**[0:33:56-0:34:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:33:56):**  okay, well, let's go for ryegrass and clover in a lab or in a field trial that clearly  
**[0:34:02-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:02):**  is the most productive, but then you've got to reseed it so many, you know, every few  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:07):**  years, and you've got a lot of bare soil because it's got a very low carbon to nitrogen ratios,  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:11):**  it's hard to keep as much on the soil surface quite gappy, which means you've got bare soil  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:16):**  that's evaporating. So in if every other year and you're going into drought and losing productivity  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:23):**  through the main part of the season, then over a 10 year period, is it really that productive?  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:28):**  Because ultimately, we've you know, we've we've collapsed ourself and the use of nitrogen,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:32):**  that whole system is designed around the starting point of the plants, not bred for plants that  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:38):**  don't give exudates and talk to the soil microbes, because that's inefficient. Therefore, that  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:43):**  plant grows really well in the presence of nitrogen, but not so well under, you know,  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:47):**  no fertility circumstances, that then that we've bred cows that then do well on that  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:53):**  type of plant, they have very high digestible plants and lots of, you know, protein and  
**[0:34:57-0:35:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:34:57):**  energy. And then ultimately, our whole infrastructure staffing contracts that we take up with our  
**[0:35:02-0:35:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:02):**  milk companies and everything is designed for that system. So we can't just change one  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:06):**  little piece of that. We've got to, we can't just do a paddock grazing trial and assume  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:10):**  that we're going to see the result being great, that's just going to fail. We need the whole  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:15):**  system to adapt and change. So that's what I mean when I talk about whole system function.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:20):**  So the farmers need to understand that. But also the scientists, people like Walter are  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:24):**  brilliant because they could they truly understand this whole system function, whereas a lot  
**[0:35:28-0:35:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:28):**  of reductionist science is missing that, leading us to sort of chasing net zero as a kind of  
**[0:35:34-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:34):**  the main thing that we're doing at the moment. And then the policymakers and the companies  
**[0:35:40-0:35:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:40):**  setting up the contracts, everybody needs to understand that better.  
**[0:35:43-0:35:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:43):**  Fantastic. Thanks so much. There's one final question that I have that I want to put to  
**[0:35:47-0:35:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:47):**  you Walter, if that's okay, before we go into the audience questions, which are some really  
**[0:35:51-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:51):**  interesting stuff coming through. And the question is about ruminants. And of course,  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:35:56):**  ruminant producers have been heavily criticised because cattle, sheep and goats produce methane.  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:01):**  And so what I want to ask you is about how important ruminant methane is in the big scheme  
**[0:36:07-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:07):**  of things, so far as you're concerned.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:09):**  Okay, well look, it's very much what Caroline was saying, instead of having a linear system,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:14):**  a reductionist look and say, hey, yes, cattle, all herbivores, all anaerobic digesters produce  
**[0:36:21-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:21):**  methane, us included, instead of saying here's a bad thing, methane, we've got to look at  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:27):**  it as a cycle, we've got to look at what happens in nature. And if we do that with methane,  
**[0:36:32-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:32):**  it's just very, very simple, absolute, because methane naturally for the last 100 million  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:38):**  years has been at a very, very low 700 parts per billion or thereabouts. And we've had  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:44):**  more cattle and we've had more herbivores and more wetlands producing methane. So yes,  
**[0:36:51-0:36:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:51):**  we've been producing vast quantities of methane naturally, but also nature has got a way of  
**[0:36:57-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:36:57):**  removing methane, otherwise it couldn't have been 700 parts per billion. And of course,  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:03):**  that process is very simple. We've known about it in science, totally verified, but we're  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:08):**  ignoring it in the political debate totally. And of course, that's hydroxyl ion formation  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:14):**  when water vapour transpired largely from pastures is then photo oxidised by sunlight  
**[0:37:21-0:37:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:21):**  and forms hydroxyl ions and then hydrogen, which forms bicarbonate ions, complex process,  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:27):**  but basically producing hydroxyl ions, which is effectively the laundry of the atmosphere.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:33):**  And it's that hydroxyl ion production which cleans up the air, removes particulate carbon,  
**[0:37:40-0:37:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:40):**  CO2, carbon monoxide, keeps the air clean. Now, very simple thing. A cow, for example,  
**[0:37:48-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:48):**  grazing a pasture will sustain about five acres, two hectares of pastures, depending  
**[0:37:54-0:38:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:37:54):**  on the grassland. That cow will produce 100 times or more the hydroxyl ion methane cleanup  
**[0:38:03-0:38:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:03):**  capacity compared to its own methane emissions. So this little cow, it's an ecosystem service  
**[0:38:11-0:38:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:11):**  that's enormously benefiting the planet, removing methane naturally. So instead of trying to  
**[0:38:18-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:18):**  tax the methane emissions from us, we should be crediting the ecosystem services, the photo  
**[0:38:24-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:24):**  oxidation value of that cow. This becomes extremely important, an existential importance,  
**[0:38:31-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:31):**  right? Because we've got some 15,000 billion tonnes of carbon as methane hydrates and entendres  
**[0:38:40-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:40):**  sitting in the Arctic regions of this planet. And if that releases in a pulse and it is  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:46):**  slowly releasing, hopefully not as a pulse, then that can become an extinction event,  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:52):**  that vast flux of methane. The only thing that is actually stopping that danger and  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:38:58):**  the only thing that can avoid that is enough hydroxyl ion formation from healthy grasslands  
**[0:39:05-0:39:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:05):**  maintained by healthy herbivores, which are producing some methane, one in 100. Okay,  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:11):**  so we've got this stupid bullshit, excuse the pun, basically, you know, that where we're  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:17):**  trying to penalise herbivores because they're producing methane, ignoring the 100 fold benefit  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:24):**  that they are generating and cleaning up not just methane, but CO2 and carbon monoxide,  
**[0:39:31-0:39:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:31):**  carbon particulate, polyaromatic carbons from the atmosphere. So we've just got to get real  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:36):**  and look at it a whole, as Caroline says, a whole systemic analysis rather than taking  
**[0:39:41-0:39:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:41):**  a reductionist single linear factor and going la la on that.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:46):**  Fantastic. Thanks so much, Walter. That was actually sort of addressing a question that  
**[0:39:51-0:39:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:51):**  came in prior to the webinar from Bill. So thanks very much for that, Bill, and making  
**[0:39:54-0:39:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:54):**  sure that we covered that particular issue. Jim, you've asked a question about sharing  
**[0:39:59-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:39:59):**  and linking to this webinar when it's available on YouTube. Please do. The more shares, you  
**[0:40:04-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:04):**  know, this webinar gets, the more the messages that are contained within it can be shared  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:09):**  around. We've got a question here. Catherine asks, in the UK, we are in fact predominantly  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:15):**  a wooded biome. We're not one of the great natural grasslands. So for the water cycle  
**[0:40:20-0:40:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:20):**  and the carbon sponge, is it not better to majorly reforest, natively reforest our land  
**[0:40:26-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:26):**  in association with pasture and crops if necessary? Well, look, very, very quickly, I'll let Caroline  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:32):**  do the most of it. But the point is that, no, it doesn't matter if it's grassland or  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:35):**  forest, it doesn't matter if it's a cow or if it's an insect or a bird, it's the same  
**[0:40:40-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:40):**  process. Nature's got diversity. It'll use trees, it'll use grasslands, it'll use wetlands.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:47):**  It's all the same function of basically soils, retaining water, making nutrients available,  
**[0:40:53-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:53):**  growing plants, transpiring and herbivores managing that biosystem. But no, there's  
**[0:40:59-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:40:59):**  no favouritism here, grassland versus forest. It's horses for courses, it's diversity,  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:06):**  it's plurality, it's synergies. And I would say as well, just before passing  
**[0:41:10-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:10):**  over to Caroline, is that this idea that it was mainly covered in native woodland is not  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:15):**  quite right, that there was obviously a lot more woodland than there is today. But it  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:20):**  was actually also a lot more grassland, a lot more savannah type land as well, lots  
**[0:41:25-0:41:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:25):**  of scrub and bushes and grasses, as well as that sort of more heavily, densely wooded  
**[0:41:30-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:30):**  areas. Caroline? Yeah, I completely agree with both of you.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:34):**  And what I would say is, yeah, absolutely, we want diverse range of habitats. But originally,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:39):**  it probably would have been that, yeah, we wouldn't have had the big plain type habitats  
**[0:41:43-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:43):**  with huge, you know, mobs of animals together, but we would have definitely had herbivores  
**[0:41:47-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:47):**  in our woodlands. So it would have probably been more like a savannah, as you say, with  
**[0:41:52-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:52):**  open glades, and woodland. And that's very much what we try and encourage farmers to  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:41:56):**  manage that type of wood pasture again, for all the amazing benefits of, you know, reducing  
**[0:42:01-0:42:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:01):**  evaporation and reducing, you know, improving the infiltration and all of that. But ultimately,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:06):**  we do still even in the woodlands, we do still need to have those things that are digesting  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:11):**  that plant material and improving the cycling of the nutrients. And then in the uplands,  
**[0:42:16-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:16):**  where a lot of, you know, the UK has got a great deal of steep grounds that's not suitable  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:20):**  for any other food production. And those areas where you've got a high rainfall and steep  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:25):**  sides, what's happened over time is you've ended up what would have been a wooded environment  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:28):**  or a savannah type environment, probably quite high up the sides is that the soil has washed  
**[0:42:33-0:42:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:33):**  out, the fertility is washed out through probably a combination of deforestation and killing  
**[0:42:37-0:42:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:37):**  predators and various other things. And now we've got a denuded landscape that doesn't,  
**[0:42:41-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:41):**  you know, we've got some areas that have turned to bog, and that's slowing the flow to some  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:44):**  degree, but that landscape goes rank and it would benefit from properly managed herbivores.  
**[0:42:49-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:49):**  I'm not talking about the set stocking that we currently have, but if properly managed  
**[0:42:53-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:53):**  herbivores in that system would increase and improve the water retention and in there too,  
**[0:42:59-0:43:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:42:59):**  you know, something like two buckets of water per every percent of carbon increasing in  
**[0:43:03-0:43:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:03):**  the soil that we can hold extra up the hill, rather than it flooding down into the bottoms  
**[0:43:08-0:43:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:08):**  with all the nutrients attached and ending up in our homes.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:12):**  And actually, am I right, Caroline, that when we're talking about those Auckland areas,  
**[0:43:15-0:43:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:15):**  perhaps, you know, particularly the lower uplands, that actually the ruminants are part  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:19):**  of that process, but the reintegration of bush and shrub and sort of low level trees,  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:24):**  sort of more agroforestry systems are actually really important in terms of maintaining and  
**[0:43:29-0:43:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:29):**  restoring that cycling of nutrients and water.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:33):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:43:36-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:36):**  There's another question that I'm going to go to.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:37):**  So, the question from Dorrit is, is regeneration without large herbivores possible, as the vegan  
**[0:43:43-0:43:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:43):**  community is telling the public?  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:44):**  She says that she can't see how, but we could do with some solid science to back us up when  
**[0:43:48-0:43:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:48):**  we let the cows out to stand in for the missing wildlife as habitat engineers.  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:52):**  So, Walter, perhaps we can come to you first.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:54):**  Yeah, well, look, very much.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:43:55):**  You know, I don't have the UK specifics in this, but look, it's very, very clear.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:00):**  We need the herbivores as biorecyclists, right?  
**[0:44:04-0:44:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:04):**  It's absolutely critical because if we just let wilderness happen and we'll just get scrubbed,  
**[0:44:09-0:44:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:09):**  we'll get fire fuels, we'll get wildfires, we'll get carbon oxidation, desertification,  
**[0:44:15-0:44:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:15):**  and we turn back to desert wasteland, right?  
**[0:44:19-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:19):**  So, the whole point of herbivores was to avoid those fire catastrophic events and that degradation  
**[0:44:27-0:44:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:27):**  because it's the herbivores that are taking that excess biomass, often old biomass, and  
**[0:44:32-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:32):**  turning it back into bio fertilizer through their dung and also soil carbon.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:38):**  So, it's this biological cycling function of the herbivores that is critical.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:43):**  Obviously, you don't just have to look at cattle here.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:45):**  I mean, termites are herbivores, insects in the canopies are herbivores.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:50):**  The biomass of these herbivores are vastly higher than just the cattle.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:44:55):**  So yes, this bio cycling is absolutely critical because if not, we end up with the default  
**[0:45:02-0:45:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:02):**  wildfires and then we end up with desertification.  
**[0:45:05-0:45:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:05):**  Caroline, I don't want to sit here and judge people for their choices, for the choices  
**[0:45:11-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:11):**  on the food that they choose to eat.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:13):**  The world has got plenty of space for vegans and vegetarians, the same as it has meat eaters.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:18):**  But I guess the core of the question is, if everybody was a vegan, would we be able to  
**[0:45:23-0:45:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:23):**  do what we need to do?  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:25):**  How critical are livestock to the processes that we're talking about?  
**[0:45:28-0:45:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:28):**  So, I think in the non-brital environments of Europe and the UK, they're probably, you  
**[0:45:34-0:45:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:34):**  could probably, you know, on a very small scale, particularly, you could use compost  
**[0:45:38-0:45:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:38):**  as a proxy for grazing animals as a way of sort of micromanaging that process with our  
**[0:45:43-0:45:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:43):**  tools physically knocking vegetation down, strimming it, using compost, that sort of  
**[0:45:48-0:45:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:48):**  thing.  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:49):**  It could be done on a small scale if people choose to do that as part of the belief system.  
**[0:45:53-0:45:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:53):**  That's totally fine.  
**[0:45:55-0:45:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:55):**  But ultimately, you've got to realise that we're not really separating that out.  
**[0:45:58-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:45:58):**  It's not like there's no living things in that system.  
**[0:46:01-0:46:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:01):**  Ultimately, compost is made up of just very small animals instead of big animals.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:04):**  So, it's all death and decay and eating each other.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:07):**  So, we're under a little bit of an illusion if we think we can actually have a truly vegan  
**[0:46:11-0:46:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:11):**  vegetable, you know, ultimately that if it's being fed naturally through those composted  
**[0:46:16-0:46:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:16):**  systems and it's eating dead decaying material, it's just a slightly different size, doesn't  
**[0:46:21-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:21):**  have a character, perhaps.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:23):**  So, you know, really, it's just for me, there is no way of segregating that.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:27):**  So, yes, it could be done, particularly in the moisture areas of the world.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:30):**  But then when you start to get into those macro landscapes of the uplands of the UK,  
**[0:46:35-0:46:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:35):**  even where we're talking about thousands of acres of, you know, very low-grid grassland  
**[0:46:40-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:40):**  in steep areas that are rocky that can't produce food in any other way, what would, you know,  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:45):**  okay, and again, I would totally dispute the argument that removing the animals is better  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:49):**  for the ecology.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:50):**  In my experience, it's not actually, and actually that whole process of cycling the nutrients  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:55):**  is regenerating the energy system, which means that we've got more photosynthesis and primary  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:46:58):**  production which leads to more wildlife.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:01):**  You know, I see that as a plus plus, but ultimately we can maintain that kind of healthy hydrology  
**[0:47:07-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:07):**  and mineral cycling.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:08):**  And it'd be very difficult to do that in any other way.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:11):**  You know, planting trees, yes, but then, you know, trees alone without a herbivore, trampling  
**[0:47:16-0:47:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:16):**  and manuring and proving that soil fertility are not going to do as well as, you know,  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:21):**  a whole system that includes the right type of browsing and grazing animals.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:26):**  And as Walter says, that's tiny, you know, birds, herbivory, right through to insects,  
**[0:47:31-0:47:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:31):**  right through to organisms in the soil, right through to the animals that would, you know,  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:35):**  the deer, the, you know, what the proxies for what would have been wild at the time.  
**[0:47:39-0:47:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:39):**  So I just think that, you know, we've got a solar power, I love Walter's way of describing  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:44):**  these solar powered, self-replicating biodigesters that we can eat and taste great and are really  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:49):**  nutritious that can go up and if we're properly managing them, can do great, you know, great  
**[0:47:53-0:47:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:53):**  stuff on these upland, large environments in these desert regions of grassland that  
**[0:47:57-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:57):**  we're talking about.  
**[0:47:58-0:48:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:47:58):**  Why wouldn't we do that?  
**[0:48:00-0:48:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:00):**  And of course, you know, the thing that we haven't touched on is the economics of this  
**[0:48:04-0:48:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:04):**  as well.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:05):**  And when we're talking about managing landscape, this needs to be paid for, you know, in one  
**[0:48:09-0:48:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:09):**  way or another.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:10):**  The best way is to integrate this functioning of nature, this managing of that landscape  
**[0:48:14-0:48:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:14):**  so that it cycles water and sunlight and nutrients in the way that it needs to, is to have an  
**[0:48:19-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:19):**  active farming community so that farmers are able to earn money for the food that they're  
**[0:48:23-0:48:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:23):**  producing, as well as managing the landscape that they do.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:26):**  I've got one final question that I want to put to you both, if I may, just briefly.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:32):**  And it's that, you know, I've said in the past that you can win a war with guns and  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:38):**  tanks, but a functioning food system is essential to maintaining the peace once you've won that  
**[0:48:44-0:48:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:44):**  war.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:45):**  And it's essential to maintaining peace so that you avoid that war in the first place.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:49):**  Now, just in your own view, how critical is soil and hydrological function to maintaining  
**[0:48:55-0:48:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:55):**  peace?  
**[0:48:56-0:48:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:56):**  Caroline, can I come to you first?  
**[0:48:57-0:49:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:48:57):**  It's more obvious how important that is in the drylands and water could speak to that.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:01):**  But even in the UK, you know, you can just start to think about, I suppose, some of what's  
**[0:49:05-0:49:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:05):**  happening at the moment has made me think a lot about what would happen if, you know,  
**[0:49:09-0:49:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:09):**  if we suddenly got cut off from fertilizer, if the grain stopped being available, all  
**[0:49:13-0:49:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:13):**  of those things, the what ifs that we do think about in regenerative and, you know, as water  
**[0:49:17-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:17):**  says we're sort of seven meals away from anarchy, even in what we've considered to be a country  
**[0:49:22-0:49:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:22):**  that could never happen.  
**[0:49:24-0:49:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:24):**  How important now do we realise that having our own, you know, energy resilience and food  
**[0:49:29-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:29):**  resilience and food production resilience, and it's got to be so much more than just  
**[0:49:33-0:49:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:33):**  calories or protein, we've got to think of in truly sustainable nutrient dense foods  
**[0:49:39-0:49:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:39):**  available throughout the season, in ways that can be stored and utilised effectively.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:45):**  So just relying on calories from cropping systems that might be highly productive on  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:50):**  a, you know, comparing it with another system, but then it might be subject to drought and  
**[0:49:55-0:50:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:49:55):**  fail and or we it doesn't work if we can't get a part for a combine or whatever else  
**[0:50:00-0:50:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:00):**  is a very vulnerable situation to be in.  
**[0:50:02-0:50:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:02):**  So for me, you know, if the food system breaks down, it's not going to take long for people  
**[0:50:07-0:50:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:07):**  to start to break down to society to start to break down.  
**[0:50:10-0:50:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:10):**  So for me, it's really made if it wasn't already obvious to me, this year has really highlighted  
**[0:50:15-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:15):**  the importance of this on a farm by farm basis.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:17):**  We need resilient food systems for our local communities.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:20):**  Thank you, Caroline.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:21):**  Walter, you get the last word.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:22):**  Well, look, yeah, I fully agree.  
**[0:50:24-0:50:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:24):**  I mean, that point seven missed meals between social stability and chaos.  
**[0:50:29-0:50:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:29):**  And therefore, it's really imperative, isn't it, that we've got to look at resilience,  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:34):**  we've got to look autonomy, we've got to look at localised cycles.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:38):**  And all of that is building around soil health.  
**[0:50:41-0:50:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:41):**  It's really the soil that gives us resilience, autonomy, cycling, it's optimising those cycles.  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:48):**  But it's also empowering societies, because that's where your employment, it's your eco  
**[0:50:53-0:50:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:53):**  enterprises.  
**[0:50:54-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:50:54):**  You know, this is how you build resilient, healthy, diverse societies as well.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:00):**  And really, yeah, I think the building the soil, the sponge, the hydrology, those food  
**[0:51:05-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:05):**  systems is critical.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:07):**  But of course, don't leave it to me.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:09):**  That's what Jared Diamond did the thing.  
**[0:51:11-0:51:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:11):**  He said, look, here's civilisations, over 20 civilisations across the history have collapsed.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:17):**  We see them in the dust of archaeology, because they've destroyed their soils.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:22):**  And the only civilisations that have survived are civilisations that have sustained, regenerate  
**[0:51:28-0:51:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:28):**  and enhance their soils.  
**[0:51:30-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:30):**  President Roosevelt made the statement a nation that destroys its soil, destroys itself.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:36):**  And we're very close to that imperative.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:39):**  But we're not going to escape history, if we don't actually take heed of those warnings.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:44):**  Thank you very much to both of you on the panel.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:48):**  Thanks very much to the audience for the questions and for being here and taking part.  
**[0:51:51-0:51:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:51):**  I mean, what a fantastic opportunity it's been to listen to, you know, the wisdom of  
**[0:51:57-0:52:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:51:57):**  both Walter and Caroline and to hear that conversation.  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:52:00):**  So that's it.  
**[0:52:02-0:52:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:52:02):**  Thank you very much indeed, everybody, for joining us.  
**[0:52:04-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:52:04):**  Thank you to Walter Jayner from Regenerate Earth and Caroline Grindrod from Roots of  
**[0:52:10-0:52:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:52:10):**  Nature.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:52:11):**  And hopefully, we'll see you next time.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Restoring-water--with-Walter-Jehne--Caroline-Grindrod-e1o6rqt#t=0:52:12):**  Thank you.

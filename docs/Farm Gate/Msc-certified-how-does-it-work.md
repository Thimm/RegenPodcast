**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. The Marine Stewardship Council is an international  NGO working to protect oceans and safeguard seafood supplies for the future. They're  also behind the blue MSC eco-label, which can be found on a wide range of seafood products  
**[0:00:22-0:00:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:00:22):**  in supermarkets and other retailers in the UK, USA, the European Union and Asia Pacific.  George Clark is the MSC's programme director for the UK and Ireland and he joins me today.  Hello, George.  
**[0:00:34-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:00:34):**  Hi there, Finnlow.  So George, the makers of the Netflix film Seaspiracy concluded that sustainable seafood  is a myth. Are they right?  
**[0:00:42-0:00:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:00:42):**  No, sustainable seafood isn't a myth. The MSC has got a globally recognised standard  for sustainable seafood and it's important to remember that there's an enormous amount  of effort that goes into ensuring that sustainable seafood is possible for consumers and that  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:00:58):**  takes the efforts of fishermen, the complete supply chain that brings it from boat to plate  and then the restaurants, retailers and fish and chip shops at least in the UK that then  serve it. I guess it's important to then define what sustainable fishing is and the simple  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:01:13):**  explanation is that you're taking fewer fish from the sea than are needed to repopulate  the next generation of that species. So it's like having Â£100 in the bank and just using  the interest that you're earning rather than dipping into the capital and that way you  
**[0:01:28-0:01:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:01:28):**  ensure that you're retaining the capital for this generation, for future generations as  well. As soon as you start dipping into that capital, your interest potential diminishes  and the stock size then drops.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:01:40):**  I like that analogy. Are there sort of key principles that guide the work of the MSC?  Yeah, so we operate a standard we call it and that standard is what fisheries are assessed  against in order to gain their MSC certification and it's got three pillars or three principles  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:01:55):**  if you like and the first of which is around management of stocks. The second and the third  are around ecosystem impacts and environmental aspects, that's principle two and then good  management practices, that's the rules and regulations that fisheries have in principle  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:02:14):**  three.  So if you could just talk me through those first two principles in particular in a bit  more detail. How is it that you actually measure the sustainability of an individual species  
**[0:02:23-0:02:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:02:23):**  in an individual fishery?  So I mean the first principle as I say is very much based upon stocks and so fishing  must be at a level that ensures it can continue indefinitely and the fish population remain  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:02:35):**  productive and healthy and that applies to the entire stock that's under assessment and  the combined impact of all fishery activities taking place. So effectively the fishery and  we define that as a group of vessels or boats operating in a specific area and catching  
**[0:02:52-0:02:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:02:52):**  a particular type of fish or species in a particular way whether it be nets or lines,  they need to be operating in such a manner that doesn't lead to overfishing or depletion  of that stock and so what we're trying to avoid is that scenario where stocks become  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:03:08):**  depleted and overfishing occurs. It needs to either be operating in a way that's improving  the stock to take it out of depletion or operating in a way that's not causing depletion and  maintaining a healthy stock.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:03:21):**  So you said there that it's the whole fishery that you're looking at and the multiplicity  of species within that. If you had a situation where you know one species was doing really  badly but the others were doing fairly well, I don't know if that would happen, would that  
**[0:03:35-0:03:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:03:35):**  mean that that whole fishery was then ineligible for MSC status?  Yes, I mean the important thing to remember about fishing and sustainability is that you  can't just look at one individual marker or measure, you have to look at fisheries as  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:03:49):**  a whole. So if you're for instance catching European hake with gillnets as they do down  in Newland in Cornwall, you're of course having other impacts. You're not just catching hake  but you're catching other species. Maybe that's pollock for instance in that area. So an MSC  
**[0:04:04-0:04:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:04:04):**  certification, if you've selected a hake as your primary species to be certified, will  not just look at the impact of the fishing on that hake stock but it will also take into  account bycatch of other species or the secondary catch of other species. In the case of the  
**[0:04:21-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:04:21):**  hake fishery in Cornwall, it could be things like pollock and so the impact of fishing  for hake on the pollock stock will also be taken into account. If the reference points  we call them are really low for pollock and it appears that the stock might be under threat  
**[0:04:35-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:04:35):**  through continued fishing of hake but also secondary bycatch of pollock, then it could  be that that certificate is drawn into question. As it is, that hake certificate is currently  certified and operating sustainably and so they are managing the impacts of both hake  
**[0:04:50-0:04:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:04:50):**  and pollock as well.  So the second principle that you talked about was around the environmental impact of the  fishery more broadly. Just talk me through that a little bit if you would.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:04:59):**  Obviously, when you go out to fish, there's unintended consequences or there's impacts  beyond just that species that you're trying to catch. That can be impacts on non-primary  species or secondary species we call them. If you're going out to catch cod, you might  
**[0:05:15-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:05:15):**  also be catching haddocks or clays or something like that. It's important to, when we're certifying  fisheries as the independent auditors will do, not just look at the primary species that  you're trying to catch and get certified. You need to look at everything else.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:05:30):**  There's, I guess, commercially valuable secondary species that would be taken into account in  that principle too, that environmental impact. But then there's also other types of marine  species, marine mammals and other threatened or protected species that would need to be  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:05:46):**  considered too. You'd also need to take into account habitat impacts as well. Whether or  not the fishing gear interacts with the sea floor, whether there's a sea bird bycatch  as well happening on the ocean surface. So all those aspects are considered and reviewed  
**[0:06:03-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:06:03):**  when an MSC certificate is audited for.  Toby  It's important to note that MSC is voluntary and it's open to all types of fishing, bar  
**[0:06:35-0:06:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:06:35):**  a few extremely destructive and in most cases illegal practices. So things like bottom trawling,  things like dredging are permissible to enter MSC certification and MSC assessment. It is  the case that many fisheries have gained MSC certification that do operate those types  
**[0:06:53-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:06:53):**  of gears. But it's important to assess the impacts of those gears within their own circumstances  or within their own rights, much like large scale farming, large scale fishing needs to  be well managed to ensure it's sustainable into the long term. So although an image of  
**[0:07:10-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:07:10):**  a dredge dragging across the sea floor may appear at first glance to be highly destructive  and for want of a kind of better simplification bad in quotation marks.  Toby I mean, sort of a mining activity effectively.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:07:23):**  Toby Well, I guess I most commonly equate it to  on land farming. So if you see a plough being dragged through a field, you know that field  you know centuries ago may well have been lush woodland but us humans have a tendency  
**[0:07:37-0:07:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:07:37):**  to make the most of the land or the seas that are available to us to ensure that we can  grow productive and well kept food systems. In the case of dredging, for example, MSC  certified dredge scallop fisheries, for instance, will be putting in place a lot of measures  
**[0:07:53-0:07:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:07:53):**  to ensure that the dredging that they're conducting is not damaging vulnerable marine habitats  or protected habitats and species that are known to be in the areas with which they are  harvesting and dredging. And in a lot of cases, actually, the fishermen, the certificates  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:08:09):**  are creating new scientific reference points to enable them to operate more sustainably.  And so I think when you're looking at fishing and comparing good and bad, it's not always  as clear cut as that.  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:08:21):**  I'm just wondering, George, if you could give me a couple of examples of fisheries that  in your view have been transformed from something less than ideal to something, you know, genuinely  on the road to sustainability by MSC certification.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:08:34):**  Well, I think there are success stories that exist. So, you know, about 30 years ago, hay  stocks in Namibia were extremely overfished. But thanks to the adoption of sustainable  practices, their stocks have now doubled in size. And that fishery gained MSC certification  
**[0:08:51-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:08:51):**  within the last year. Closer to home in Cornwall, like with that hake example I gave earlier,  the hay stock in Cornwall wasn't in a particularly great state in the 1990s. Stringent management  processes and restrictions were put in place. And it's thanks to the efforts of fishermen  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:09:07):**  and management agencies that that hake stock's now increased and become stable and now certified.  And then fisheries can actually benefit from having that status. The hake fishery in Cornwall  has developed a brand new domestic market where it was previously or mostly exported  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:09:24):**  to Spain. And as a result of that increased popularity, prices have improved. And that's  a brilliant outcome for coastal communities in the UK that have been struggling for many  years.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:09:35):**  So, just going back to Sea Spiracy for a moment, which is kind of where we came in with this  idea of whether fisheries can even be sustainable. And clearly, you know, as you've set out there,  they can be. What did you think of the film in general?  
**[0:09:48-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:09:48):**  Well, as a lover of documentaries, I felt that I believe in the cause that the film  taps into. And of course, there's many painful and disturbing issues that need to and are  in fact being addressed by many good non-governmental organisations. But I don't agree with the  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:10:04):**  method and the overall message, which was obviously to not eat fish at all, as a kind  of omnivore that reconciled fish consumption at a young age. Catching my first mackerel,  I don't believe that shocking and forcing people into changing their food choices by  
**[0:10:20-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:10:20):**  cherry picking all the worst examples of a particular food system is the way to go about  things.  It's highlighted the crisis in our oceans caused by overfishing. And it's certainly  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:10:30):**  got the attention of the general public and pushed it up the news agenda, which I think  is a good thing. But the conclusion that sustainable seafood doesn't exist, I just don't think  it's either true or the right message to be sending for a planet that is expected to have  
**[0:10:49-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:10:49):**  a population increase to 10 billion people by 2050. We need to harness our natural resources  and utilise them responsibly. And I think that simply disconnecting or abandoning a  food system altogether is not the right approach, particularly fish and fishing.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:11:06):**  You mentioned there as well, I mean, one of the key themes of the film was overfishing.  You referred to it there as a big problem. How much of seafood would you say was sustainable,  is monitored and measured as being sustainable?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:11:21):**  The MSC has an ambition to have 30% of the world's seafood catch engaged in our programme  by 2030. We're now around 16%. So it's a long way to go for us.  So does that mean that the rest of it is overfished to one extent or another?  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:11:39):**  No, no, it doesn't. It just means that only 16% of the landings, the tonnage, has actually  gone through the MSC process, which is voluntary. Fisheries choose to go through that process  and it's not a legal requirement in many, many cases. And of course, MSC assessments  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:11:56):**  take into account much more than just the stock status and the overfishing status. It's  the wider environmental impacts and management. So the UN projects that around 34% of fish  stocks are overfished.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:12:09):**  Which in itself is really significant, but it's by no means 100%. If we're talking about  a third of stocks being overfished, that's clearly a big problem, but it's not as big  as was being painted by seaspiracy.  
**[0:12:21-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:12:21):**  No, exactly. And I think that there's conflation of statistics that's leading to a much more  alarmist presentation of the facts. As I say, the UN says 34% is overfished. The vast majority  of the remainder is then either sustainably managed, which ultimately means underfished  
**[0:12:40-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:12:40):**  or fished to the maximum sustainable yield that a fishery can cope with. And MSC fisheries  would exist in that remaining 66%.  One of the themes in seaspiracy, I mean, they went out and they interviewed a whole range  
**[0:12:53-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:12:53):**  of different people, different organisations. And one of the key themes was coming back  to the MSC saying, we've tried to talk to the MSC and they won't talk to us. Turning  up at your door and getting turned away. I wonder why it was that the Marine Stewardship  
**[0:13:08-0:13:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:13:08):**  Council didn't want to be interviewed.  I personally equate this to the same choices that consumers have to eat or not eat fish.  And everyone has a choice in this life. And I think in this instance, the MSC felt that  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:13:22):**  we had a choice to participate or not. And when we were approached, we did our research  and we felt that owing to previous productions, the viewpoints and the ambition or kind of  goals of the MSC wouldn't really be reflected in a balanced or fair way. You know, the conclusion  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:13:42):**  of sustainable fishing not existing wasn't just drawn out in seaspiracy for the first  time that was referenced in past films that the same production team had worked on as  well. Cowspiracy, which I think came out in 2014.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:13:56):**  And I think a lot of regular listeners will be familiar with Cowspiracy. And again, while  some of the broad themes are accurate, again, there was a real challenge around some of  the basic facts and the basic science in the film.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:14:07):**  Absolutely. So I think, you know, as I said, you know, the cause is righteous. You know,  I believe in the cause. But the use of the cause to pursue a particular method or outcome,  i.e. to encourage everyone to not eat fish at all, you can kind of cut through and see  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:14:23):**  through quite quickly if you know a thing or two about fishing or indeed if you're a  kind of interested consumer as well. So I think that having then decided not to participate,  having then viewed the film and seeing the reaction from those that did, I felt we made  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:14:39):**  the right choice because you had individual scientists or NGO groups that are well respected,  doing great work, not really given the fair platform that you feel should or could be  given. We're ultimately used to create a bit of distrust within the good in that space,  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:14:56):**  which I think is a kind of method to erode trust altogether in fish.  I'm just wondering if we can get into some of the nuts and bolts around certification.  I'm just thinking, you know, we spoke earlier about the principles of MSC certification.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:15:09):**  So if I was a fisher, how would I go about becoming certified?  The best thing to do first is to contact MSC directly. We have outreach teams that are  there to support any fishery or any supply chain company that wants to look into either  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:15:24):**  of the certifications that MSC offers. As I said, the certification process is separate  to the MSC. It's conducted by independent auditors or certification and assessment bodies,  CABs for short. And so we would kind of provide guidance on how to approach a CAB and then  
**[0:15:40-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:15:40):**  the fishermen would ultimately contact the CAB to arrange an audit. And there's all sorts  of guidance materials and standards documents that we'd be able to provide as well.  And I guess that comes into what a sustainability management plan actually looks like in the  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:15:56):**  first place. And that's the third principle that you mentioned, the third pillar around  MSC certification. So I wonder how much detail you'd expect that sustainable management plan  to go into.  
**[0:16:07-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:16:07):**  Yes, I mean, it's really dependent on circumstance. So if it was a small, simplified operation,  because of course, fisheries operate in all types of shape and size, then the management  plans and processes that are needed might be very different to a very large scale multinational  
**[0:16:26-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:16:26):**  certificate that also exists. But it's split down really into two sections, the management  aspect. So first is governance and policy. So the auditors will be looking for effective  legal or customary frameworks that recognise rights of people dependent on fishing for  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:16:46):**  food and livelihoods, effective consultation processes being in place around the operation  of the fishery, and then long term objectives being set. And then the second kind of general  area around management is around management systems. So the fishery must have specific  
**[0:17:03-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:17:03):**  objectives for achieving principle one and two. So that's the stocks and then the environmental  impacts. And then they must have effective decision making processes in place. You know,  if you're an individual fisherman going for certification, which is very uncommon, because  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:17:17):**  you're normally getting cooperatives or collectives of vessels and vessel owners coming together  to put their, you know, group into the system. But regardless of scale or complexity, you'd  still need to have that effective decision making process written down, you'll then need  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:17:32):**  to have compliance and enforcement systems. And if they're not legally provided in a local  setting, then they'll need to be voluntarily provided and abided to the fishery will need  to demonstrate that they're doing that. And then there needs to be an aspect of performance  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:17:46):**  evaluation as well. So you know, for a one person band, you know, a single vessel owner,  that can seem really overbearing and quite complex. And that's why we see very commonly  producer organisations that are really kind of taking ownership of the certificates.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:18:00):**  Now, you mentioned size there. And you know, you talked about it being, you know, an onerous  process if you're just an individual fisherman, which is why, you know, bigger organisations,  producer organisations might take that on. I mean, I'm just wondering, in terms of sustainability,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:18:14):**  the extent to which size matters, is there ever a fishery that's just simply too big?  It's quite difficult to give a kind of particular figure on the average size. We've got I think  around 18% of fisheries that are engaged in the MSC programme being small scale.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:18:29):**  What does that mean? What's small scale?  So small scale MSC has a definition for and it's dependent on the size of the boat, the  type of method that they're using for fishing as well. And so it's generally the kind of  
**[0:18:40-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:18:40):**  smaller size of boats and the smaller volume of fish that's been caught as a result.  So in terms of that, there might be, I don't know, I'm just plucking numbers out of the  air, 20 to 40 fishing boats or vessels that are licensed to that?  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:18:54):**  So I mean, one example in the UK we have is Cornish sardines. So there's around 15 vessels  in that fishery. They use ring nets and they effectively ring around a small shoal of fish,  you know, circle them and catch. And those vessels are generally around 15 metres or  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:19:14):**  under and they generally have about two or three crew. And the fishery is catching around  10,000 tonnes of sardines per season or per year. So that meets our small scale definition.  Now I'm wondering because I mean, obviously one of the reasons that fishers would want  
**[0:19:29-0:19:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:19:29):**  to be part of the MSC process is because having MSC certification adds value or should add  value to the products that are coming out of that fishery. So if those are valuable,  I'm just wondering how easy it would be for a fishery to fake their paperwork and for  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:19:46):**  the blue eco label to end up on an unsustainable fish product.  It wouldn't be easy, ultimately. We're reliant on a system that's audited by independent  bodies that are themselves assessed. And those audits are extremely rigorous. The reports  
**[0:20:01-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:20:01):**  that are produced as a result are anything from 300 to 600 pages. There's a lot of information,  a lot of data that's rigorously assessed and digested. Not forgetting the fact that a lot  of the things that are being checked are legal requirements as well. So there's an added  
**[0:20:16-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:20:16):**  layer of compliance that fisheries are already abiding to. In actual fact, the bulk of the  data that's used to assess stocks and things like that are publicly available. There's  very little rigour room for faking and for cheating the system, if you like. The added  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:20:32):**  protection, I suppose, is that you've got then the traceability assessment that's needed  from the fishery up to the product level. So every company that's actually buying and  selling the MSC products needs to be audited themselves.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:20:46):**  Really so that's literally everybody from the fishers up to the retailer, even in those  more complex supply chains.  Yeah, exactly. And so we offer DNA testing, or have done in the past, that shows that  
**[0:20:57-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:20:57):**  MSC certified supply chains are more likely to riddle out fraud and mislabelling than  non-certified supply chains as a result.  So presumably the DNA testing is one way of monitoring compliance. It's not something  
**[0:21:12-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:21:12):**  that you're going to do on every fish that comes through the system. And I guess that  sort of goes back to that question around transparency and compliance, how you can ensure  that something that's come from somewhere else in the world or locally, by the time  
**[0:21:27-0:21:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:21:27):**  it actually gets to the consumer, is genuinely as sustainable as the label says that it is.  Is it a mountain of paperwork or is all of this, you know, kind of zapped with QR codes  and barcodes?  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:21:39):**  Yeah, so I think the big challenge for certification schemes, I think, at the moment is to digitise  and modernise. It's a very, very data heavy and input heavy process. And it's by far in  terms of what I'm aware of, one of the most rigorous in terms of eco labels on products.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:21:58):**  We have data throughout the supply chain, not just at the beginning to verify the sustainability  of the fish, but at the end as well to verify the quantities and the volumes of the products  with the label on as well. And I think that the future can only be a digital one and MSC  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:22:14):**  is investing in that to ensure that you've got far quicker than immediate data available,  not just for the auditors and the companies operating, but for the consumer at the other  end. So at the moment, it's still quite paper based. It's still auditors visiting fisheries  
**[0:22:30-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:22:30):**  in person and going through checklists and then uploading that. I think the use of apps  and QR codes, which are actually being used in these supply chains at the moment by some  companies, that has to be the future. This image of a small fishing boat out there, maybe  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:22:47):**  a bit rusty in the ocean is really, I think, true in some cases, but worlds away from technology  and the kind of modern nature of fishing. Even the example I gave for the Cornish sardines,  those guys have a wife on their vessels. They're using state of the art equipment to target  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:23:04):**  fish that are coming into their area. And in a similar way, the data that's then harvested  from those catches can be used to monitor the sustainability of stocks. And we're then,  as an organisation, able to use that information to put warning signs out to the supply chains  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:23:20):**  if there's certain risks coming up around stock management.  So we've talked there quite a bit about the way in which you actually certify the products  and the way that each of the links between the supply chain will be certified in and  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:23:32):**  of themselves. I'm just wondering, you know, we sort of come back to the UK and think about  it from a customer perspective. There's a huge array of seafood products available around  the world. But in terms of Britain, what are the key species or products that we're likely  
**[0:23:46-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:23:46):**  to see out there with the blue MSC eco label? We have in the UK what most people that work  in my industry call the big five. So that's salmon, prawns, cod, haddock and tuna. The  majority of cod and haddock that you'll find in supermarkets will have the MSC label on  
**[0:24:02-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:24:02):**  it. Those are, yeah, always going to be wild caught pretty much in supermarkets. Salmon  and prawns, slightly different. The majority of salmon that we find in the UK is farmed,  so not eligible for MSC certification. Well, that's something else that I was going  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:24:17):**  to ask you about actually, which is aquaculture, because, you know, we know that around 52%  of the fish that are produced or consumed now in the world are coming from aquaculture  systems. And so when you're talking about, I think it was 16%, did you say, of wild caught  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:24:32):**  fish or MSC certified? So that's 16% of the 48%. Do you already certify aquaculture products?  Are there plans to certify aquaculture products? No, so MSC was set up as a wild certification  standard. So predominantly it's pure wild fishing that is eligible for MSC certification.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:24:51):**  There's some grey areas, things like mussels and oysters, which we call enhanced fishing.  So there's not a huge amount of human intervention in those food systems. So they can qualify  for an MSC certification, but most traditional sort of fish farming would not be eligible  
**[0:25:09-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:25:09):**  for MSC. So the salmon farming that you generally see around the UK or particularly up in Scotland  is not eligible for MSC certification. It would be eligible for things like aquaculture  stewardship capture certification. And that's the farmed fishing standard that we as an  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:25:27):**  organisation most closely aligned with. So your expertise, your real interest is in the  wild caught fish and making sure that the wild caught fisheries become as sustainable  as possible and continue on that route because sustainability of course isn't a point in  
**[0:25:43-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:25:43):**  time. It's a process. So it's becoming as sustainable as possible and continuing to  be maintaining it. Now, another question with that kind of going back to that sort of idea  that wild caught fisheries, you know, lots of different fishers potentially from different  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:26:00):**  jurisdictions around a particular fishery. So when there aren't fences around the fishing  grounds, is it possible for the good work of a sustainable fishery, for example, the  one that you talked about in Cornwall there to be undone overnight by rogue fishers? I  
**[0:26:15-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:26:15):**  think it's possible, yes. I think ultimately, as I was explaining earlier, MSC certifications  take into account impacts on an entire fishery, not just the ones that are kind of going for  the blue label. Most fisheries are managed, you know, there are rules and regulations  
**[0:26:30-0:26:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:26:30):**  in place. If you look at waters around Europe, for instance, the stock management is such  that there's international agreements and rules and kind of frameworks that exist to  ensure that they're managed in a proper and appropriate way. Not always aligning with  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:26:46):**  the best scientific advice, which is what MSC certifications align with. But you can,  I think, in this day and age still get examples of illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing  occurring. And that's something that we call IUU. So there are bodies responsible for ensuring  
**[0:27:04-0:27:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:27:04):**  that IUU doesn't take place and, you know, penalties in place to deter and detract people  from doing that. If there was, you know, unregulated and unmanaged fishery taking place that was  present within that MSC fishery, then that would either be addressed through non-compliance  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:27:23):**  issues or legal issues resulting, or if it was unnoticed, it would come out in the data  that was used for an assessment. I mean, you know, the stock would naturally be, you know,  be going down. You talked about non-compliance issues there. If you have a fishery, a small  
**[0:27:36-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:27:36):**  fishery where a rogue fisher comes in and does some damage, or you have non-compliance,  do people lose the MSC certification instantly? Or is there a kind of a process of, you know,  years or months that you go through with them to see if they can retain it? It would really  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:27:52):**  depend, you know, on the case. So yes, it would obviously be taken into account fisheries  required if they're MSC certified to be compliant with local laws and regulations. And so if  an instance of IUU was taking place and it was causing real issues or affecting the scoring  
**[0:28:10-0:28:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:28:10):**  of that fishery, then it could be the case that a suspension of that fishery is given  effectively. But it really does depend on the particular case and the severity of the,  you know, the action.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:28:22):**  Toby  Just going back to the bigger picture as we come towards the end of the programme. In  agriculture, we've become quite used to hearing the phrase less and better in terms  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:28:33):**  of meat and dairy production and consumption. Does the same thing apply to the sea? Should  we be eating less seafood?  Mark  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:28:39):**  Well, I think MSC's position would be the food choices of personal decisions. So MSC,  we want people in the UK and elsewhere to know that when they look for eco-labelled  products, it means that the fish and seafood inside it is sustainable. So if you choose  
**[0:28:55-0:29:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:28:55):**  to eat fish, or if you choose to eat more fish, looking for the blue eco-labelled will  help you be sure that it is sustainable. So I think that there's room for the UK population  to increase its fish consumption based around what the government recommends for a healthy  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:29:11):**  diet. And I think that if fish populations and fisheries are well managed and sustainable,  then you can service that demand. You can service current demand and you can service  increased demand as well. So I don't think it's necessarily about eating more or eating  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:29:25):**  less. It's just taking that personal decision yourself as a consumer and using good information  that's available to make an informed decision that's in line with your values and your choices.  Toby  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:29:37):**  So we're coming towards the end of the programme, as I say, but just thinking about the future,  there's an increasing interest in blue carbon in the same way that when we plough the fields,  we release carbon, we were talking about that, you know, there's analogies with the seabed  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:29:48):**  earlier on. Do climate change and carbon sequestration come into the MSC certification process?  James Not really, just to be clear. So the difficulty  I think in operating a globally relevant standard that becomes more and more important to consumers  
**[0:30:06-0:30:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:30:06):**  and supply chain partners as well, is that there's a real tendency for responsibility  creep. And there's areas that MSCs evolved into such as on land labour requirements,  and other areas as well. Carbon and climate is an area that I think some stakeholders  
**[0:30:24-0:30:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:30:24):**  would like to see MSC adopt. But the certification of fisheries at the moment doesn't take into  account carbon or climate impacts.  Toby  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:30:34):**  Do you think it's likely to in the future?  James  It could do. I think it's, you know, all dependent on what stakeholders in the programme really  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:30:41):**  want to see. We operate a kind of five year cycle of review for the fishery standard,  which we're currently in at the moment. At the moment, the kind of hot topics are endangered,  threatened protected species, ghost gear or plastics, you know, impacts fisheries, things  
**[0:30:58-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:30:58):**  like shark finning as well mitigating those types of issues. So there's opportunity to  evolve and include new aspects to the standard, but that's not going to take place in, you  know, on the carbon side of things this time around. So it could be next time that that  
**[0:31:14-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:31:14):**  topics on the table. It's tough, isn't it? I think when you look at the roots of the  organisation and the name on the label, it's certified sustainable seafood. And so when  you actually break all those different component parts down, it's quite easy to explain and  
**[0:31:29-0:31:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:31:29):**  describe what that actually means in fisheries terms. The one difficulty area, I suppose,  is that word sustainable. And that word sustainable means many different things to many different  people. And as these issues become more prevalent or understood, of course, that definition  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:31:46):**  in some stakeholders minds will broaden out to include things like labour practices or  plastics in the ocean or climate impacts as well. The consumer kind of trend to be interested  to want to buy demonstrably sustainable products is what's driving fisheries towards improvement  
**[0:32:03-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:32:03):**  and towards engaging with the MSC programme. So I'm, you know, optimistic that we can meet  those goals and attain 30% of the world's catch in the programme. But what's most exciting  and interesting for me, and I'll bring it back to the UK level because I'm in the UK,  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:32:18):**  of course, is that pre certification space, we have a brilliant project that we help facilitate  called Project UK. And that's working with fisheries around England, Scotland, Wales  and Ireland to help them move towards that bar of sustainability. And I think that this  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:32:35):**  renewed interest in local fish, we might see in a few years time, the array of MSC label  products that are caught and landed by UK boats and UK waters grow. And I think that  that's something that UK consumers will be very interested in.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/MSC-Certified---How-does-it-work-e11g4bs#t=0:32:50):**  Fantastic. George, that's been really fascinating.

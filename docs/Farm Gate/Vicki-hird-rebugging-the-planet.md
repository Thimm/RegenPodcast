**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finlow Costain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell. My guest  today is Vicky Hurd, an expert and author who's been at the heart of environment, food  and farming policy discussions for over 30 years. Vicky is currently the head of sustainable  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:00:19):**  farming at Sustain, a regular advisor to the UK government and a veteran of parliamentary  committees. Before that, she worked at War on Wands and at Friends of the Earth. Well,  Vicky's got a new book out. Re-bugging the Planet is set to be the must-buy stocking  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:00:33):**  filler for Christmas this year. And in her wonderfully engaging style, Vicky shows us  that bugs are beautiful, inventive, charismatic, sociable and economically valuable. And at  a time when there's so much focus on the contentious and at times rather disempowering  
**[0:00:48-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:00:48):**  movement for large-scale rewilding, Re-bugging the Planet shows us that in the micro-worlds  of insects, beetles, spiders and slugs, each and every one of us can play our part and  help to restore nature. Vicky Hurd, welcome to the programme.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:01:03):**  Thank you very much, Finlow, and for that fantastic introduction.  Right, richly deserved. And Vicky, why bugs? Why have you written the book now?  Yes, well, there were sort of three things that were hitting me at a particular time  
**[0:01:14-0:01:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:01:14):**  a couple of years ago when I came up with the idea. One was the huge evidence that was  growing based on trend surveys of the loss of insect diversity and numbers across the  globe. And there was also a feeling that more people in the UK are interested in bugs. There's  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:01:31):**  a lot of interest in the bug surveys that you can do as a citizen, the citizen science,  like, you know, Mosswatch and Bwatch and all those kind of things. And I also love bugs.  I always have been a big invertebrate lover. And I put three things together and I thought  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:01:46):**  I could write some tips to help people who weren't getting ideas that they can do. There  was also rewilding. You know, it's become such a topic that I thought, well, if we can  do rewilding, like rebirding, why not rebugging? That's where the name came from.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:02:00):**  Absolutely. Listen, I wonder if you could sort of help us out with this idea that, you  know, there is this big crash, this insectageddon, if you like, because when you talk to people,  you know, driving up and down the motorway, you'll get anecdotal evidence that there are  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:02:14):**  many fewer bugs being killed on windscreens. But then you speak to somebody else and they  say, well, it's because cars are more aerodynamic. So, so what is the evidence that we're seeing  this big crash in the numbers of arthropods and insects?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:02:27):**  There was a very particularly noteworthy study that was done in Germany. I think it was a  50 year study in the same fields and spaces showing that a number of flying insects had  really crashed over the last few decades. And that got a lot of attention and insectageddon  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:02:43):**  kind of headlines. But then that started to get more journalists interested in all the  other studies that are being done across the globe, often in more affluent areas. So there's  a problem there. We do need more data. We need more understanding of what's happened  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:02:57):**  in the global south, for instance. But also we don't really know what we've got. You know,  we don't, we don't know all the bugs out there. There's probably no about 10% of the actual  invertebrates that we know. Whereas the rest we haven't actually discovered yet.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:03:10):**  That's remarkable, isn't it?  It is. It is. I mean, they are so numerous, so extraordinarily diverse as a group of animals  that it's quite incredible. But the data is really growing and the metadata, scientists  
**[0:03:22-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:03:22):**  have pulled it all together. And whilst they do say we do need more research and it's not  across the board and there's lots, some insects are doing really well and some invertebrates  doing really well, especially the non-specialist bugs. They can be very flexible in what they  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:03:36):**  eat, where they go, the climate and everything. They can do well. But it's the other very,  very important bugs, the pollinators, the spiders and other critical bugs are actually  crushing in many, many places. And people have noticed, as you say, the loss of bugs  
**[0:03:51-0:03:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:03:51):**  and butterflies and moths around them when they go into the countryside, for instance.  Min, you mentioned academics and it would be strange if academics were ever telling  you they didn't need more research in a particular area. But it seems, you know, that the trend  
**[0:04:05-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:04:05):**  is clear, isn't it? There's nowhere in the world that's bucking the trend, that suddenly  seeing a growth in species everywhere. We're seeing this decline and it's being recorded  anecdotally by farmers, by academics and recognised at UN level and government level as well.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:04:19):**  So it's really timely. And I just want to, because through your work and, you know, through  your life and your career, you've encountered many groups of people. And I wonder who the  particular intended audiences are for this book, for Re-Bugging the Planet. Because it's  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:04:34):**  not full of loads of pictures, even much as it's got wonderful little vignettes of information.  Yes, I think it's for the people who've become probably a bit more aware. So young people,  you know, sort of older teens and onwards all the way to, you know, much older people,  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:04:49):**  but they've become aware of the beauty of insects through things like BBC Spring Watch,  but also aware of the headlines. And so it's, you know, I do talk about farming and your  clothes and consumption and all those kinds of things. And there are tips in there and  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:05:04):**  ideas about what farmers can do and what they should be doing, what other industries that  have an impact. But it is generally for the public, a public audience that's got interested  and wants to know more, particularly wants to know what they can do. So there's loads  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:05:17):**  of boxes of tips and ideas in all parts of your life. And that's what I wanted to, that's  where it started from really, tips and ideas for the general public.  One of the things I love about it is that you've got all these little information boxes  
**[0:05:28-0:05:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:05:28):**  and stories throughout the book that make the info really accessible. You know, I've  given the book to my nine year old and I said to him, look, you don't have to read the whole  thing, but just dip into those boxes. One of my favourite facts is that there was a  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:05:39):**  super colony of Argentinian ants that's been found in Southern Europe that people reckon  stretches for 3,700 miles with 33 ant populations, millions of nests, billions of workers. I  mean, that's just incredible. How do people even know that?  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:05:55):**  Yes, well, the Argentinian ant is extraordinary. I mean, it's one of those generalists. It's  really flexible and able to recolonise an area and as such, it can actually displace  the native ant species. So it's of concern to entomologists in different parts of the  
**[0:06:10-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:06:10):**  world and different countries where they see these ants which have come on through global  trade, they piggyback on those things, on those journeys and invade a new area, potentially  displace the local ants and that can be a problem if those ants are particularly important  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:06:25):**  for ecology. And as such, they've been studied and it's absolutely extraordinary. Colonies,  thousands and thousands of miles away can recognise each other. It's like Manchester  United fans across the globe, when they meet each other, they can be friendly, but if you're  
**[0:06:40-0:06:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:06:40):**  Arsenal fans, no way, you won't be able to talk, you'll fight. It's that kind of thing.  They will fight other ant species, but not their own, however far away in time and space  they are. Now, you clearly loved bugs since you were very small. Do you have a favourite  
**[0:06:54-0:06:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:06:54):**  bug? And actually, is there a bug that you want to rehabilitate in some way more than  any other? A bug that's perhaps serially misunderstood? Well, it's difficult to have a favourite,  but I do tend to always want to see a cock chafer or Maybug or Dunebug, whatever. It's  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:07:10):**  got many, many names across the globe. It's a beautiful large beetle with incredible antennae.  They're kind of renowned for being a bit daft and just flying into things.  Yes, bumbling beetles with not great eyesight, but they're beautiful when you look at them  
**[0:07:25-0:07:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:07:25):**  on clothes, as most invertebrates are. But in terms of rehabilitating, I would say spiders  because so many people are frightened of them or automatic reaction to them. I think there  is a visceral reaction people have. So I tend to not use a spider picture if I'm doing an  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:07:38):**  article because that means a lot of people won't even read the article. Whereas wasps,  I mean, people just don't understand how important wasps are for pest control and for pollination.  They're extraordinary valuable species. And for waste management as well.  
**[0:07:51-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:07:51):**  Exactly. The amount of flies that are wasps and all caterpillars that you might see as  a problem in your garden, the amount they'll clear up for you. If you've got a wasp nest  nearby, they'll be doing a fantastic pest control that you might not be aware of.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:08:05):**  It's interesting. And of course, you mentioned spiders there. And of course, we brought up  from the crib, you know, sort of little Miss Muffet who sat on her tuffet right through  to Tolkien and Aragog. You know, spiders are scary things. And, you know, we've got this  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:08:18):**  issue with my seven year old at the moment. He wasn't particularly scared of spiders.  Something happened. I forget exactly what. But now he's kind of that slightly sort of  screaming stage. There must be a kind of a human innate response to this that stems back  
**[0:08:32-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:08:32):**  to the, I mean, in the UK, there aren't really any dangerous spiders, but we must still have  that inbuilt in our DNA in some way. Interestingly, a psychologist has told me  the only things we've got within our DNA in terms of reacting like that is sound. So it's  
**[0:08:47-0:08:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:08:47):**  loud noises and speed or something. I can't remember. It's nothing to do with the invertebrates.  So we don't necessarily have in our DNA, but it you're right. It's hard to believe that  it's not an innate, natural fear that's built into all of us. But I think one of the reasons  
**[0:09:00-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:09:00):**  I wrote the book and why I'm promoting it is to get adults and carers to instil a more  nuanced view of bugs in their children or children they're caring for, because you can  very quickly instil the fear something can happen and children very quickly then stop  
**[0:09:18-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:09:18):**  having their wonderful curiosity and love of bugs turns into something fearful. And  so I want people to change their attitude to bugs. So there was a whole chapter called  Re-Bugging Our Attitudes. That is a really, really important start to the whole process.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:09:33):**  I wonder, just sort of moving on, because you mentioned rewilding earlier and we're  thinking here about re-bugging, which is the micro version. I wonder what you think of  rewilding more broadly and how it fits alongside agroecology and regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:09:46-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:09:46):**  which of course are the things that we're particularly interested in in the Farmgate  podcast. Because it's always seemed to me that the rewilding movement wants to take  land away and set it aside for nature, while agroecology aims to actively regenerate nature  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:10:00):**  within a farming environment while actively producing great food. Is that a fair assessment?  I think it is a fair assessment. I think we're in a state of flux at the moment and people  are getting very excited and there's a lot of investment and obviously climate change  
**[0:10:14-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:10:14):**  is getting a lot of people interested in planting more trees in order to store more carbon.  So that's all, I think we're in a really big transition phase at the moment. But what's  at risk here is a load of farms that could be doing things that are really good for nature,  
**[0:10:28-0:10:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:10:28):**  for the bugs, whilst also producing food. And it's absolutely critical that we become  resilient in our food supply. Every country, this isn't a nationalistic thing, every country  should have more resilience in its food supply and in its food system so we waste less, we  
**[0:10:43-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:10:43):**  don't waste crops on feeding it to cars and things like that. But the critical thing is  that we do actually take account of farming systems as part of the regeneration of nature  and climate mitigation. And so agroecology is at the heart of that. So I'm really nervous  
**[0:11:00-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:11:00):**  that people forget about the farming side and just say, let's rewild and as you say,  set land aside for nature in areas where we could really be doing both.  It's interesting, isn't it? The way that people, when we talk about rewilding, there is a sort  
**[0:11:12-0:11:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:11:12):**  of a natural instinct to be attracted towards the stories of the larger animals, the more  beautiful animals like wolves, or if we're talking about the oceans, then whales and  that sort of thing. And yet it is these micro worlds that are so important. One of my personal  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:11:27):**  obsessions is soil. And even when we're talking about re-bugging, if I talk about re-bugging,  really in my mind, I'm thinking of the spiders and the caterpillars and wasps and things  like that, that you might see in a flower pot or a window box. But actually we're talking  
**[0:11:40-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:11:40):**  about those microbes and microscopic creatures in the soil as well, which are the bedrock  of biodiversity.  Well, absolutely. It's extraordinary the amount of invertebrates there are in soil. I mean,  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:11:51):**  you can get millions of springtails in a small hectare. You know, springtails are really  important small critters that actually look beautiful, but most people have never heard  of and they're extraordinary, but you've got your worms.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:12:03):**  Can you describe them? What are springtails?  They're very, there's one called a globular springtail, which is a wonderful thing. It  has six legs and it looks a bit like an insect, but it's a different order. They're very fat  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:12:12):**  and round and they do a huge amount of regurgitating plant matter to smaller pieces so that the  microbes and fungi can break it down further to release the nutrients. And the snails and  the slugs and the worms that go through soils, all these are very critically important, but  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:12:30):**  you know, that soil is an amazing refuge. And as you say, it's unbelievably full of  invertebrates and an important refuge. So are the small ponds that farmers put in. So  the hedgerows that farmers put in and can put in and the woodlands and individual trees,  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:12:46):**  all these are critical refuges and corridors for invertebrates to mate in, to travel through,  to recolonise. And they're, you know, that's an important part. Forget about that and just  say, no, let's farm intensively on that land and take away the refuges because they  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:13:00):**  use some of the land or they waste, you know, they've seen to be inefficient, therefore  sparing land for rewilding. You're going to be missing a whole load of important refuges  that are on farmland, good farmland.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:13:13):**  And you mentioned snails there as well. And I'm just sort of, you know, again, thinking  back to, you know, those micro worlds or those macro worlds, a lot of gardeners, you know,  they see snails and their instinct is to, is to immediately get them out of the garden  
**[0:13:24-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:13:24):**  if they possibly can. But actually a garden without snails would be a pretty dead place,  wouldn't it? It's about restoring that balance because presumably snails are filtering soil,  even making new soil.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:13:34):**  They are, they're absolutely critical. And the thing that most snails like most is dead  plant matter. So if you haven't got snails or slugs, you'll have a lot of dead plant  matter in your, unless you clear it all away, in which case you're clearing away the habitats  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:13:46):**  for them, but also for really beneficial bugs like ladybirds and beetles, which are really  important in terms of regurgitating the plant matter into soil. But also some of them are  really good pest control. A lot of beetles really love eating aphids, for instance. Yeah.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:14:02):**  But snails are critical and you can grow plants in your garden that in ways that protect the  plants that you want to protect from snails or grow, if you've got a particularly snail  filled area, which I have in my garden, grow plants that snails don't like.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:14:15):**  So that's Re-bugging the Planet, which is, as I say, it's a fantastic book and you know,  congratulations on it because it's, it's marvellous and it's available. And of course we're in  the run up to Christmas and I think over the last four or five years, I've been aware that  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:14:28):**  there's been one big eco book that everybody has got for Christmas. And I'm really hoping  that this is, that this is that book this year. But moving on to your other work, you've  been heavily engaged with the UK's Department for Food Environment and Rural Affairs throughout  
**[0:14:42-0:14:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:14:42):**  the years of discussion since the Brexit referendum. And for people on all sides of the European  debate, the opportunity to redefine the relationship between agriculture and the natural world  has been a shining light in what many would see as a pretty dark period. And so for all  
**[0:14:59-0:15:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:14:59):**  the positive talk, are British farmers and is the British countryside going to be genuinely  better off, do you think, once these changes are embedded?  Oh, that's a big question. I thought I'd picture an easy one.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:15:12):**  Yeah, in my heart that I think yes, and I really want it to happen. And that's why I  came back to working on UK domestic farm policy several years ago to help shape what the future  farm support system would look like. Because we, as you say, we have this unique opportunity  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:15:27):**  to get it right, and show leadership in getting it right. We are still on track to do that.  The new schemes that DEFRA are developing could really help all farmers get on the route  to more sustainable farming, to agro-ecological systems, however far they want to go. Not  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:15:44):**  all of them can go all the way, but there's so many things that they could be doing, and  that should be supported by the government in doing that, they deliver public goods,  but will also be really good for them as climate shocks, more unstable weather patterns, more  
**[0:15:58-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:15:58):**  ecological collapse happens within, you know, within even within the UK in systems such  as we get more droughts and floods. All those things mean that farms need to be more resilient  and more diverse, and that should all be supported through, you know, diverse in terms of what  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:16:12):**  crops they're growing or livestock they're producing, but also diverse in terms of the  habitat types in their farm. All those things will help.  And of course, you know, you mentioned the way that UK farms need to become more resilient  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:16:23):**  because of the climate impacts that we're going to experience here, but also because,  you know, those climate impacts are going to ramp up around the world, and so we're  not going to be in a position simply to import food, you know, perhaps in 20 years time to  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:16:34):**  the extent that we are now. We're going to have to, you know, rebuild that national independence.  Yeah, absolutely. I think that there's so many factors in that, but, you know, water  stress is definitely something that's going to happen, and people have analysed the imports  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:16:48):**  that we have of food now, and a third of our imports are in areas that are going to get  very quickly major water stress. And should we be taking produce from around the world  when they, you know, other countries should possibly be building their own food systems  
**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:17:01):**  for their own communities and regional food needs. But there's also the factor of how  much we use food for useful things. And, you know, given that a third of the food we produce  or we buy is wasted, I think we need to really tackle food waste as a major issue, because  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:17:19):**  that really undermines our ability to have food or nutritional security in the UK.  Now, you mentioned waste there as something that we need to sort out if we're going to  sort of re-establish a greater level of national independence in terms of the food that we  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:17:33):**  produce and eat ourselves. But trade is another thing that I know that you're very concerned  about, you've written about and you've talked about on a regular basis, in terms of the  trade deals that the UK government is doing elsewhere around the world. Now, why isn't  
**[0:17:50-0:17:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:17:50):**  the government listening to people like you and I, and even the EFRA committee and the  NFU on the issue of a level playing field on standards?  I think it's an ideology and a belief that we should be trading and have a really strong  
**[0:18:06-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:18:06):**  free trade agenda. And that's ignoring all the things that are actually important for  us as human beings on this planet, that a free trade, a trade system that is entirely  there for global trading companies to do whatever they want to do. And that's what we've had  
**[0:18:23-0:18:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:18:23):**  for a long time in many senses with the global food system. And I think it's absolutely appalling  that a huge coalition of people from members of the public to the National Farmers Union,  all our members, as you say, all of us have been saying we want a level playing field,  
**[0:18:40-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:18:40):**  we want to protect our food standards. And in fact, DIT, Department of International  Trade's own studies of public perceptions of trade increasingly show that they are really  keen as a primary role of trade to protect our farmers and protect our food standards  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:18:57):**  for health and environment and animal welfare. So everybody wants this. And yet, the Department  of International Trade and a small echelon of people that are completely in power are  ignoring all that and doing trade deals, which could undermine our standards and could undermine  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:19:12):**  all the efforts farmers and defra are making to do things differently to really protect  animal welfare and environment. It's baffling and frustrating. And we've still got to fight,  to be honest, we've still got that fight. Do you think there's an element of fear and  
**[0:19:25-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:19:25):**  vulnerability that's shown through this position that the government has? The government is  so desperate to make Brexit a success and it's so scared of failure that it doesn't  want to constrain itself any more than it absolutely has to when it goes out to get  
**[0:19:44-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:19:44):**  a trade deal with this small country there, this small country there, or, you know, let  alone the larger countries around. I think you're right. They want to be seen  to be a global player and able to do what they promised that they would do when they  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:19:57):**  did the referendum. But that's ignoring all the different things that are really facing  us now as a society. It's like almost blinkers. It's like back in a few decades ago thinking  about what matters. Economics has moved on. You know, the idea, the ideology of free trade  
**[0:20:12-0:20:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:20:12):**  is not where we need to be at. We need to think of economics in a different way. We're  not on an infinite planet of resources and natural resources. The bugs are running out.  Soil is running out. You know, that all makes economics need to be done differently. And  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:20:26):**  that means free trade is not where we should be heading. We should have trading dependent  on protecting both livelihoods, workers and the planet and the systems that we depend  on. And you say it needs to be done differently.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:20:39):**  And you talk about the, you know, the Conservatives ideology, which is driving this. And yet I'm  always struck by, you know, Conservatives and Conservative thinkers will often, you  know, bring out Adam Smith. He is their great enlightened thinker in terms of free trade.  
**[0:20:54-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:20:54):**  But Adam Smith wasn't about unregulated, untrammeled free trade. He was about free trade and wrecking  the market. And he recognised that there needed to be regulations and frameworks in order  for that trade to happen. You know, unless you were literally in a marketplace where  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:21:09):**  you could go and compare one storeholders meet with another storeholders meet. You needed  some regulations and you needed to actively create that level playing field.  He made it very clear, didn't he? Yeah. In all his work that we need those regulations,  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:21:22):**  those systems, those frameworks, and we need them more than ever right now because we're  facing, you know, climate breakdown and we've got obesity crisis globally as well. We've  got, I don't know if you've seen the recent news about food prices, you know, they're  
**[0:21:35-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:21:35):**  going through the reef. We've got to be doing these things in ways that really protect societies  needs now and in the future. There's a future generations issue in all this, protecting  the land so we can continue to feed ourselves. So yeah, I think he was right about that and  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:21:52):**  we don't have them. And what's frustrating when we did campaign for protection within  trade protection for food stands and trade rooms, the government gave us a little bit  of a concession in a trade and agriculture commission, which came out with its findings  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:22:08):**  many months ago. And the government has still not responded to those findings and it still  hasn't set up the new statutory trade and agriculture commission. You know, meanwhile  our trade department is going around making deals and doing negotiations behind closed  
**[0:22:20-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:22:20):**  doors and it's totally unacceptable. We should at least have a response to that commission's  demands on keeping trade standards.  And that was what the commission recommended, wasn't it? It said very clearly that those  
**[0:22:32-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:22:32):**  standards needed to be there, that if we were going to deliver sustainability to any extent  in Britain, then we needed to make sure that food that was coming in wasn't undermining  those standards as we went forward.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:22:44):**  And being a global leader in those standards, that's, you know, we can do that. We can talk  about how and why we're doing this. It's important to ratchet up the standards, not a race to  the bottom.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:22:53):**  Yeah. We keep talking about this leadership, this post Brexit leadership position, don't  we? But then we, we kind of, as a, as a nation, we've kind of run away from it as soon as  there's this opportunity to really show global leadership. I wonder in Defra, whether there's  
**[0:23:06-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:23:06):**  a sense that people in Defra, the secretary of state, that they really, that actually  they really get this stuff and it's just that they are unable to deliver because they are  a weak department in comparison with the Department of Trade or Treasury or whoever else, or is  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:23:22):**  it that there is still this kind of shilly, shallying around the policy discussion within  Defra itself at the top?  I think you're right. No, I think your first characterisation is correct. It feels like  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:23:32):**  Defra is not getting what it needs in this process because higher up there's a desire,  such a strong desire to show that Brexit works, that we're a global player and we can, you  know, we're powerful and it's a ridiculous position really, you know, you're only powerful  
**[0:23:47-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:23:47):**  as long as you can maintain your strong weapons. And we won't be able to because we're a small  country, but we do have a strong farming system and the ability to produce diverse foods across  the UK. We should be investing in that and building that resilience, which I talked about  
**[0:24:03-0:24:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:24:03):**  and protecting the natural systems like the bugs, rather than automatically assuming it's  going to be better to import cheaper food like from Australia, the beef feedlot systems  in Australia. You know, there's some great beef producers in Australia, I'm sure, and  
**[0:24:16-0:24:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:24:16):**  I know there are, but the feedlot systems are incredibly harmful.  And we have great beef produced in the UK.  Exactly, exactly. So why not champion and support those and doing what they need to  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:24:26):**  do and champion that to consumers so consumers know what to buy to support pasture-based  systems which are really good for biodiversity and the methane emissions, you know, it's  a complex area, but you know, you're building in carbon stocks in a pasture-based system  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:24:42):**  in the soil and then the plant matter. So there's great things which are completely  undermining if we go and import load of beef from Australia. It's extraordinary.  It's always seemed very strange to me, you know, as somebody who is so invested in land  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:24:55):**  use in general, I'm sure it does to you that Defra is seen as one of these sort of lower  departments and especially in this COP year when COP26 is coming to Glasgow, when we have  a climate emergency, we have a biodiversity crisis, we are an island nation, we need to  
**[0:25:10-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:25:10):**  be able to feed ourselves. And land use is such a critical factor in being able to deliver  on any of these various different issues, whether that's food, whether that's security  for our population because people have still got enough to eat and drink in the future,  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:25:27):**  whether it's addressing climate mitigation or adaptation or biodiversity restoration,  it all comes back to land. And it strikes me that, you know, I mean, farmers through  CAP were receiving 3.1 billion quid and just administering central government costs 11  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:25:45):**  billion quid, which just gives us an indication of the way that the government and the way  that society more broadly views the importance of agriculture. And that 3.1 billion, if that  was sustained, comes down, I think per citizen to just less than one pound per citizen per  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:26:00):**  week to manage three quarters of these islands. So money's really important, partly because  farmers need support and partly because that support can be a strong lever for change.  And the government has always said that it's going to continue funding at the levels, at  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:26:16):**  least at the levels that farmers were getting under CAP. But I've been looking at the terms  for the new sustainable farming incentive, which is this sort of bridging policy for  English farms, English being distinct from Welsh or Scottish because they've got different  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:26:29):**  policies there before the substantive reforms come in in 2024. And soil improvement is a  key outcome, which is fantastic, completely support that. But the rates are so low and  the basic farm payment under CAP in 2018, I think I'm right in saying it was around  
**[0:26:45-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:26:45):**  £90 an acre, give or take. But here the soil payments are set for between £10 and £28  an acre. I mean, what's going on there? Are farmers just being given a really bummed deal?  I think it is a problem. And it's not just the soil standards that I'm hearing that over  
**[0:27:02-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:27:02):**  and over again, the rates are too low. There's an issue with the way in which the payment  methodology has been done, because they wanted to do it based on public goods, you know,  assessing the value of the public goods and giving the farmer the recognition of that  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:27:16):**  value by paying them per hectare or per metre. And they haven't been able to do that. So  they've gone back to sort of old systems that they've had for the ag environment schemes,  and possibly cut them even further. I mean, I'm told that this is a pilot that we're learning  
**[0:27:31-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:27:31):**  that they're going to be changed. And I'm being told that a lot by Defra that the payment  rates will be evaluated through the pilot. But what you're talking about is the soil  values for next year's rollout, which is the start of it all really, available for all  
**[0:27:45-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:27:45):**  farmers in receipt of BPS. So if they're hearing this, they're going to say, well, that's not  enough. I'm going to go help leather get more animals or a more intensive farming system,  which is exactly what we shouldn't be doing. We should be having really productive, but  
**[0:28:00-0:28:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:28:00):**  sustainable farming systems being driven by this new policy. So it is a huge worry. And  I know Defra are beholden to the Treasury and what they can get out. So we're very clear  that there needs to be an adequate budget for the scale of need and for advice and all  
**[0:28:15-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:28:15):**  the ancillary processes that need to happen to support farmers in this, not least supply  chain and infrastructure. So there's so many things that money is paid for. As you say,  there's nothing more important to be able to feed ourselves. And land use, we should  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:28:27):**  have a land use framework that really ensures that we're using the right thing in the right  piece of land for the right outcomes. And that's very difficult where we don't know  who owns a lot of the land in the UK. And we don't have control in England of land use  
**[0:28:41-0:28:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:28:41):**  or land use strategy as they do in Scotland, for instance. So there's a lot of issues within  that that need to be resolved. And I really hope they grasp the idea of having a land  use strategy because without it, we could become a real mess with a lot of trees planted  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:28:55):**  without the biodiversity benefits and a loss of land for farming for agri-tological farming.  I just want to take advantage of you being here because I think if anybody understands  you know where the money is supposed to come from, then you're probably the person who  
**[0:29:10-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:29:10):**  can help us out with that. And there will be English farmers who are listening to this  podcast and hearing that figure around the sustainable farming incentive. Presumably  that can't be the only money that's on offer to farmers. Is there a sliding scale sort  
**[0:29:26-0:29:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:29:26):**  of going away from BPS that farmers that were getting such and such will get a proportion  of that, that there's other funds that they can dip into? How's it going to work, Vicki?  There are several things in play at the moment. There's consultation on the lump sum scheme.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:29:41):**  Farmers will be able to get their current payments in a lump sum as opposed to sort  of annual basis if they want to. That's one of the schemes, exit scheme as well, to be  supported in leaving farming. And there are obviously a lot of schemes for technology  
**[0:29:56-0:30:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:29:56):**  and productivity advancements, things that they've outlined in the agricultural transition  plan that they're going ahead with. A number of schemes also for animal health and welfare.  That's going to be launched next year in a small way and there'll be money for supporting  
**[0:30:11-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:30:11):**  animal health and welfare improvements on farm and for environmental improvements, capital  grants, things like that. So there are going to be a suite of schemes, but it does worry  me that a lot of farmers don't even have business planning. Do they have adequate understanding  
**[0:30:26-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:30:26):**  of how all this can fit together for them as the BPS cuts are really cutting in from  next year and onwards. So Elms in England, the Elms scheme isn't supposed to be replacing  BPS. It's not, but inevitably a lot of farmers will be seeing that as an income stream that  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:30:42):**  they need. And so it'll have to work for them. But also it's worth noting, Finlow, that there's  going to be a basic middle and advanced level to each scheme or most of them. So you'll  be able to transition from a small fee for what you do to a higher fee as you go further  
**[0:30:59-0:31:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:30:59):**  and you learn more. And I think many farms as they learn more and they do more, we'll  find it benefits them and their businesses as well as they get more money. So the critical  thing is that the money is there for all farmers to do something. And I'm not convinced that  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:31:13):**  we have a big enough budget going forward and Treasury doesn't seem to be as alive to  all those benefits and critical resilience features that we've got to build into our  farm system.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:31:24):**  It's interesting, isn't it? Because I mean, the Conservatives, if I could think back 10  or 15 years ago, used to make a lot of hay with the idea of this sort of bonfire of red  tape. And yet they seem to be creating a system which is just excessively bureaucratic. You  
**[0:31:37-0:31:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:31:37):**  know, certainly when you're replacing something, which is, and I know that the old system,  a lot of farmers complained that that was bureaucratic, but you know, you were largely  getting one or two different kinds of payments, whereas there are so many different kinds  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:31:49):**  of payments here. And is that a product partly of the fact that Defra is so big that there  are so many sub departments in there, each kind of presenting their own case individually,  rather than having this sort of integrated approach to becoming more sustainable?  
**[0:32:05-0:32:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:32:05):**  Well, it's fascinating. I first started working on agri-environment schemes in the middle  of the 90s. And there were eight schemes and I did a brochure to show around the country  what there was. And that seemed quite simple then. And now we've got this presentation  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:32:18):**  of eight pilot schemes, which is the first pilot, and each one has three levels. So you're  right, it's going to be complex. But at the same time, farming is complex. I think if  it was too simple, then it wouldn't reflect what, you know, the complexity of the different,  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:32:32):**  every farm is different and needs to do things different.  But it can be much more outcome based, couldn't it?  Yes, it could be.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:32:38):**  It could be as simple as we're going to continue with acreage payments, but you're  only going to get your payments if you deliver the outcomes. And these are the outcomes.  I mean, that would be a simple way of doing it.  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:32:46):**  The outcome based issue, though, was problematic. A lot of farmers said, well, what if it rains  and I can't deliver that? You know, what if there's skylarks aren't around that  year? There's lots of uncertainty in farming. So the outcome factor needed, you know, there  
**[0:32:59-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:32:59):**  was, I think you're right, it could have been an option to outcome factor plus, you  know, plus some activities and assets management recognition of that. But I think they could  also have had a whole farm payment that recognised those farmers that are doing things on the  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:33:12):**  whole farm, this, that and the other, which was optimal rather than maximal, optimal activities  that really protected places for nature, built in carbon on the whole farm system. That potentially  could be relatively simple and reporting could have been simple on a mapping basis. But we  
**[0:33:29-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:33:29):**  are where we are. And I want to be positive about Elms because I really want farmers to  engage with the process. So she's improved through farmer engagement and all types of  farmers. They're really missing horticulture, pigs, poultry, small farmers, all of them  
**[0:33:43-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:33:43):**  a bit of a gap at the moment. And so those farmers, we want them to engage, particularly  pigs and poultry, you know, there's big issues around those systems which need to be addressed  through Elms or through regulation, which needs to underpin the whole way in which we  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:33:55):**  support farming. I'm really interested in those terms that you use, which are lovely,  optimal or maximal. And it strikes me that that's kind of, through those words, you're  describing land sparing or land sharing, the land sparing of which rewilding seems to me  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:34:09):**  to be part. It's about using this bit of land to deliver the maximum benefit for this particular  thing rather than using land to deliver as much as possible, a whole range multifunction  of things to an optimum extent, which doesn't necessarily maximise any one or the other,  
**[0:34:25-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:34:25):**  but it delivers most things really very well. There might be a need for maximal for a particular  species that we really need to recover. And we know that and you know, the conservation  bodies are very allowed to that where it needs to happen. But I agree for the majority of  
**[0:34:37-0:34:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:34:37):**  farmland, we should be looking for the optimal outcomes for nature and climate and for livelihoods.  You also talked about, you indicated, I think, that you felt that farmers ought to be getting  a bit more than they're currently getting. So, if we work on the basis, they're getting  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:34:52):**  about three billion quid, give or take, how much do you think, how much more do you think  that they need? Well, it's hard for me to say. I mean, because I haven't done, you know,  really good data analysis. I know a piece of work by the RSPB looked at scale of need  
**[0:35:05-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:35:05):**  and it was around about three billion was needed just for the things that they knew  that we absolutely needed. It didn't cover many other aspects of food and farming, such  as resiliency in infrastructure and supply chains, and possibly didn't cover all the  
**[0:35:18-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:35:18):**  landscape things you'd want to do and farm based systems and diversity that we want to  build in into the farm and rotations, cover crops, all those kinds of things. So, you  know, we could be looking at sort of five billion or, you know, six billion. And it  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:35:33):**  doesn't necessarily mean forever. You know, we might be just talking about for a while  for a transition until farmers are actually on the ladder of agroecology understanding  and getting all the benefits for their business as well as the...  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:35:45):**  So this three billion isn't the end point. It's the entry point. It's the starting point.  Potentially. Yeah, absolutely. But we've got to convince the treasury that we're getting  value for money, which is pretty hard and things come very slowly in some farm systems,  
**[0:35:58-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:35:58):**  as you know. It's very difficult with government, isn't it? The accountants and the, you know,  this need for everything to fit inside an Excel spreadsheet when actually you just can't,  you need to take some things on trust in terms of land use and understand that a broad trend  
**[0:36:12-0:36:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:36:12):**  is good enough. You don't necessarily need an academic paper which gives you, you know,  the absolute specific details because that broad trend is, you know, is better than the  opposite trend, which is what we're getting so much of now.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:36:24):**  Yeah, but we've got to be measuring it. That's the other thing.  Of course, of course. We need to be measuring it. And of course, we can build that data  within, you know, that and adapt and adjust schemes as we go forward. But if things are  
**[0:36:37-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:36:37):**  improving, that's got to be good. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. We should have  rewards through the public and the marketplace as well, ideally.  Now, you also mentioned exit schemes there and I hope to goodness that we don't have,  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:36:49):**  you know, huge numbers of farmers choosing to take the exit schemes. But I do get the  impression from behind the scenes in government that there are really quite a lot of people  who would be quite comfortable if, as a result of the changes, we actually see quite a lot  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:37:03):**  of farm businesses closing, farms being aggregated, land being turned over to forestry where they  can sequester carbon through citrus, for example, or to rewilding projects. Am I being too cynical?  I've sensed this over the last four years that there are a certain, yeah, there is certainly  
**[0:37:20-0:37:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:37:20):**  a number of people in government and in the industry itself as well who see this as an  opportunity to get rid of the laggards, the small, you know, farm, inefficient farms,  the farms that have a business plan. And I wrote a blog at the beginning of this whole  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:37:34):**  process saying, are we going to see the death of small farms? And the reason I wrote it  was because that would be catastrophic. I think farms, you know, need the support and  advice to get better, you know, some of them to get better at doing what they're doing  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:37:46):**  and protect the environment. But to also make sure the way to do that is to get them out,  you know, go bust and get amalgamated into ever larger farms or into, as you say, plantations,  et cetera, is going to lose us so much of the fabric of the countryside, the features  
**[0:38:00-0:38:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:38:00):**  of the countryside. When farms amalgamate, you lose hedgerows, features that are critical,  for instance, for the bogs, and you lose jobs and you lose that rural cohesion. I mean,  there's very good studies showing this, that you need a matrix of small, medium and large  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:38:14):**  farms. This isn't about small farms are bad, small farms are good, large farms are bad.  It's that matrix and a progression for farmers as well. If you're very interested in new  entrants and government says it is, those new entrants need a progression to go through.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:38:27):**  So smaller farms and then go to bigger, more challenging as they learn the trade. And that  progression won't be possible if we've just got a handful of large farms in many areas.  And lots of small farms can be incredibly efficient.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:38:38):**  Exactly, exactly. Assuming they're not.  Fantastic outcomes as well in terms of sustainability.  Absolutely. And that should be recorded and rewarded. So yeah, I think I find it very  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:38:47):**  offensive when I hear people say that there's certain farms that are just so terrible they  need to get out. It might be a small number that do, but an awful lot. They've just struggled  against an incredibly harsh business environment, which has got worse and worse over the last  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:39:00):**  few decades. You know, the harsh pricing and contracts that they get. And it's very hard  for them to do things well. So we need to make sure things are done, you know, available  for them to learn how to do the business planning and the environmental planning and land use  
**[0:39:14-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:39:14):**  planning that they need to do to get a decent living.  And there's a degree to which, you know, we get the food and farming that we pay for,  that we deserve. And we are paying very, very little for food through the major retailers.  
**[0:39:25-0:39:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:39:25):**  We are paying very little to farmers to manage the countryside. So if we want a really good,  thriving, vibrant economy and environment in our countryside, then we need to pay for  it.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:39:37):**  Yeah. I mean, farmers get an average 9% of the gross value added in the agri-food system.  So they're getting less than 10% of what we all pay when we go into the shops or the  restaurants or the canteen or whatever. That amount will not allow them to invest in new  
**[0:39:51-0:39:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:39:51):**  systems to do the rotations, to learn how to do things differently, to change the yields,  potentially to have some yield drop. All those things that are big risk for farmers. They're  getting so little from the marketplace, which is why Sustains is doing a lot of work about  
**[0:40:04-0:40:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:40:04):**  finding alternative routes to markets and looking at supply chains and infrastructure,  which will allow that and seeing how farmers can collaborate and cooperate together to  build a new market outlet for everybody, not just for the elites, not just for the wealthy,  
**[0:40:18-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:40:18):**  but for everybody. And I think that will, you know, we can hope that retailers, the  big multiples get nicer. I'm not convinced they will when they're competing with the  Amazon on the high street now. I have near me an Amazon high street store selling food.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:40:32):**  So I think we need alternative routes and those, you know, those are more interesting  now with COVID. People are more interested in buying locally, but it needs to be available  for everybody, not just, you know, those who can afford a very expensive delivery every  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:40:45):**  week. It's looking at that, how it can work in every town, every city and rural areas  as well.  And we need a campaign for farmers just to receive more money. And if we're not going  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:40:54):**  to pay more at the checkout, then there needs to be more coming out of taxation, more coming  from government.  And somebody's raking the profits. You know, it's shareholders and offshore tax havens,  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:41:05):**  high executive salaries, all these things. And yet we know food workers are some of the  lowest paid. Farmers struggle. You know, this is not a well-managed system at the moment.  And I think it needs intervention in the short term, if not long term, to make it work.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:41:19):**  I want to broaden the conversation out just for a moment, Vicky, if I may, because there's  been so much focus on farming and land use. It's easy to forget that the food systems  are not just about what happens inside the farm gate itself. So thinking about the food  
**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:41:33):**  system more broadly, once food has left the farm, where do you think the chief challenges  are?  Yes, we're just about to actually release a report in the next few weeks called Beyond  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:41:42):**  the Farm Gate, which is looking precisely at this because we surveyed 500 farmers and  asked them what they thought, whether they like the current market, what the barriers  were to changing it, and that means infrastructure. So it's things like milling, drying, sorting,  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:41:56):**  grading the produce that comes from the farm. And for commodity farmers who produce, you  know, they just let it out the farm gate and don't have much say in what happens to it  next and it could be sold anywhere. Those commodity farmers are, you know, the most  
**[0:42:09-0:42:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:42:09):**  vulnerable, I think, but they have very little control over what happens to their produce  or their meat. And I think that's got to change. We've got to value it better by having the  processing nearer to the farm or within a region and developing regional infrastructure  
**[0:42:23-0:42:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:42:23):**  and supply chains that are really efficient, but efficiency from a broad perspective, not  just purely in terms of the lowest cost denominator selling produce for the food service sector  or for retail processing. So building in those systems which farmers have more control over  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:42:39):**  and farmer focused trading systems. That's key. That's the sort of phrase we're using,  farmer focused, so actually responsive to what farmers need so they know they can do  more rotations, for instance, or use a different breed of cattle because the buyer beyond the  
**[0:42:54-0:42:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:42:54):**  farm gate is responsible, understand and can change, can talk to the customer about why  this is different, why this looks different, why these carrots are maybe smaller or what,  you know, all these kind of things that happen within a farm gate, which is very difficult.  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:43:07):**  And you know, clearly for people like us of our, you know, not giving any secrets away  that we're probably roughly the same age, we're of the same generation and our relationship  with food has, you know, to a large extent been set, but do you think enough is being  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:43:20):**  done with new generations, with younger generations to change that relationship with food and  the land?  That's a really good question. Really good question because I think a lot of people say  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:43:29):**  we need to teach them about nature in schools and I agree, I think we should, but it's got  to be done in the right way and farm visits are all, you know, I know there's fantastic  initiatives by LEAF and Basetime are far more aware of this now, getting farmers into the  
**[0:43:43-0:43:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:43:43):**  schoolroom digitally is a brilliant idea because it makes it real. They can actually see things  and understand things that happen, but it needs to happen through what they see in the  shops as well. So we need to have proper labelling and clear labelling and not, I mean, one thing  
**[0:43:59-0:44:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:43:59):**  we really need to do is to control marketing of foods and control mislabelling and false  claims about what's healthy, what's good for you. There's a whole host of things that I  could be talking here about, marketing junk foods and everything like that, you know,  
**[0:44:13-0:44:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:44:13):**  so it comes from many different areas within government that has to regulate to make that  happen and to change education systems. And I think that does come from also from parents  understanding it better as well.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:44:25):**  And from things like CBB's that still sort of present the idea that a farm is, you know,  this kind of, you know, mixed farmyard where all the animals are smiling and, you know,  it's slightly more honest about the way that agriculture actually looks these days.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:44:39):**  Funnily enough, Jeremy Clarkson has actually educated a lot more people about what farming  is about, how difficult it is, how vulnerable it is to the climate and changes and what  happens. And I think that's all to the good, the more people understand that. And I've  
**[0:44:53-0:44:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:44:53):**  heard people say that. Farmers have said that children understand farming better having  watched Jeremy Clarkson. So that's all to the good, but we need more of it. And, you  know, through the channels that children are actually watching, which often isn't TV, you  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:45:06):**  know, it's often online forums and, you know, there's different channels and we really need  to understand that. As the oldies in the room, we need to understand different ways of communicating  that.  
**[0:45:16-0:45:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:45:16):**  Now, just finally, and so that we don't end the programme feeling too despondent, because,  you know, we talked about a lot of bad stuff as well as, you know, we touched on some of  the good stuff, but there is so much good stuff. What are the things that make you feel  
**[0:45:27-0:45:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:45:27):**  hopeful and that make you feel that we might actually turn things around in time to save  the species, to save the bugs and indeed save the planet?  Yeah, I am. I am hopeful. And actually a couple of years ago I wrote a blog how wonderful  
**[0:45:39-0:45:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:45:39):**  it was to see in the main farming press how much more was covering regenerative agroecological  farming practices, farmers doing things differently and making a living from it, you know, and  actually learning. And so those organs for the industry, you know, are indicators of  
**[0:45:55-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:45:55):**  how things have changed. And I've been to Groundswell and there's Innovate Farmers,  awful lot of good stuff happening. Farmers are learning and farmer to farmer peer learning  is one of the best ways of getting these changes. So I am hopeful. I'm hopeful the elms will  
**[0:46:10-0:46:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:46:10):**  actually be designed in a way with the financial underpinning that actually helps all farmers  do something. So I am hopeful and the public. One of the things I found about investigating  invertebrates was the scientists were saying what we really need is the public to support  
**[0:46:27-0:46:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:46:27):**  us. They actually said we want public support for what we want to do, which is to do to  actually understand what's happening on the ground because so much money goes into  ways to kill the bugs and to eliminate the threat. Whereas we need to live with and share  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:46:41):**  the land and understand the beneficial bugs and the beneficial environment that farmers  need, you know, can make a living in and maybe spending less on input inputs, possibly having  a different yield, but still making a good living. So I am positive there's so much going  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:46:55):**  on out there and farmers can access that information.  And of course, you mentioned regenerative agriculture there. And one of the key principles  of Regen is that connectivity and the allowing of complexity. And that goes back, doesn't  
**[0:47:08-0:47:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:47:08):**  it? Not just when we're talking about the sward and what's there, you know, in the grasses,  but when we're talking about farming and the food system more generally, that there is  a place for the small, the medium, the large, that we need that diversity and we need that  
**[0:47:22-0:47:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Vicki-Hird--Rebugging-The-Planet-e18b49h#t=0:47:22):**  greater connectivity between, you know, the food system and the customers that they're  serving. And hey, let's let's keep fingers crossed for alms. Vicky, that's that's been  fascinating, but that's all we have time for. I'd like to thank my guest, Vicky Heard, head

**[0:00:00-0:00:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:00):**  A few days after recording this podcast, IPES Food members stepped down from roles they  
**[0:00:05-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:05):**  held within the UN Food Systems Summit process. The discussion that follows helps to explain  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:12):**  why.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:14):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finn Loke Steyn, the Chief Executive of Farmwell. This  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:22):**  year's UN Food Systems Summit is being seen by many as an opportunity to define the future  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:27):**  of food. The summit may also be the launchpad for a new science and policy interface modelled  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:32):**  on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:35):**  Now, there's no question that policy-relevant scientific assessment of food systems is important,  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:40):**  but several science policy interfaces already exist, not least the high-level panel of experts  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:45):**  on food security and nutrition that serves the UN Committee on World Food Security.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:50):**  So do we really need an IPCC for food? Shouldn't we simply better fund and better utilise the  
**[0:00:56-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:00:56):**  mechanisms we already have? I'm joined by the authors of an IPES Food report that addresses  
**[0:01:01-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:01):**  these questions and which argues that the Food Systems Summit is part of a broader battle  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:05):**  over what food systems should look like and who should govern them in the future.  
**[0:01:10-0:01:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:10):**  Jennifer Clapp is an expert in global food security and sustainability from the University  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:14):**  of Waterloo in Ontario. She is also part of the UN's high-level panel of experts on food  
**[0:01:19-0:01:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:19):**  security and nutrition and an expert panellist for IPES Food.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:22):**  Molly Anderson is a specialist in hunger, food systems and multi-actor collaborations  
**[0:01:27-0:01:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:27):**  for sustainability for Middlebury College in Vermont, USA. She's especially interested  
**[0:01:32-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:32):**  in food system resilience and human rights in the food system and Molly is also an expert  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:37):**  panellist for IPES Food. Welcome both.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:39):**  Thanks for having us.  
**[0:01:41-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:41):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:42):**  Molly, perhaps the best place to start is with some recent history. Where has the idea  
**[0:01:46-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:46):**  for the UN Food Systems Summit come from and what's it trying to achieve?  
**[0:01:50-0:01:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:50):**  I think we have to go back to 2019 to really understand that. In 2019, the United Nations  
**[0:01:57-0:02:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:01:57):**  signed a strategic partnership with the World Economic Forum, which is made up of the thousand  
**[0:02:02-0:02:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:02):**  largest corporations in the world. Many people looked at this partnership as the real impetus  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:08):**  for the summit and claimed that the summit is simply a continuation of WEF's Global  
**[0:02:14-0:02:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:14):**  Redesign Initiative, which was launched several years ago, and its Great Reset Initiative  
**[0:02:19-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:19):**  to substitute corporate governance for state-led decision-making. Officially, the summit happened  
**[0:02:26-0:02:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:26):**  because the Rome-based agencies, which are the Food and Agriculture Organization, the  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:30):**  International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Programme, got together  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:35):**  with UN headquarters and decided that something different was needed to meet the Sustainable  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:40):**  Development Goals by 2030. In particular, we have seen that the world has been sliding  
**[0:02:47-0:02:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:47):**  backwards on Sustainable Development Goal 2 to end hunger since 2014. And especially  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:02:54):**  with the onslaught of COVID-19 and how wealthy countries are blocking access to a vaccine  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:00):**  that would serve poor countries, hunger has gotten much worse. The latest report of the  
**[0:03:05-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:05):**  state of food security and nutrition in the world was just released, and it said that  
**[0:03:10-0:03:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:10):**  between 720 and 811 million people faced chronic undernourishment in 2020, which was 118 million  
**[0:03:19-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:19):**  more people than in 2019. Now, going back to the objectives for the summit, overall  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:25):**  they're to help us meet the Sustainable Development Goals, but specifically to generate significant  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:31):**  action and measurable progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:36):**  raise awareness and elevate public discussion about how reforming our food systems can help  
**[0:03:42-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:42):**  us to achieve the SDGs, to develop principles to guide governments and other stakeholders  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:49):**  that are looking to leverage their food systems to support the SDGs, and finally to create  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:03:54):**  a system of follow-up and review to ensure that the summit's outcomes continue to drive  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:00):**  new actions and progress.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:01):**  So the way that you framed that, it's about trying to address the SDGs and deliver on  
**[0:04:07-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:07):**  the SDGs, but because of that sort of driver coming from the World Economic Forum, it's  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:12):**  almost as if the way that you seem to be describing it is as if there's almost a corporate land  
**[0:04:16-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:16):**  grab over states over the future of food systems.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:20):**  I think that's fair to say. And the way that the summit is actually rolled out has shown  
**[0:04:26-0:04:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:26):**  that corporate grab over states, and it's been widely criticised because of that.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:32):**  So where's this idea of an IPCC for food come from?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:36):**  Well, it originated a long time back. The first time we saw any mention of an IPCC for  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:42):**  food was in a paper that was published in 2015. But the idea has been picked up and  
**[0:04:48-0:04:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:48):**  embellished and distributed through a powerful network of people who are closely interconnected.  
**[0:04:55-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:04:55):**  It's been repeated over and over. We are sure to see it coming up in the pre-summit in just  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:00):**  a few days. And it has seemed to gain weight the more it's been repeated.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:05):**  Jennifer, I'm interested in why there is concern about the IPCC-type body for food systems.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:13):**  Plenty of people would say that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been a good thing.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:17):**  It's allowed an aggregation of climate science, which is essential if we're to address the  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:21):**  global warming crisis that we face.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:23):**  So why is there this concern about an IPCC-type body for food systems?  
**[0:05:29-0:05:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:29):**  Right, it's a good question. And first, I just want to say that science policy interfaces  
**[0:05:34-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:34):**  are of course very important. And just like it's useful to aggregate climate science to  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:39):**  inform policymaking in that issue area, it's also important to have independent, impartial  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:45):**  and solid evidence backing up food policies, evidence that is viewed as legitimate by all  
**[0:05:49-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:49):**  stakeholders.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:50):**  The issue with the proposal that's likely to be put forward in the Food Systems Summit  
**[0:05:54-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:05:54):**  for a new IPCC for food isn't so much about the idea of having a strong intergovernmental  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:00):**  science policy interface at the global level for food.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:03):**  The concern, rather, is that the articulation of this proposal has been repeated many times,  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:08):**  but it's consistently failed to recognise that there already exists a strong, independent  
**[0:06:13-0:06:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:13):**  intergovernmental science policy interface for food.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:16):**  And that's the high-level panel of experts on food security and nutrition, which we call  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:20):**  the HLPE for short. And the HLPE basically is the science policy interface at the global  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:26):**  level for the Committee on World Food Security. And the Committee on World Food Security is  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:30):**  widely viewed as the most inclusive and legitimate intergovernmental forum for food policy coordination  
**[0:06:35-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:35):**  at the global level.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:36):**  So the concern about introducing a new science policy interface, it just raises a whole bunch  
**[0:06:41-0:06:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:41):**  of concerns. And maybe I'll just briefly mention two areas where there are some concerns. One  
**[0:06:46-0:06:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:46):**  is about the governance landscape for food security and nutrition more broadly.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:49):**  It's not clear whether it's seeking to replace the HLPE, and it's also not clear to which  
**[0:06:54-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:06:54):**  governance body it will provide advice. And these uncertainties raise bigger questions,  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:00):**  such as, is the move really an attempt to displace the Committee on World Food Security,  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:05):**  which is the key global governance body for food policy? Is this a strategic move to change  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:10):**  the governance landscape for food security and nutrition, and potentially replace it  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:15):**  with a new multi-stakeholder approach that privileges the interests of industrial agriculture  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:19):**  rather than the interests of a wider group of stakeholders? And that's a concern because  
**[0:07:23-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:23):**  the CFS, as I mentioned, it's seen as an inclusive and legitimate body. And so is the IPCC for  
**[0:07:29-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:29):**  food proposal trying to displace that body?  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:32):**  And then the second set of concerns focuses really around questions of process that are  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:37):**  likely to be embodied within this proposed panel. And it's really not clear whether this  
**[0:07:43-0:07:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:43):**  proposed IPCC for food would actually be inclusive of stakeholders, including civil society and  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:49):**  the private sector. Earlier proposals cast some doubt on the extent to which that inclusivity  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:07:55):**  would be built into the panel. And also there's nowhere in these proposals have we seen really  
**[0:08:00-0:08:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:00):**  a recognition of the importance of indigenous and traditional knowledge as being relevant  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:05):**  to evidence-based assessments, scientific assessments for food systems. So really there's  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:09):**  these two big concerns about governance landscape more broadly and then process within this  
**[0:08:13-0:08:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:13):**  proposed panel. Those concerns raise the really big question about whose interests will this  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:20):**  new body actually serve. And that's why a number of analysts as well as civil society  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:25):**  actors have been actively campaigning over the past month against this proposal of a  
**[0:08:30-0:08:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:30):**  new IPCC for food. And instead they'd like to see the high-level panel of experts on  
**[0:08:34-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:34):**  food security and nutrition, which is interlinked with the Committee on World Food Security  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:38):**  to be strengthened rather than replaced.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:40):**  World Food Security  
**[0:08:53-0:09:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:08:53):**  in  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:12):**  rights. They are sometimes mandated to make profits if they're a public company, if they're  
**[0:09:17-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:17):**  owned by shareholders. The ways that corporations and technology companies are intervening in the  
**[0:09:24-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:24):**  food system have actually been very damaging. And we could see a continuation of that if they gain  
**[0:09:30-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:30):**  even more power. For instance, they're damaging the environment through producing and selling  
**[0:09:35-0:09:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:35):**  pesticides and synthetic fertilizers and other products and equipment that emit greenhouse gases.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:41):**  They're damaging communities by exploiting or underpaying labor and shortchanging farmers  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:47):**  and fisher people. And they're damaging human health by producing and marketing foodstuffs  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:53):**  that are killing us by making us fat, by giving us diabetes, by giving us other diet-related  
**[0:09:59-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:09:59):**  diseases. Corporations have become increasingly concentrated in every food system activity,  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:05):**  from seed production to food retailing over the last few decades. This has been well documented.  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:10):**  And as their power has grown, they are increasingly trying to influence politics  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:15):**  at the national and international scale, whether that means supporting politicians who are opposed  
**[0:10:21-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:21):**  to regulations that protect the environment and human rights, fighting labels on genetically  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:27):**  modified products, even when the public says that that's what they want, or pushing the US  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:32):**  government to force Mexico to accept imports of Roundup and Roundup Ready seed. That's an issue  
**[0:10:38-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:38):**  that's going on right now. Of course technology has a place in solutions. But technology isn't  
**[0:10:44-0:10:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:44):**  all about GMOs and digitalization, which is the kinds of things that the corporations that are  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:51):**  involved in the Food System Summit seem to be interested in. Technology that saves people from  
**[0:10:56-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:10:56):**  drudgery, that's widely accessible, and that's owned by people is a very good thing. But when  
**[0:11:02-0:11:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:02):**  the technology is owned and controlled by a corporation, and when it squeezes out more  
**[0:11:08-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:08):**  affordable and accessible options, that's not good at all. For instance, in the United States,  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:13):**  John Deere tractors that farmers aren't allowed to fix when they break, but they have to pay a  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:19):**  licensed dealer to do the repairs, that's not a good thing at all. Corporations are generally  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:25):**  striving for efficiency, so they might be able to deliver change faster. But if it's not the  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:30):**  change that people want that addresses people's needs, it's not worth much. If the change is just  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:36):**  something that allows the corporation to make more of a profit, yet often it's building on research  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:41):**  that's done at the public expense, then people are going to resist it. And that's what we're  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:46):**  seeing with the summit. So is it perhaps less to do with the technology itself, more about  
**[0:11:51-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:51):**  the corporations or the patent holding for that technology and how corporations wield power  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:11:57):**  associated with that technology? Exactly. And we're seeing them moving into this governance  
**[0:12:03-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:03):**  space more and more, which is why control by interests that are supporting corporations  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:11):**  is of such concern in this new proposal for a science policy interface. Jennifer, you're a  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:17):**  member of the UN's high level panel of experts on food security and nutrition. I wonder if you  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:22):**  could tell us a little bit more about how the HLPE works and where there might be some room  
**[0:12:27-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:27):**  for improvement. The HLPE, I should stress, is just one of a number of science policy interfaces  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:33):**  that address food systems and food insecurity at the international level. But as you said,  
**[0:12:37-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:37):**  it's the main intergovernmental science policy interface, which means it directly interfaces  
**[0:12:43-0:12:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:43):**  with an intergovernmental governance body in the Committee on World Food Security, which is a UN  
**[0:12:48-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:48):**  committee. And the HLPE responds to requests from the Committee on World Food Security for  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:54):**  scientific assessment on key questions, and it also undertakes assessment on critical and  
**[0:12:58-0:13:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:12:58):**  emerging issues. So really, the body serves as a ready expert panel that can provide that kind of  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:05):**  policy advice that's based in credible scientific evidence through its kind of assessment process.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:11):**  And the way that the HLPE goes about that assessment process is highly transparent and  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:16):**  inclusive. It involves stakeholders throughout the entire process. Stakeholders are openly  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:21):**  consulted at the scoping process as we're defining how we're going to approach particular topics.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:27):**  They're also participating as we do surveys on what are the most important critical and  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:32):**  emerging issues out there. And then stakeholders are also invited at various stages of the drafting  
**[0:13:36-0:13:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:36):**  process of the reports, from the zero draft to the first draft. And drafts also undergo rigorous  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:41):**  scientific peer review as well before they're published. Throughout this process, the HLPE  
**[0:13:46-0:13:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:46):**  really strives to take an even-handed approach when it comes to controversial issues. So for  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:51):**  example, with respect to agricultural trade or new technologies like gene editing, for example,  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:13:56):**  and tries to present policymakers with a full picture of the nature of any disputes  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:01):**  and the various sources of evidence on different sides of an issue so that policymakers can make  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:05):**  better decisions. And the HLPE also takes effort to incorporate and welcome different kinds of  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:11):**  knowledge into that assessment process, including indigenous, traditional, and farmer knowledge.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:15):**  And this is important because, especially in the area of food and agriculture, where farmers have  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:22):**  been the primary and indigenous peoples have been the primary innovators for over 10,000 years,  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:28):**  for us to not take that knowledge and information into account would be problematic. So we really  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:35):**  try to do that. And there isn't a kind of hierarchy in there in terms of where that information is  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:40):**  coming from. You don't look at information that comes out of, I don't know, for example,  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:44):**  Oxford University and say that's more important than information that's coming from an indigenous  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:49):**  community. We take all information and knowledge that we can, and it's not like there's a specific  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:14:55):**  hierarchy because in many ways, the only way we will get some of that information that's  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:02):**  knowledge based on indigenous knowledge and traditional and farmer knowledge is going to  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:06):**  come from our consultation processes. And it's not going to be published in peer-reviewed  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:10):**  scientific journals. So we really need to take all of that knowledge into account.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:14):**  And what about the improvements, Jennifer? Is there room for improvement?  
**[0:15:18-0:15:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:18):**  Yes, of course. I mean, as with any organization, there's always room for improvement. And the HLP  
**[0:15:23-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:23):**  has constantly been thinking about and working towards ways to improve what we do.  
**[0:15:27-0:15:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:27):**  One of the areas, for example, is that the HLP is set up and mandated to respond to requests from  
**[0:15:34-0:15:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:34):**  the Committee on World Food Security in terms of what topics it focuses on for its assessment  
**[0:15:39-0:15:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:39):**  reports. So that setup makes it a bit awkward for us to undertake our own assessment initiatives.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:45):**  And a key example of that is the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on food security,  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:50):**  as Molly mentioned. It was difficult for us to just say, oh, we're going to write a report on  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:15:54):**  COVID-19 and food security, but we did do it. We worked with the CFS to facilitate that request  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:01):**  for us to do that work because it was urgent and important. And so one of the areas we'd like to  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:05):**  improve upon is to give us more freedom and scope to do that sort of thing when emergencies like  
**[0:16:10-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:10):**  pandemics come up. And we'd also like to be able to do more work in terms of monitoring the policy  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:16):**  uptake of Committee on World Food Security recommendations to its members. So the way  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:20):**  it works is that the HLPE provides recommendations to the Committee on World Food Security for their  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:26):**  consideration. And oftentimes those recommendations then get discussed in the CFS and then they become  
**[0:16:32-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:32):**  CFS recommendations to its own members. But it's been difficult to monitor how many countries have  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:38):**  taken up those policy recommendations, what kind of experience have they had. And a lot of this  
**[0:16:43-0:16:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:43):**  has to do with basically the resources available to collect that kind of information. But we'd  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:47):**  really like to be able to do that. And we're also very open to doing more database assessments. In  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:53):**  fact, we're undertaking a report right now on data needs and challenges in food security and  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:16:57):**  nutrition. So those are some areas I think that could be improved upon. But some of the reasons  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:01):**  that that's been difficult for us is because we operate on a very small budget. We operate on  
**[0:17:06-0:17:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:06):**  voluntary contributions from government members of the Committee on World Food Security. And so,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:11):**  obviously, a bigger budget would allow us to do some of the things that those, you know,  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:16):**  those promoting this idea of an IPCC for food, they've got really big agenda that they want to  
**[0:17:22-0:17:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:22):**  see. They want to see modelling and analysis and all of this kind of stuff. But that requires a big  
**[0:17:26-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:26):**  budget. So if this new body is set up, that could actually drain resources away from the existing  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:30):**  processes. And from the perspective of the HLPE, we think it would be a more effective use of  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:36):**  resources to bolster what the HLPE is doing and bring on some of those issues that maybe the  
**[0:17:41-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:41):**  proponents of an IPCC for food would like to see, like more data-based assessments. Because  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:47):**  otherwise, it risks fragmenting global food security governance exactly at the moment when  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:52):**  the pandemic is raging, hunger is rising, etc. It seems it would make more sense to not reinvent the  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:17:58):**  wheel but to strengthen it instead. One of the problems I've noticed with the IPCC, you know,  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:03):**  in the time that I've been working around the climate science community is that it delegates  
**[0:18:07-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:07):**  responsibility. It aggregates science, but then it leaves it to the UNFCCC to come up with policy,  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:13):**  even when member states are actively looking to the IPCC for advice and guidance. It sounds,  
**[0:18:17-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:17):**  from what you're saying, as though the HLPE on food security and nutrition  
**[0:18:21-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:21):**  is more actively involved in policy questions. Well, the HLPE definitely is geared towards  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:28):**  providing policy recommendations for members of the Committee on World Food Security.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:33):**  But it is important to stress that science policy interfaces their job is really to provide those  
**[0:18:38-0:18:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:38):**  policy recommendations based on scientific evidence and to policymakers who are typically  
**[0:18:42-0:18:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:42):**  governments. So we do, you know, just as the IPCC serves the UN Framework Convention on Climate  
**[0:18:48-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:48):**  Change, the HLPE serves the Committee on World Food Security in that way. But it is ultimately  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:54):**  up to governments to make policy. And yes, it's frustrating that politics and economic interests  
**[0:18:59-0:19:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:18:59):**  often get into the way, but it's ultimately up to governments to take those decisions.  
**[0:19:03-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:03):**  If I could add, after the HLPE comes out with its policy recommendations, then there's a long  
**[0:19:10-0:19:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:10):**  drawn-out negotiation process where member states decide whether they are going to accept those  
**[0:19:16-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:16):**  policy recommendations. And frequently they don't. So science policy interfaces have limited powers.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:24):**  They can make the very best policy recommendations, but if a government doesn't pick them up, then  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:31):**  you're left with the problem. And if you've got a long drawn-out process while governments are  
**[0:19:35-0:19:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:35):**  discussing it, then, you know, potentially the science could have changed in the interim.  
**[0:19:38-0:19:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:38):**  Molly, let's interrogate this issue of technology just a little more. I'm interested in the way that  
**[0:19:43-0:19:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:43):**  tech is seen as the solution to everything. For example, in tackling climate change,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:48):**  governments put a lot of faith in future techno fixes, but the same seems to be true with food  
**[0:19:53-0:19:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:53):**  systems. Instead of adopting solutions like agroecology, people seem to want to get rid of  
**[0:19:58-0:20:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:19:58):**  livestock and grow meat in petri dishes. Why is that? Why are technical fixes so attractive?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:03):**  Well, what you said about how it's a way to postpone real decisions about the underlying  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:10):**  problems, that's part of it. But another issue is that technical fixes promise to fix a complex  
**[0:20:17-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:17):**  problem in a very simple way. The food system is complex. The issues and the challenges in the  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:23):**  food system are complex. They really don't lend themselves to simple solutions or to  
**[0:20:29-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:29):**  silver bullets like techno fixes. For a policymaker, growing meat in petri dishes  
**[0:20:34-0:20:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:34):**  may sound much easier than regulating the livestock industry. We can have our beef.  
**[0:20:39-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:39):**  We can also have a clean environment. And we don't have to lock horns with the livestock industry.  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:45):**  But the problem is that these techno fixes won't address the underlying problems of inequity,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:51):**  of power imbalances, of unchecked greed, of colonisation, of pollution, the kinds of issues  
**[0:20:58-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:20:58):**  that are really underneath these big food systems problems. Just to take that example a step  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:04):**  further, if you're growing meat in petri dishes, then these patents are going to be, again, owned  
**[0:21:09-0:21:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:09):**  by companies that are then becoming very powerful, rather than having millions of small scale farmers  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:15):**  around the world earning their livelihoods from producing the food that everyone eats.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:20):**  So again, it's about moving that power away from people and into the hands of corporations,  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:25):**  which is the challenge that we keep talking about throughout this podcast.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:28):**  That's right.  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:29):**  Clearly, we need a widespread transition from industrialised and intensive models of  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:34):**  agriculture to agro-ecological systems. But do you think the chief barriers in that transition  
**[0:21:39-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:39):**  are systemic or psychological? And how do we overcome them?  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:43):**  It's a funny way to put it, Philo, because I would say that any systemic problem is also  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:49):**  psychological in that there tends to be a narrative that supports the one size fits all  
**[0:21:56-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:21:56):**  solutions that are proposed for systemic problems. EPAS Food actually did a study back in 2016  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:04):**  from uniformity to diversity that identified eight different lock-ins. And I would add a night.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:11):**  I think we need to revisit that study. And the lock-ins that we identified at that point were  
**[0:22:17-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:17):**  things like path dependency. Whole societies get started along one path and then people are  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:23):**  invested in that path. The researchers are invested. The farmers are invested. The capital  
**[0:22:29-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:29):**  is tied up in certain kinds of infrastructure. So that's one lock-in. Export orientation  
**[0:22:35-0:22:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:35):**  is a second one. The expectation of cheap food, which you might say is a psychological problem,  
**[0:22:41-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:41):**  but it also gets tied in with systemic solutions that provide that cheap food,  
**[0:22:47-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:47):**  whether they're subsidies to the companies that can provide chicken at a really low price or  
**[0:22:54-0:23:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:22:54):**  permission to the meatpacking companies to keep workers on the line, even during COVID.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:01):**  That's all serving this expectation of cheap food. Compartmentalized thinking among policy makers,  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:08):**  short-term thinking among policy makers. They're looking forward to the next election and not  
**[0:23:13-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:13):**  looking to real long-term solutions. The feed the world narrative, which has served a lot of the big  
**[0:23:21-0:23:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:21):**  grain distribution companies, the big corporations that are involved in moving food around the world,  
**[0:23:29-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:29):**  it's this expectation that the industrialized world is going to be feeding the poor world  
**[0:23:35-0:23:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:35):**  instead of allowing and enabling the poorer countries of the world to feed themselves.  
**[0:23:41-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:41):**  And then the measures of success that we use. And finally, all of these things serving this  
**[0:23:47-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:47):**  concentration of power in corporations. And the ninth lock-in that I would add is money.  
**[0:23:54-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:54):**  The companies that have been getting a lot of money out of the food system want to continue  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:23:59):**  getting a lot of money from the food system. And they're not open to the kinds of solutions that  
**[0:24:05-0:24:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:05):**  would disrupt the power relations that we have right now. It's such an enormous challenge,  
**[0:24:10-0:24:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:10):**  isn't it? Because as you say, these things are connected. You've got money and systems and  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:15):**  functionality, contracts, the psychology of whether people feel able to change.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:19):**  Jennifer, it strikes me that governments also have a fixation with funding inputs. And that part of  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:24):**  the challenge is that we need to move to a system where we focus much more on outcomes. For example,  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:30):**  quality nutrition improves soil health and good water management rather than simply paying to  
**[0:24:35-0:24:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:35):**  stick a fence in or stick a pond or a hedge in, which may or may not deliver the outcome that we  
**[0:24:39-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:39):**  want to see. So how do you think we can change that paradigm, especially when the things that  
**[0:24:44-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:44):**  we know, in inverted commas, about how to manage land well from indigenous cultures or the experience  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:50):**  of agroecological farmers aren't always well researched or codified by the scientific community?  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:24:55):**  Because it's only relatively recently that we started asking better questions about our  
**[0:25:00-0:25:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:00):**  food systems. You're exactly right that indigenous peoples and agroecological farmers have a wealth  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:04):**  of knowledge to bring to our understanding of how food systems can be made more sustainable.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:09):**  And not just ecologically, but also socially in terms of their provision of equitable livelihoods.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:15):**  Yet at the same time, there's far less research funding that goes into these areas to learn the  
**[0:25:21-0:25:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:21):**  lessons from traditional and agroecological farming compared to research, for example,  
**[0:25:26-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:26):**  in high tech initiatives like gene editing and digital farming and other technologies that  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:30):**  support an agricultural industrial model. Part of the reason for this is the fact that public  
**[0:25:35-0:25:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:35):**  research, which really should go towards public goods, such as improving our knowledge about  
**[0:25:40-0:25:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:40):**  making food systems more sustainable, that public research funding has been diminishing  
**[0:25:45-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:45):**  over in recent decades, while at the same time privately funded agricultural research has been  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:50):**  on the rise in recent decades. So this kind of shift in research funding and availability and  
**[0:25:55-0:26:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:25:55):**  how much public research is being undertaken has really shifted the balance in terms of the kinds  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:00):**  of research questions that tend to get asked and end up in the scientific literature. So definitely  
**[0:26:06-0:26:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:06):**  I would say that more public funding really needs to go toward research into agroecological farming  
**[0:26:12-0:26:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:12):**  systems and indigenous food systems so that we can learn lessons for sustainability rather than  
**[0:26:18-0:26:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:18):**  focusing on these sort of industrial kinds of models. There seems to be a challenge. There's  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:23):**  much greater scrutiny than perhaps ever before on government treasuries, and it's very difficult for  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:29):**  governments to step out of that sort of accountancy model that they've got themselves into, where they  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:33):**  have to justify every single cent or penny that's spent and move into some of these areas where,  
**[0:26:39-0:26:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:39):**  when you're focused on outcomes, you're not paying for specifics to be put on the land.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:44):**  You're funding farmers to deliver something which is slightly more nebulous,  
**[0:26:48-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:48):**  and that must be a real challenge for governments. It is, and often the metrics of success are not  
**[0:26:55-0:27:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:26:55):**  there. For instance, with carbon sequestration in soil, it's really hard to measure how much carbon  
**[0:27:01-0:27:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:01):**  is in that soil and for how long it is going to be sequestered. We know that once the soil is  
**[0:27:07-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:07):**  disturbed, the carbon will be released again. Yet there's all this talk about paying farmers to  
**[0:27:14-0:27:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:14):**  put carbon into soil without really understanding what's involved there, how long it's going to  
**[0:27:21-0:27:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:21):**  last, how good a solution it is, which soils it works in. So we don't have enough data in that  
**[0:27:29-0:27:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:29):**  case to really be able to go by the outcomes. And if we take that as an example, then perhaps  
**[0:27:35-0:27:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:35):**  rather than trying simply to deliver a single outcome, we need to combine outcomes together  
**[0:27:40-0:27:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:40):**  because we know that good soil health is the foundation of food and it's the foundation of  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:44):**  adaptation of safety in the face of climate change. It can prevent flooding. So carbon,  
**[0:27:49-0:27:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:49):**  perhaps, is one of the outcomes, but an increase in organic matter would be another. Infiltration  
**[0:27:54-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:54):**  rates, that sort of thing. So you're combining these outcomes focused around soil health rather  
**[0:27:59-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:27:59):**  than just getting two wrapped up in one individual outcome. And that's exactly why agroecology is  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:04):**  such an appealing systemic solution, that it has so many positive outcomes. The report that was  
**[0:28:11-0:28:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:11):**  done by the HLPE in 2019 on agroecological and other innovation showed that very clearly. When  
**[0:28:18-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:18):**  you compare agroecology to things like sustainable intensification or climate smart agriculture or  
**[0:28:25-0:28:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:25):**  precision agriculture, you get so many more benefits from agroecology. You get decent  
**[0:28:32-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:32):**  livelihoods, you get better nutrition, you get soil health. And I agree with you, Finlow,  
**[0:28:38-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:38):**  so much comes down to soil health. We're beginning to understand that and the science on soil health.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:44):**  And what that actually means is rapidly burgeoning. But agroecology can provide that,  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:51):**  but also provide all these other benefits. I want to talk about the idea that food is something  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:28:57):**  that everybody should have access to, regardless of whether the process of producing that food is  
**[0:29:02-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:02):**  owned by a corporation or produced by a small-scale smallholder in a country that's relatively  
**[0:29:09-0:29:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:09):**  powerless in international terms. Now, you've said that food should be considered a human right,  
**[0:29:14-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:14):**  Molly, and it's clearly not. It's seen as a commodity, a profit centre. How do we change that?  
**[0:29:20-0:29:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:20):**  People who are working in civil society and UN organisations have put a lot of time into that  
**[0:29:27-0:29:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:27):**  question, Finlow, since food was first recognised as a human right in the 1948 Universal Declaration  
**[0:29:33-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:33):**  of Human Rights. What that means for food to be a human right has been clarified in many different  
**[0:29:41-0:29:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:41):**  documents since the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 2004, the Right to Food guidelines  
**[0:29:48-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:48):**  were adopted by the FAO, and these are formally known as Voluntary Guidelines on the Progressive  
**[0:29:54-0:30:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:29:54):**  Realisation of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Security. These explain in  
**[0:30:00-0:30:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:00):**  detail what a state needs to do to move toward respecting, protecting and fulfilling the right  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:06):**  to food. So it's very clear, it's all laid out, and there are great examples around the world of  
**[0:30:13-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:13):**  how countries have implemented food as a human right. We've seen that even countries with  
**[0:30:20-0:30:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:20):**  relatively few resources, poor countries, can have better food security than wealthy countries when  
**[0:30:27-0:30:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:27):**  they recognise the right to food. Brazil was an outstanding example. It was an early adopter of  
**[0:30:33-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:33):**  many different policies that brought food into being a human right instead of simply a commodity.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:41):**  And some of those policies have been eroded under the current administration in Brazil, but some of  
**[0:30:47-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:47):**  them have stayed in place because people in Brazil know that food is one of their human rights, and  
**[0:30:53-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:30:53):**  they refuse to accept that right being taken away. It was a whole package of policies, things like  
**[0:31:01-0:31:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:01):**  ensuring that every child in school had a nutritious, healthy lunch every day, ensuring  
**[0:31:09-0:31:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:09):**  that farmers who were poor themselves were able to provide the food to those schools to make those  
**[0:31:17-0:31:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:17):**  healthy lunches, ensuring that poor farmers had access to good markets in cities, ensuring that  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:24):**  there are places in cities where anyone could go and get a good lunch at a low price. So it was a  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:32):**  whole package of policies. One of the most effective was providing a cash payment to  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:38):**  families that were low income so that they could buy the food that they wanted and needed,  
**[0:31:44-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:44):**  not providing a food box, but a cash payment so that they had control over the food that they  
**[0:31:49-0:31:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:49):**  were buying. So there was a whole sort of national strategy to deliver that directive of food  
**[0:31:56-0:32:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:31:56):**  security and food as a human right. Exactly. The CFS has a similar prism. Everything has to be  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:02):**  considered through the right to food. The right to food must be the basis of all the policies that  
**[0:32:08-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:08):**  are enacted or that are served up in guidelines or recommendations of the Committee on World  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:15):**  Food Security. Jennifer, we're talking about science and policy in the way that it interfaces  
**[0:32:20-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:20):**  today, but let's go back to science for a moment. There's an idea, I think, in society at large,  
**[0:32:26-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:26):**  and I keep hearing this from broadcast journalists, for example, in one way or another, that somehow  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:32):**  science is benign. But the science community is just as rife with ego and politics and competition  
**[0:32:37-0:32:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:37):**  as any other sector. And often, whether your research makes an impact or not, it's down to  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:41):**  personality, connections or even communications budget. So in your view, how should policymakers  
**[0:32:47-0:32:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:47):**  interact with science to ensure that they're making better decisions based on the best  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:52):**  available information? Yes, well, Finlow, you're right that many people do think of science as  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:32:57):**  being intrinsically objective and holding the truth, in air quotes, which gives it weight and  
**[0:33:03-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:03):**  legitimacy. But a lot of work has to go into science to enable it to live up to that reputation,  
**[0:33:09-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:09):**  and that includes rigorous scientific review processes and other ways to verify knowledge.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:16):**  But you're absolutely right that politics, egos and economic interests can definitely  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:21):**  infiltrate the process. And I would argue that that's why transparency and inclusivity are so  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:27):**  important in the scientific assessment process that's geared towards policymakers, so that if  
**[0:33:33-0:33:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:33):**  politics and interests do start to influence the scientific process, it will become evident and the  
**[0:33:39-0:33:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:39):**  course can be corrected. Because we don't want to be anti-science, but we need to recognize that  
**[0:33:44-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:44):**  science itself can be subject to conflicts of interest. So the knowledge that informs  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:50):**  policymakers, it really needs to be credible to be legitimate. But at the same time, the process  
**[0:33:55-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:33:55):**  of assessment of that knowledge on any given topic, it has to be legitimate in order for the  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:00):**  information to be credible. So I know they're sort of tightly linked there, but the process  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:05):**  has to be open and transparent to give it that legitimacy, which in turn gives it that credibility.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:11):**  Thank you. We're coming to the end of the program. And Molly, I want to give you a magic wand.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:16):**  If you could change one thing about the Food Systems Summit and its processes,  
**[0:34:20-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:20):**  what would it be? That's a big question. The one thing I would love to see is for the organizers  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:27):**  of the summit to say, we made some big mistakes and we want to start over. We understand now  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:33):**  that given the way we set the summit up, it could never be a people summit, which was what we kept  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:39):**  trying to call it over and over. We want to start over with the people who haven't been well served  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:46):**  by food systems, the people who are hungry, whose land has been stolen, whose rights have been abused  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:34:52):**  and violated. And we want to convene consultations with them in which they have the ability to design  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:00):**  the summit, the ability to design their own solutions to their problems and to produce  
**[0:35:05-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:05):**  their own food and to have control over their food systems. We'll start by going to the places  
**[0:35:11-0:35:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:11):**  where social movements already come together, such as the Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples  
**[0:35:17-0:35:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:17):**  Mechanism of the Committee on World Food Security, which brings together 380 million representatives  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:23):**  of people's organizations and which, by the way, refused to participate in the food summit because  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:29):**  they didn't see it as being legitimate. Then we'll try to figure out how to finance and how to  
**[0:35:35-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:35):**  actually implement these ideas that come from the poorest people, understanding that SDG 2 can only  
**[0:35:42-0:35:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:42):**  be met if poor people design the solutions and have agency and control over their own food  
**[0:35:49-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:49):**  systems, what's been called food sovereignty. The summit is unlikely to solve the problems in the  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:35:55):**  food system because its organizers aren't looking at the root causes of power inequities, excessive  
**[0:36:01-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:01):**  corporate control, racism, colonization, exploitation. So we want to start over and we'll  
**[0:36:07-0:36:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:07):**  go back to the poorest people for the solutions. Will Barron So you want to take it down,  
**[0:36:12-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:12):**  go back to scratch and instead of having a food system summit which is designed by those who are  
**[0:36:18-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:18):**  already winning in the food system that we have, actually start designing it from the bottom up  
**[0:36:24-0:36:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:24):**  from those people who are currently losing out. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Well, if that was a  
**[0:36:28-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:28):**  big question, here's a bigger question, Jennifer, because just finally, I'm going to pass that magic  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:32):**  wand to you and gloriously, I'm going to give you greater powers. So if you could use the wand to  
**[0:36:37-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:37):**  change just one thing about the global food system as it stands today, but only one thing,  
**[0:36:43-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:43):**  what would you change? Jennifer  
**[0:36:51-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:51):**  Wow, that's a really tough question because there are so many aspects of the food system that do  
**[0:36:53-0:36:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:53):**  need changing, but I'll draw on my own expertise and research.  
**[0:36:53-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:53):**  Will Barron Yeah, I'm a mean genie, I'm just giving you one wish.  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:36:55):**  Jennifer Yeah, well, Molly and I are a bit tricky with our wishes because we try to pick the things  
**[0:37:00-0:37:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:00):**  that will change multiple things. But for my own research, I focus on corporate power in the food  
**[0:37:06-0:37:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:06):**  system. And I would say that concentrated power in the hands of few corporate powerful actors really  
**[0:37:12-0:37:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:12):**  breeds inequities in food systems that are at the root of so many problems. And so for me, if I  
**[0:37:17-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:17):**  could wave that magic wand, I would like to really rein in that corporate power and make food systems  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:23):**  more equitable so that the hundreds of millions of small scale farmers and food system workers  
**[0:37:28-0:37:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:28):**  who are currently disadvantaged in the dominant industrial food system so that they can exercise  
**[0:37:33-0:37:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:33):**  what is their rightful agency and voice to shape food systems to basically meet their own needs  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:39):**  and secure their own livelihoods and to make food systems more sustainable. If we have that kind of  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:44):**  equity and give people the agency and the right to do so, that will really make a big difference  
**[0:37:50-0:37:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:50):**  in terms of shaping food systems to be more sustainable and equitable.  
**[0:37:53-0:37:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Do-we-need-an-IPCC-for-food-e15bgh9#t=0:37:53):**  Will Barron That's fantastic. It's been so interesting to spend that time with you. You

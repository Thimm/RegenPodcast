**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Fenlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  of the Food and Global Security Network.  The way land is managed has a fundamental impact on our ability not only to mitigate  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:17):**  climate change by actively reducing the prevalence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but  to help society adapt to the impacts of global warming. Farming and food production are central  to this conversation.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:29):**  Many of us automatically associate extreme heat waves with global warming, but increased  rainfall and storm intensity are also hugely important characteristics of global temperature  rises. These changes in precipitation require that we learn and deploy different land and  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:44):**  habitat management techniques. For example, soil must be regenerated so that it can absorb  water that arrives in deluges and store it to support food production even during long,  dry periods.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:55):**  But we also need farmers and other landowners to manage excess water flows so that communities  downstream are protected from flooding and the enormous cost, disruption and pain that  that can bring.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:07):**  In this programme, we're talking about natural flood defences and ways to manage water in  the landscape. Chris Utley is the Stroud Valley's Natural Flood Management Officer for Stroud  District Council. And Tom Johnstone is the Strategic Climate Change, Green Infrastructure  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:21):**  and Catchments Officer for the Cluidian Range and D Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  Welcome both.  Hi, Finn Lowe.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:28):**  Hi, thank you very much for having me.  Chris, before we get into the details about particular projects, could we start by just  outlining what we mean by natural flood defences? For example, what sort of interventions are  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:39):**  we talking about?  There's a lot of mysteriousness about what we're actually talking about here, but we're  looking at the whole catchment approach to managing flows. We're looking at and trying  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:50):**  to understand how water moves through the landscape and then thinking about different  natural flood management interventions or different interventions designed for different  parts of that. So we want to try and intervene in all parts of the hydrograph. A hydrograph  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:04):**  is basically just a description of the way that the rainfall falls and then gets intercepted  by plants. And then it starts to flow across the land. Some of it's transported by trees  into the air and some of it soaks into the soil. And then the stuff that's left after  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:20):**  it's gone back up into the air and into the soil flows across land. And so we're looking  at surface flow routes, creating rougher forms of vegetation to slow that surface flow down,  or looking at opportunities for small scale intervention. And the way we do that is by  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:36):**  managing or manipulating habitats and vegetation, looking at how we farm and how soils are managed,  or by looking at changing the physical shape of the land or the streams. So adding trees  to streams is a very popular intervention because they don't interfere with the main  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:53):**  business of the farm itself. But we can also re-naturalise streams that have kind of been  put into ditches and moved over to sides of the field. We can create low earth buttons  and grasslands across surface flow pathways. I guess the only other thing I'd add is that  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:07):**  natural is a bit of a misleading term because in many cases, this isn't just leaving things  to nature. It's highly interventionist. It takes a great deal of effort to put in place  so-called natural flood defences. If we compare it to what happens in a kind of contemporary  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:22):**  engineered scheme, most of the flood management that we see around us is designed to intervene  just in one part of that hydrograph. So that's high flows on main rivers. I think our approach  is about looking at the whole of the system from the top, from the rainfall, right through  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:38):**  to those kind of big flows and rivers, seeing if there's opportunities to intervene in all  parts of that sort of system.  Jason Vale And when you say that natural is almost a  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:47):**  misnomer, the reality is that the whole of our landscape, the whole of our farmed landscape  anyway, is unnatural. It's been managed and created over centuries by human beings. But  what we're talking about is the use of nature, the changing of nature, rather than the imposition  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:04):**  of lots of metal and concrete.  Ian Marber No, that's fair enough. So it's basically  understanding the practical application of geography. Leaky dams are now, I guess, have  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:15):**  almost become synonymous with the approach, partly because to put it kind of bluntly,  they're easy to do. I mean, for our type of project, they're relatively straightforward,  partly because if you think about the sort of farmed landscape, and you've got the factory  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:29):**  floor of the farm in the fields, most leaky dams can easily be deployed in the kind of  what are called the non-food producing areas of the farm. So within the streams and within  ditches. So they're often a kind of go to first thing because they're a physical manifestation  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:46):**  of what we're trying to do. And they're acceptable to the farmer or the landowner.  Jason Vale Chris, Stroud's approach to natural flood  defence has been held up as a nationwide exemplar. What happened to make Stroud take this issue  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:58):**  so seriously?  Chris  Well, in a nutshell, major flooding happened in 2007. Like a lot of the country, the Stroud  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:06):**  valleys were hit by those extreme storm events during the summer. Like lots of places, there's  a pattern, a historical pattern of flooding that stretches back into the memories of people  in the town. But 2007 was really the kind of foundational flood event. But flooding  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:22):**  creates a lot of anger amongst communities. It's intensely political. And when you've  got an area like Stroud, lots of different parts of Stroud flooded, the people who live  there become mobilised, they want something done. And they're also curious about what  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:38):**  they can do to resolve it. And flooding in rural areas, and particularly, you know, I'm  talking market towns, villages, is very different to the sort of flooding you might get in an  urban area, because the pattern of settlements are just different. So you know, there isn't  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:53):**  one big housing estate which gets clobbered, it's spread out down the whole of the river  system. So no one big thing will prevent it from occurring. And if there is a big thing,  then only a small number of properties will benefit. So it makes it much less likely that  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:07):**  it will get funded. So after 2007, and bear in mind, this is kind of summarising years  of work, the environment agency and the Stroud authorities looked at a large storage area  in the Slag Valley. But this just wasn't feasible, because the geology, you know, this area's  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:22):**  got lots of clay, it's got lots of areas of what's called full as earth. So talcum powder,  and building large amounts of concrete and storing 1000s of tonnes of water on talcum  powder, as I'm sure you could appreciate isn't a wise idea. We've also got lots of historic  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:39):**  infrastructure that's difficult to unpick. We've got culverts under houses, culverts  under our bus station, there's a cinema on top of the slag brook. So unpicking all that  is incredibly difficult. And the residents eventually realised that there was a new way  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:56):**  of looking at foot risk called Natural Foot Management, taking this whole system approach.  And it was really down to them, they lobbied incredibly hard to get the funding for what  was quite an experimental approach at the time. So we spent eight years basically trying  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:10):**  to work with as many landowners as possible to allow us to create this variety of features  on their land that slow flows and benefit nature. The real innovation, though, was to  put this job into the local authority.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:20):**  I'm going to go into some of the detail around what's happened in the Slad Valley a bit later  in the programme, but I'm really interested in the word anger, because it's not a word  that I would necessarily instantly associate with flooding. I mean, there were lots and  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:33):**  lots of emotions I can imagine being brought up. But anger is, is something quite specific.  And what was it that people were angry about? Who was that anger targeted at?  The anger is generally unfocused, but targeted at them. So I think we, you know, we live  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:52):**  in a sort of society and world where we generally think we're in control. And we generally feel  that, you know, we're an advanced developed society, and we control everything. We control  our rivers, we control our land, we control our air. And flooding makes you realise that  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:07):**  actually, we are powerless in some circumstances. And when you feel powerlessness, then someone  has to be at fault. You know, something's gone wrong in the system, surely something  has been worked out in the past to stop us from being flooded. And I think that kind  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:22):**  of searching for someone who will be responsible creates that anger. And I've met and talked  with lots of people who've been flooded. And that initial burst of powerlessness and anger  is very common, I think, amongst flooded communities. And working through that and kind of harnessing  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:41):**  that in some ways to generate solutions to the problem can lead to a project such as  the one within Stroud, or it can obviously lead to other places that you know, where  there isn't such a good connection between what's happening on the land and the town.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:56):**  So a more fractured community.  I think that's absolutely fascinating. And I think it's a salient message, really a wake  up call for other local authorities and other places around the world. When we know that  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:08):**  climate change is having the effects, the impacts that it's having, that if people aren't  planning, if local governments, authorities of one kind or another aren't taking steps  to intervene and make sure that these big flood events are better managed in the future,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:24):**  then that anger will become only more palpable in the future. That's really interesting.  Now, Tom, you've been sitting there very patiently. Let me come to you now. You've recently delivered  a report for the Cluidian Range in Dee Valley AONB called Landscape and Nature Recovery  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:39):**  in a Changing Climate. What's the report setting out to achieve and what stage are  you at in terms of delivery?  So the report is a collaborative piece of work between the AONB team and Natural Resources  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:50):**  Wales aiming to take a landscape view of the risks that climate change poses to the protected  landscapes and the surrounding area, offering a range of mitigations and adaptations that  may be suitable in addressing those risks and offers visualisations of potential future  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:07):**  landscapes that may be more resilient, manage water better and protect the livelihoods of  those who live, work and visit the AONB. The guide has been developed to be a catalyst  for conversations and change, and it's already proving successful in that. And we're driving  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:22):**  the conversation forward with the landscape scale for you, which we feel is essential  to creating economically and ecologically resilient countryside. And since its launch,  I've been almost entirely focused on getting the guide into the hands of farmers so I can  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:37):**  listen to their challenges, their worries, concerns, vision for the future and their  attitudes and views towards implementing some of the suggestions that we make.  A lot of the connections that I've made within the farming community have come through word  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:49):**  of mouth. So it's really been meeting a farmer who has read the guide and been interested  or engaged by it. And then they've sent me off to speak to their neighbour or speak to  another farmer. What I'm really trying to do now is to try and find a broader church  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:03):**  of farmers to go and speak to.  Tom, the report splits the Cluidian Range and Dee Valley area into six landscape types,  three of which are perhaps instantly more recognisable as farming landscapes. So you've  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:14):**  got Upland moorland, Upland open and Lowland open. I wonder if you could briefly talk us  through the key characteristics of each of these landscapes.  So I suppose the first important thing to remember here is these landscape types come  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:27):**  from the NRW land map evidence baseline for Wales classifications. And when we're stood  on a farm looking at the landscape around us, it appears to be a mix of many of these  land classifications. So in order to recognise the landscape types we're talking about, we  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:41):**  need a much wider field of view. Imagine standing on a hillside overlooking thousands of acres  of land and the view you now have will more closely reflect the landscape classifications  in this guide. Of the six landscape types, you're right in saying three are instantly  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:54):**  recognisable as farming landscapes. Upland moorland is likely to include some Upland  plateau, hillsides, scarp slopes and scree, and 20 to 50% of the area will have moorland  cover.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:05):**  And when you're talking about that, I imagine we're talking about, are we talking about  heather, gorsebracken, that sort of thing?  Exactly. So think heather clad hillsides and you're probably picturing an Upland moorland  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:16):**  landscape.  So how does that differentiate from Upland open?  So an Upland open landscape will also feature Upland valleys and hillsides, but with lower  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:24):**  plateau and scarp slopes and key it will feature at least 50% open grazed land. And if you  know any acid grassland or limestone pavements, you're probably thinking about an area of  Upland open landscape.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:37):**  The lowland open landscape is more likely to be the landscape that many people first  imagine when they think of farmland. Open field systems often laced with rivers, hedgerows  and occasional copses. The Clwyd Vale, which although largely outside the AONB is a lowland  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:51):**  open landscape and much of it is influenced by what happens in the Clwydian range and  D Valley AONB because the water that lands on our hills runs down into that lowland open  landscape.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:03):**  Chris, I'm sure those landscape types will be familiar to you. I mean, particularly around  Strouch you certainly got the lowland open, although you don't have Uplands in the way  that Wales has Uplands. You've got a lot of steep slopes and hills around you. And I'm  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:17):**  just wondering if you're, when you're thinking about water management in those landscapes,  what do you think would be the key issues there?  You're right. We're missing the moorland. Our Uplands are disguised somewhat because  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:28):**  they tend to be our freely draining or permeable soils. So we have our arable on our Upland  within the Cotswolds and then in the valleys and the lowland, we tend to get more permanent  grassland and extensive livestock. So I'm looking at how water moves through those different  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:44):**  landscapes and what has been done in various places over various generations to speed it  up. And then I'm thinking, can I gently unpick some of those watery modifications that have  been put in place by the generations of owners that have made those, particularly if those  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:01):**  aren't needed anymore because the farming systems moved on. So I'm tending to look at  any farm or land through that watery lens. And I'm generally looking at this kind of  basic hierarchy of activity. So I'm thinking firstly, can we create roughness through habitats  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:15):**  or changing vegetation? So in the Upland area, can we un-stitch some of the historical drainage  that's been in place and allow trees and scrub to recolonise some of those areas? Secondly,  I'm sort of looking at the way the farm is managed itself, so the farm system. So in  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:30):**  the Upland, up in grassland, I'm looking to see if there are changes to grazing and soil  management and cropping that will reduce runoff and slow flows. Are there any fundamental  changes to the farming system? I rarely get into those type of discussions myself, and  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:44):**  that's partly down to institutional expectations. So people are not generally expecting the  man from the council to get into a detailed discussion on soils and grazing, but they're  much more comfortable with me talking about the kind of the watery system itself. Thirdly,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:58):**  I'm thinking, are there any physical interventions that will slow flows? And this is what most  people are calling natural flood management. I'm thinking of the usual leaky dams, earth  buns on grassland, blocking drains, so making the kind of topographical changes that weren't  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:12):**  there before. And then finally, on the lowland open, we are really talking about opportunities  to attenuate or store water. So how is the floodplain being used? You know, there's a  lot of discussion about how we use our floodplains. There's a reason they're so fertile, and it  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:28):**  is because they're floodplains. So it's the historical pattern of flooding, which has  created some of our best quality farmland. But the irony, of course, is that to exploit  that now, we have to temporarily prevent the flooding, putting in place buns and embankments  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:43):**  to make it easier to farm. So I'm really thinking that can we reconnect those low flow channels  of what most people call the river with the high flow channel or the floodplain. So are  there opportunities to do something significant? I'm really interested in the historical  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:58):**  context that you've painted for us there. Because of course, I mean, as you quite rightly  say, the Victorians and beyond have been incredibly good at constraining water and speeding it  up and getting it from A to B much more quickly. And so that idea of reversing the speeding  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:14):**  up is a really interesting lens to look at this through. And you're talking there about  creating roughness, improving soil management and the physical interventions, the leaky  dams and the other things as well. And I'm wondering, Tom, does that correspond with  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:27):**  the sort of interventions that you have in mind, you know, writing and presenting this  report?  Yeah, I mean, Chris is clearly the natural flood management expert here. And it's really  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:35):**  interesting to listen to him and to learn from the work he's done. I know that in our  landscapes, we're looking at a wide variety of of NFM interventions from the subtle to  the large scale projects offering quantifiable impacts on flood events. But my key focus  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:50):**  is to integrate small changes that we already know are important and work into as many projects  as possible. So for example, encouraging our hedgerow planting grant scheme to prioritize  hedges that go across the contours on a farm before those that go down the contours. In  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:06):**  an ideal world, we'd do both. But if we can only do one, the hedges following the contours  provide the same package of biodiversity, shelter belts and grazing opportunities, but  also offer some NFM benefits as well. There may also be scope for leaky woody debris dams  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:20):**  and pools to slow water flow. And the work that I'm looking to do is to integrate as  many of these known, tried and tested NFM aspects into the other projects that are being  done widely across the AONB.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:32):**  It's really interesting when you talk about something as straightforward as instead of  planting hedges sort of vertically and you know, you go around Wales and many other upland  areas, you've got a lot of vertical walls, vertical hedges. And as soon as you turn that  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:46):**  around and they become horizontal following the contours, as you say, then they start  to not just capture water, but capture soil that runs off as well and some of the smaller  rock. And certainly, you know, from my own experience, driving around the countryside  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:01):**  after heavy rainfall, it is so frequent that you go past a gate or along a lane where loads  of topsoil is just being flushed away. And of course, if you look at aerial views of  Britain, then after really significant rainfall events, you can just see these enormous brown  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:18):**  plumes around the mouth of the river Severn, the mouth of river Thames, where we're just  losing all this fertile land, just flushing it into the sea. So what you're talking about  there is so important. And Tom, I guess the next question is about how to deliver these  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:33):**  mitigations and adaptations fairly quickly because climate change isn't hanging around.  And you've said that in the last eight months, since you published the report and started  having conversations with farmers, you've been on something of a learning journey. So  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:46):**  why and how?  Well, Finlow, I'm very open and honest about the fact that I don't come from a farming  background. So whilst I'm used to being in these landscapes, and I know the pressures  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:55):**  they're under, despite having lived alongside farmers, I don't have that first-hand experience  to draw upon, nor the detailed understanding of the day-to-day constraints and economics  of farming. And those aspects are essential to the potential success of any landscape  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:10):**  scale approach to mitigating and adapting for climate change. If we're asking farmers  to create more hay meadows to provide habitat for ground nesting birds, for example, or  to improve water retention and percolation, we need to understand the practical barriers  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:23):**  farmers face to this, to create strategy that's deliverable in the real world. Now, I'd  love to encourage every farmer to take the step to a fully regenerative approach. But  the reality is many cannot see how to do that without financially struggling themselves  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:37):**  through the transition. And some haven't seen the benefits of regen farming for themselves  yet. Engaging in the conversation is key. And so whether farmers are regenerative, organic,  reducing inputs, or just willing to question the status quo, we need to talk. And as you  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:51):**  said in your question, the key here is adapting quickly. And the key there is networking and  showcasing.  It's interesting that you talk about this, about recognising the economic impact. And  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:02):**  of course, some of those economic impacts of the kind of interventions that you're talking  about, the improvement in soil health, for example. So you've got a better functioning  soil carbon sponge that retains water and means that your grass is growing for longer  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:15):**  periods of the year will have positive environmental benefits. But then there are others where  there may be some degree of economic loss, particularly if you're taking areas of land  out of production. So it's understanding that economic context, I suppose, which is really  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:30):**  important and recognising that, you know, while farmers may well be very interested  in the environment and in habitat restoration, it needs to fit within their ability to actually  make money and feed their families quite apart from anything else. So if you were writing  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:45):**  the report again, are there things that you would want to emphasise more now that were  perhaps less obvious to a farming audience than the original?  I think if we were to write the guide again, or when we develop the next piece of work  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:57):**  in this vein, we'll work much closer with farmers, and especially regenerative farmers.  I'm eager to work with farmers on a project looking at how we can implement some of the  changes we all know need to happen, what can be done at a designated landscape or local  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:11):**  authority level to support farmers to farm with a more sustainability and biodiversity  focused mindset, what role farmers can play in natural flood management, and how this  can benefit water quality and communities downstream without having any negative impact  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:26):**  on the farmer's livelihood, or better still, how it can be done and also provide benefits  to the farmer. So having lived with the guide for almost nine months now, my appreciation  for the importance of the role of regenerative farming has increased exponentially. And I  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:41):**  think that any future work looking at the landscapes of the AOMB needs to be underpinned  by regenerative principles and practices.  Chris, coming back to you, I'd be interested in going into the Slad Valley in more detail.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:53):**  And I know that you're quite modest about the success of the Stroud project overall,  but homing in on the Slad Valley in particular, what's happened there has been unequivocally  good. The Slad Brook comes directly into the centre of Stroud from the surrounding landscape,  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:09):**  and the flood risk has been seriously alleviated. So what's actually happened in the Slad Valley?  The Slad Valley is the iconic landscape of the Stroud valleys, but it was also the place  that suffered some of the deepest flooding in 2007. So on the film we've produced, flood  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:26):**  water can be seen coming into the first floor windows, the bedrooms of some of our residents.  So it was an obvious place for us to focus on. It was one of the first places that we  looked to, to work when I started. We were lucky enough to find that the Gloucestershire  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:40):**  Wildlife Trust owned some areas of land in the valley, and we're one of the first organisations  with land to come on board and allow us to put some interventions in place. And this  acted as a bit of a catalyst for us. And then soon we were working with the upstream and  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:54):**  the downstream neighbours of the trust who were private owners, and then a few more landowners  and farmers in the valley. We were able to find and work with some of the landowners  to take advantage of classic upland floodplains, not the lowland type of floodplain, quite  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:09):**  small areas, but large flat areas where the stream had been put into a straight channel,  but we could attenuate extremely large quantities of water without causing any adverse impact  to the farmers because these were just simply secondary woodland habitat areas already.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:26):**  And that meant we could put a significant dent into the volumes of water to make a difference  to that extreme flood risk.  Toby  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:33):**  What I've really noticed in some of the places that I've lived around Britain is that if  you look at the landscape, there are lots of clues there about where water used to run  and where water used to be before the Victorians or people, you know, more recently moved it.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:48):**  Have you found that in the Slad Valley as well, that you can sort of see these areas  where there probably were streams in the past and you've been sort of able to work that  into your approach?  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:58):**  David  Yeah, we've, I'm always astounded by just how much, I guess, faffing people did in the  past. So for instance, moving streams over to the side of the valley. So the stream's  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:09):**  actually a metre or so above the valley floor, but people have forgotten that it would have  been on the valley floor originally and it's up on the side somewhere. Another thing we've  got quite a lot of, not particularly in the Slad Valley, but all over the Strand area  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:23):**  is old stone culverts. So streams covered over with large slabs of limestone and then  grassed over for the, I guess, the additional bit of extra grazing that that supplied because,  you know, that bit of extra grazing was fundamentally important to the livelihoods of the people  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:40):**  farming there. But now, of course, a metre or two of grazing down the middle of the field  is neither here nor there in some ways. So unpicking and identifying and unpicking some  of those kind of things that were done in the past that are no longer particularly relevant  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:55):**  or constraints to modern farming is really a key thing that we're looking for, both in  the Slad Valley and elsewhere.  Jason So that's interesting. There's a combination  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:03):**  there of this sort of early entrant into the scheme from the Wildlife Trust, but then,  you know, being able to get other farmers and land managers to participate, which has  been fantastic. And of course, Chris, by some estimates, the avoided damages in terms of  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:17):**  surrounding properties and businesses, every time there's a significant rainfall event,  which as we know is becoming more and more frequent, is somewhere in the region of £600,000  every time there's a big flood event. So how does that figure compare with the cost of  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:32):**  actually putting in the natural flood defences in the first place?  Chris Wow. Of course, the capital costs of the work  we do is completely dwarfed by those savings and those benefits. So we've had a number  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:44):**  of significant events since the work started and in 2016, which was the, I guess, one of  the last big ones. And because the Slad Valley has got this kind of historical pattern of  flooding, it's got a good network of flood warning gauges. And we've got excellent rainfall  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:59):**  data as well from Met Office stations that sit on either side of the top of the Slad Valley.  So we've been able to compare events that took place before our work started with the  one in 2016. And those figures come from the Environment Agency. And it's one of the ways  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:15):**  that they calculate whether a scheme is cost effective. So I'll just add, they're not completely  verified. They are kind of informal estimates. But they've calculated that with our interventions  in place, we have avoided those damages of that order of magnitude you mentioned. So  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:31):**  the cost of the interventions we've put in place, I mean, £600,000 was the total cost  of the project for six years, with all the many hundreds of interventions and my salary  and the costs involved in employing me. So, you know, just to put a figure on it, the  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:48):**  total costs in the Slad Valley to date are approximately £30,000. You know, we can see  that, of course, it's cheaper. One of the things I'll add, of course, is that, and I  know my Environment Agency colleagues would make this point too, that most flood risk  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:02):**  management will provide financial benefits greater than the cost of the actual interventions.  It's just that the magnitude of difference between our work and the benefits is so much  greater because it's much cheaper to put in place our type of interventions.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:17):**  What do you think has been particularly key to your success in the Slad Valley, Chris?  It's just the sheer number of interventions. If you look at natural flood management in  the round, there was a great report published by the Oxford Martin School. It's a restatement  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:33):**  of the evidence around natural flood management. And when you cut to the chase, there are two  things basically that indicate this approach will be successful. The first is the people  at risk are generally the type of people who suffer from frequent but lower magnitude floods.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:50):**  So 3% risk of flooding every year, let's put it that way. The second thing that the evidence  shows, and this is just a basic function of the maths, is that the approach works best  in smaller catchments. And that's because we can intervene in the right proportion of  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:06):**  the flows coming out of that catchment. So for instance, in the Slad Valley, it's approximately  13 kilometres squared if you add up all the land feeding into the stream, 80% of the flows  coming through that valley are now flowing through the stuff that we've put in place.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:21):**  So that's a really high percentage of the water flowing through that valley that's got  to fight its way through our interventions. As opposed to the rest of the Slad valleys,  if we take the whole of the river through, we're up to about 25%. So we're getting towards  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:36):**  a figure where we'd expect to see improvements. But you know, there's a large difference between  80 and 25. So it's the sheer number of interventions.  Now, Tom, you said that you believe regenerative agriculture is the way forward to deliver  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:50):**  multiple outcomes that benefit nature, farmers and citizens. How can you appeal to livestock  farmers to emphasise the benefits of environmental regeneration to their businesses?  Honestly, Finlow, I'm not sure if I will appeal to livestock farmers to influence their business  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:06):**  in any particular direction. But I'm certain that other farmers will, whether it be over  the farm gate, at market or online. Farmers talk and they share experiences. And I think  my role is to find ways to signpost and say yes when they come looking for help. Since  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:20):**  starting this project, my connections with farmers have all been through word of mouth.  So each farmer I meet leads me on to another conversation with another farmer. And they'd  only be doing that if they saw some value in the work that I'm doing, the conversations  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:32):**  we're having, or the doors that I can open for them. So I'm working hard to identify  funding and learning opportunities so that when a farmer asks me how they can better  manage water on their land, or how they can start moving toward a more regenerative way  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:45):**  of farming, I know where to point them for information and support or I know how I can  overcome some of the economic barriers to change. In my experience, many livestock farmers  question doing things differently, either when things go wrong for themselves, or when  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:59):**  things go better for their neighbour. And I'm hoping that by producing this guide and  having these conversations, we can start that question in mindset in farmers, ideally before  they have a crisis on their farm. But honestly, I think many already are in crisis. Once that  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:14):**  questioning mindset begins, then we need examples of successful attempts that do things differently  that deliver on these future desirable AOMB landscapes. I think farmers need to see positive  farming practices and hear about it from other farmers. So again, it's those central aspects  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:29):**  of networking and showcasing local positive action. As Chris was just saying, having examples  of interventions in place in landscape helps continue the conversation with other landowners  about putting more interventions into the landscape.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:42):**  It's interesting that you're talking about the peer to peer element there, because of  course that is so critical and so important. And part of the role of local councils and  the AOMB that you're working with is that it's often really good advice that doesn't  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:56):**  cost the earth. Tom, one of the things that struck me on reading the report is that it's  quite input heavy. It talks about things that farmers could and should do rather than focusing  on perhaps the outcomes that you'd like to see. And I wonder if there's scope for establishing  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:10):**  a more outcomes based approach to delivery.  So I think I've lived with this guide and I've been involved in it day in, day out for  coming on nine months now. And that reading it and rereading it, my perception of it's  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:22):**  evolved over the time. I think the words in the guide are maybe quite input focused, but  I think the illustrations that sit at the end of each landscape section show a vision  for a future landscape, an aspirational output. So the core principles that underpin the work  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:38):**  are that we maintain and conserve the special qualities of the AOMB. And within each landscape  type, we identify the key priorities and challenges. So outcomes such as improving habitat condition  in the upland moorland and focusing tree planting on hedgerows and parkland trees, shelter belts,  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:55):**  agroforestry, rather than intensive carbon sequestration tree planting projects, they  are in there. But I understand that can take a little bit of time living with the guide  and reading the guide to get into that nitty gritty of it and to see that outcome vision  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:10):**  for the landscape.  I'm interested in the way that outcomes and the choice of particular metrics or particular  outcomes can help to motivate different people. And so if you were talking to environmentalists  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:23):**  or NGOs, then perhaps a sort of a focus on land management and leaky dams and that sort  of thing might be really exciting. But if we're talking with farmers, perhaps actually  trying to reduce the instances of fluke or lameness in a sheep flock would actually be  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:38):**  really positive. And so if you know you were focused on those health outcomes for lambs  and showing that the way in which by managing water better in a landscape, they're able  to achieve better health and welfare and attract better prices at the abattoir.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:54):**  It's interesting, you should refer to farm and animal health there, Finlow, because one  of the primary motivations for allowing us to fence off a water course, within which  we could create some interventions for one of our farmers was the reduction in fluke  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:08):**  incidents that he expected to get as a result of that, as his animals have been stomping  around in the mud. And of course, fencing that water course out provides benefits to  the stream because it's stopping the poaching and stopping the soil erosion. But also he's  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:23):**  experiencing less instance of fluke.  I definitely think that's a really interesting approach to take. And it's maybe not the first  route that we took when we started conceiving this piece of work and thinking about it.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:36):**  But you know, this guide offered the kicking off point for conversations like this. And  hopefully by having those outcome based illustrations partnered with conversations like this, those  future pieces of work can be more outcome focused. And you know, I'm definitely learning  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:53):**  every day. I love that about this guide and my job. So by no means are we saying we've  got the guide right in its first guise, and perhaps a more outcome focused narrative would  be more engaging or more impactful. Now it's really time to listen and to keep learning  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:09):**  and driving forward. If any of your listeners are in North East Wales, I'm really keen to  come out and meet you bring you a copy of the guide and to listen to hear your points  of view and to understand what that next piece of work needs to look at so that it really  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:22):**  works for farmers, for the people who are actually going to do this.  Fantastic. Chris, at a national level, the government seems quite keen to fund the creation  of natural flood defences through ELMS, the environmental land management scheme that's  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:35):**  replacing the Common Agricultural Policy. And of course, it's worth mentioning that  ELMS is just for England and different schemes will exist in other parts of the United Kingdom.  However, the government seems less keen to fund the upkeep, the rental, if you like,  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:49):**  of these interventions going forward. They'll pay for a leaky dam, but they won't pay for  it to stay there in perpetuity. And I wonder how important that second element is.  Oh, it's incredibly important, Finn. If you look at the current model by which we operate  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:04):**  and by which most people involved in natural flood management buy natural flood management,  it's a model where I have some capital to spend and I approach the farmer or the lander  and I ask for their permission to spend my capital on your land. I currently have no  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:19):**  way of either compensating for any loss of production, although we try our best to design  interventions to reduce any impact on production, if that's the outcome desired by the landowner  and the farmer. But I've got no way of keeping that intervention in place, as you say, and  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:36):**  managing its upkeep and making sure it's there for the long term. And one of the things that  we always say about our approach to natural flood management is that it is a long term  piece of work. It is much more like farming, you know, there's no end to farming, it's  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:50):**  a cycle, you carry on and you adapt to new change as you learn more. In the same way  natural flood management doesn't have an end point. It's about trying to keep specific  numbers of changes and specific things in place for the long term as long as possible.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:06):**  So it's really important that any new prescriptions or options not only fund the capital, but  also the reward for the area benefiting around that. So for instance, you know, you might  look at an earth bund and think we can fund the creation of the earth bund. But of course,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:24):**  the area that that bund attenuates, fills with water occasionally and provides some  benefits. So it's about looking at the whole provision of the ecosystem service rather  than just the capital intervention.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:35):**  Jason Vale,  Well I think the world's become more polarised in recent decades, and more and more people  exist in silos and echo chambers. And, you know, I come from a climate change campaigning  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:04):**  background and I've been in more than a few meetings where organisations I've worked closely  with in the past have been disregarded for being too extreme in their eco mindsets. But  then I've also been in plenty of conversations with environmental activists where livestock  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:18):**  farmers have been made out to be the purveyors of all evil and awful environmental crimes.  And clearly neither of those narratives is right. But the major issue we face is around  closed mindsets. So when we only accept information from the same sources, when we refuse to question  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:34):**  the way we do things, I think that classical Victorian conservation mindset still exists  in some quarters. It certainly doesn't lead all conservation work now, but I do think  it's still there. And I don't think it's been as successful as it should have been given  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:49):**  the energy that's been ploughed into it. But then neither is the traditional farming approach.  We're seeing spiralling rates of poor mental health, suicide and collapsing livelihoods  in farming communities. And alongside that, we've got the climate and nature emergencies.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:04):**  And I don't think those issues can be tackled in isolation. We can't fix poor mental health  in farmers without also fixing the ecological and economic environment those farmers live  and work in. We can't fix the ecological emergency we're in by having a few pristine nature reserves  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:20):**  surrounded by farmland and livelihoods that are deteriorating. So farmers are the key  to tackling the climate and nature emergency, certainly here in North East Wales. And regenerative  farming looks to be the key to providing healthy, economically viable jobs, food security, carbon  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:37):**  sequestration, thriving ecosystems, all of the benefits that we know can come from regen  farming. Now, we do need campaign groups, NGOs, advocates, because they have a set of  tools that farmers working the field don't have. But farming has the tools to create  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:53):**  the ecological change that we so badly need. And my belief is that we'll achieve nature  recovery at a landscape scale by creating trusting, open and honest networks where farmers  can share their successes and their failures.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:06):**  And where I suppose, rather than trying to target single outcomes, which for me, I guess,  summarises the conservation mindset, it's about looking at multiple outcomes. And some  of those will be environmental, some economic, some climate, some biodiversity, some water,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:22):**  some social, some community. But looking at ways of achieving all of these things at once,  rather than simply restoring a habitat to benefit the turtle dove, we restore the very  building blocks of biodiversity so that all life can benefit from that as a result. That's  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:40):**  it's a really interesting conversation and one that I think is so incredibly important.  Chris, just finally, going back to 2007, at that time, we were still facing widespread  denial of global warming. That's changed now. Nobody serious denies that the climate  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:57):**  is changing or that we're facing a convergence of extreme weather events. Has this made it  any easier to deliver mitigations and adaptations like natural flood defences? Or does it still  come down to policy, time, personal relationships and money?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:11):**  I don't think it's made it any easier, Finlow, but it's made it much more urgent. It's creating  the backstory to the work that we're doing. So for instance, whereas farmers and landowners  in the Strand valleys might have been used to the sort of storm events that their forefathers  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:29):**  were used to, we're now having to see infrastructure and people expecting the type of climate that  we might get, or the type of rainfall we might get in the in the Lake District. So the infrastructure  we have on farms and in our urban areas just simply isn't up to the type of events that  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:45):**  we're getting. And I think you identify it really well, it is largely a combination of  those things. We do need better policy that makes it easier for people and local authorities  to start these type of projects to provide these benefits. And those projects do need  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:01):**  to recognise that most of the money will be in talking and engagement and building relationships.  It's not really just having the capital, it's having the people who can develop the conversations.  And I was struck by what Tom was saying there about, you know, sharing stories and it is  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:20):**  fundamentally about having a better story, in my view, and having some different stories  about how we can all contribute to either adaptation or mitigation. And we're working  in our projects at the moment with a local poet called Adam Horowitz, who lives in the  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:36):**  Sand Valley. He was the poet in residence of the Pasture Fed Livestock Association.  So he went to live with four farms in different settings, and he produced an anthology of  poems. And we've commissioned him to write a couple for us to help us tell a story in  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:50):**  a different way. I'm really struck by one of his poems in the anthology. And it's kind  of a founding statement of how we want to work in Stroud. And he says, too much fact  runs off busy people like water from compacted soil, learn how to open them to the seeds  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:08):**  of ideas, water them with stories and watch them grow. And that for me is a much better  description of this interface between how we work with farmers and land owners, how  we work with communities, and how we make sure that we're not over facing people with  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:25):**  too much detail. And that we're getting to the kind of the simple nub of it, which is  that we're in an emergency climate and nature, and we all need to play a part. And the work  we're doing is a part of helping our local communities to adapt to what's coming down  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:40):**  the road, both now and in the kind of next generations.  What a fantastic place to end this podcast. And you know, the idea that stories, shared  narratives are so important, because ultimately, it's people talking to people that makes the  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:57):**  change that we need to see. That's all we have time for. And thank you so much.

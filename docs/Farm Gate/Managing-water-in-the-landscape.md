### Farm Gate  (Wed, 17 Aug 2022 08:11:10)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Fenlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  
**[0:00:10-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:10):**  of the Food and Global Security Network.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:12):**  The way land is managed has a fundamental impact on our ability not only to mitigate  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:17):**  climate change by actively reducing the prevalence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but  
**[0:00:21-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:21):**  to help society adapt to the impacts of global warming. Farming and food production are central  
**[0:00:27-0:00:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:27):**  to this conversation.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:29):**  Many of us automatically associate extreme heat waves with global warming, but increased  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:33):**  rainfall and storm intensity are also hugely important characteristics of global temperature  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:39):**  rises. These changes in precipitation require that we learn and deploy different land and  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:44):**  habitat management techniques. For example, soil must be regenerated so that it can absorb  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:49):**  water that arrives in deluges and store it to support food production even during long,  
**[0:00:54-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:54):**  dry periods.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:00:55):**  But we also need farmers and other landowners to manage excess water flows so that communities  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:00):**  downstream are protected from flooding and the enormous cost, disruption and pain that  
**[0:01:06-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:06):**  that can bring.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:07):**  In this programme, we're talking about natural flood defences and ways to manage water in  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:11):**  the landscape. Chris Utley is the Stroud Valley's Natural Flood Management Officer for Stroud  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:16):**  District Council. And Tom Johnstone is the Strategic Climate Change, Green Infrastructure  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:21):**  and Catchments Officer for the Cluidian Range and D Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:26):**  Welcome both.  
**[0:01:27-0:01:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:27):**  Hi, Finn Lowe.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:28):**  Hi, thank you very much for having me.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:29):**  Chris, before we get into the details about particular projects, could we start by just  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:34):**  outlining what we mean by natural flood defences? For example, what sort of interventions are  
**[0:01:39-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:39):**  we talking about?  
**[0:01:40-0:01:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:40):**  There's a lot of mysteriousness about what we're actually talking about here, but we're  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:44):**  looking at the whole catchment approach to managing flows. We're looking at and trying  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:50):**  to understand how water moves through the landscape and then thinking about different  
**[0:01:55-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:55):**  natural flood management interventions or different interventions designed for different  
**[0:01:59-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:01:59):**  parts of that. So we want to try and intervene in all parts of the hydrograph. A hydrograph  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:04):**  is basically just a description of the way that the rainfall falls and then gets intercepted  
**[0:02:10-0:02:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:10):**  by plants. And then it starts to flow across the land. Some of it's transported by trees  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:15):**  into the air and some of it soaks into the soil. And then the stuff that's left after  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:20):**  it's gone back up into the air and into the soil flows across land. And so we're looking  
**[0:02:24-0:02:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:24):**  at surface flow routes, creating rougher forms of vegetation to slow that surface flow down,  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:31):**  or looking at opportunities for small scale intervention. And the way we do that is by  
**[0:02:36-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:36):**  managing or manipulating habitats and vegetation, looking at how we farm and how soils are managed,  
**[0:02:43-0:02:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:43):**  or by looking at changing the physical shape of the land or the streams. So adding trees  
**[0:02:49-0:02:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:49):**  to streams is a very popular intervention because they don't interfere with the main  
**[0:02:53-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:53):**  business of the farm itself. But we can also re-naturalise streams that have kind of been  
**[0:02:57-0:03:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:02:57):**  put into ditches and moved over to sides of the field. We can create low earth buttons  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:02):**  and grasslands across surface flow pathways. I guess the only other thing I'd add is that  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:07):**  natural is a bit of a misleading term because in many cases, this isn't just leaving things  
**[0:03:11-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:11):**  to nature. It's highly interventionist. It takes a great deal of effort to put in place  
**[0:03:16-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:16):**  so-called natural flood defences. If we compare it to what happens in a kind of contemporary  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:22):**  engineered scheme, most of the flood management that we see around us is designed to intervene  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:27):**  just in one part of that hydrograph. So that's high flows on main rivers. I think our approach  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:33):**  is about looking at the whole of the system from the top, from the rainfall, right through  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:38):**  to those kind of big flows and rivers, seeing if there's opportunities to intervene in all  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:43):**  parts of that sort of system.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:44):**  Jason Vale And when you say that natural is almost a  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:47):**  misnomer, the reality is that the whole of our landscape, the whole of our farmed landscape  
**[0:03:52-0:03:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:52):**  anyway, is unnatural. It's been managed and created over centuries by human beings. But  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:03:58):**  what we're talking about is the use of nature, the changing of nature, rather than the imposition  
**[0:04:04-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:04):**  of lots of metal and concrete.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:06):**  Ian Marber No, that's fair enough. So it's basically  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:08):**  understanding the practical application of geography. Leaky dams are now, I guess, have  
**[0:04:15-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:15):**  almost become synonymous with the approach, partly because to put it kind of bluntly,  
**[0:04:19-0:04:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:19):**  they're easy to do. I mean, for our type of project, they're relatively straightforward,  
**[0:04:25-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:25):**  partly because if you think about the sort of farmed landscape, and you've got the factory  
**[0:04:29-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:29):**  floor of the farm in the fields, most leaky dams can easily be deployed in the kind of  
**[0:04:35-0:04:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:35):**  what are called the non-food producing areas of the farm. So within the streams and within  
**[0:04:40-0:04:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:40):**  ditches. So they're often a kind of go to first thing because they're a physical manifestation  
**[0:04:46-0:04:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:46):**  of what we're trying to do. And they're acceptable to the farmer or the landowner.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:50):**  Jason Vale Chris, Stroud's approach to natural flood  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:52):**  defence has been held up as a nationwide exemplar. What happened to make Stroud take this issue  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:58):**  so seriously?  
**[0:04:59-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:59):**  Chris  
**[0:04:56-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:04:56):**  Well, in a nutshell, major flooding happened in 2007. Like a lot of the country, the Stroud  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:06):**  valleys were hit by those extreme storm events during the summer. Like lots of places, there's  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:12):**  a pattern, a historical pattern of flooding that stretches back into the memories of people  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:17):**  in the town. But 2007 was really the kind of foundational flood event. But flooding  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:22):**  creates a lot of anger amongst communities. It's intensely political. And when you've  
**[0:05:28-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:28):**  got an area like Stroud, lots of different parts of Stroud flooded, the people who live  
**[0:05:33-0:05:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:33):**  there become mobilised, they want something done. And they're also curious about what  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:38):**  they can do to resolve it. And flooding in rural areas, and particularly, you know, I'm  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:44):**  talking market towns, villages, is very different to the sort of flooding you might get in an  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:49):**  urban area, because the pattern of settlements are just different. So you know, there isn't  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:53):**  one big housing estate which gets clobbered, it's spread out down the whole of the river  
**[0:05:58-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:05:58):**  system. So no one big thing will prevent it from occurring. And if there is a big thing,  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:03):**  then only a small number of properties will benefit. So it makes it much less likely that  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:07):**  it will get funded. So after 2007, and bear in mind, this is kind of summarising years  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:12):**  of work, the environment agency and the Stroud authorities looked at a large storage area  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:17):**  in the Slag Valley. But this just wasn't feasible, because the geology, you know, this area's  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:22):**  got lots of clay, it's got lots of areas of what's called full as earth. So talcum powder,  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:28):**  and building large amounts of concrete and storing 1000s of tonnes of water on talcum  
**[0:06:33-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:33):**  powder, as I'm sure you could appreciate isn't a wise idea. We've also got lots of historic  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:39):**  infrastructure that's difficult to unpick. We've got culverts under houses, culverts  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:44):**  under our bus station, there's a cinema on top of the slag brook. So unpicking all that  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:50):**  is incredibly difficult. And the residents eventually realised that there was a new way  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:06:56):**  of looking at foot risk called Natural Foot Management, taking this whole system approach.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:00):**  And it was really down to them, they lobbied incredibly hard to get the funding for what  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:05):**  was quite an experimental approach at the time. So we spent eight years basically trying  
**[0:07:10-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:10):**  to work with as many landowners as possible to allow us to create this variety of features  
**[0:07:14-0:07:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:14):**  on their land that slow flows and benefit nature. The real innovation, though, was to  
**[0:07:18-0:07:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:18):**  put this job into the local authority.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:20):**  I'm going to go into some of the detail around what's happened in the Slad Valley a bit later  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:24):**  in the programme, but I'm really interested in the word anger, because it's not a word  
**[0:07:29-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:29):**  that I would necessarily instantly associate with flooding. I mean, there were lots and  
**[0:07:33-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:33):**  lots of emotions I can imagine being brought up. But anger is, is something quite specific.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:39):**  And what was it that people were angry about? Who was that anger targeted at?  
**[0:07:44-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:44):**  The anger is generally unfocused, but targeted at them. So I think we, you know, we live  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:52):**  in a sort of society and world where we generally think we're in control. And we generally feel  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:07:57):**  that, you know, we're an advanced developed society, and we control everything. We control  
**[0:08:02-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:02):**  our rivers, we control our land, we control our air. And flooding makes you realise that  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:07):**  actually, we are powerless in some circumstances. And when you feel powerlessness, then someone  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:14):**  has to be at fault. You know, something's gone wrong in the system, surely something  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:18):**  has been worked out in the past to stop us from being flooded. And I think that kind  
**[0:08:22-0:08:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:22):**  of searching for someone who will be responsible creates that anger. And I've met and talked  
**[0:08:29-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:29):**  with lots of people who've been flooded. And that initial burst of powerlessness and anger  
**[0:08:35-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:35):**  is very common, I think, amongst flooded communities. And working through that and kind of harnessing  
**[0:08:41-0:08:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:41):**  that in some ways to generate solutions to the problem can lead to a project such as  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:47):**  the one within Stroud, or it can obviously lead to other places that you know, where  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:52):**  there isn't such a good connection between what's happening on the land and the town.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:56):**  So a more fractured community.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:08:58):**  I think that's absolutely fascinating. And I think it's a salient message, really a wake  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:02):**  up call for other local authorities and other places around the world. When we know that  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:08):**  climate change is having the effects, the impacts that it's having, that if people aren't  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:13):**  planning, if local governments, authorities of one kind or another aren't taking steps  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:19):**  to intervene and make sure that these big flood events are better managed in the future,  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:24):**  then that anger will become only more palpable in the future. That's really interesting.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:29):**  Now, Tom, you've been sitting there very patiently. Let me come to you now. You've recently delivered  
**[0:09:33-0:09:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:33):**  a report for the Cluidian Range in Dee Valley AONB called Landscape and Nature Recovery  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:39):**  in a Changing Climate. What's the report setting out to achieve and what stage are  
**[0:09:43-0:09:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:43):**  you at in terms of delivery?  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:45):**  So the report is a collaborative piece of work between the AONB team and Natural Resources  
**[0:09:50-0:09:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:50):**  Wales aiming to take a landscape view of the risks that climate change poses to the protected  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:09:57):**  landscapes and the surrounding area, offering a range of mitigations and adaptations that  
**[0:10:02-0:10:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:02):**  may be suitable in addressing those risks and offers visualisations of potential future  
**[0:10:07-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:07):**  landscapes that may be more resilient, manage water better and protect the livelihoods of  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:12):**  those who live, work and visit the AONB. The guide has been developed to be a catalyst  
**[0:10:17-0:10:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:17):**  for conversations and change, and it's already proving successful in that. And we're driving  
**[0:10:22-0:10:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:22):**  the conversation forward with the landscape scale for you, which we feel is essential  
**[0:10:27-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:27):**  to creating economically and ecologically resilient countryside. And since its launch,  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:32):**  I've been almost entirely focused on getting the guide into the hands of farmers so I can  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:37):**  listen to their challenges, their worries, concerns, vision for the future and their  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:41):**  attitudes and views towards implementing some of the suggestions that we make.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:44):**  A lot of the connections that I've made within the farming community have come through word  
**[0:10:49-0:10:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:49):**  of mouth. So it's really been meeting a farmer who has read the guide and been interested  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:54):**  or engaged by it. And then they've sent me off to speak to their neighbour or speak to  
**[0:10:58-0:11:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:10:58):**  another farmer. What I'm really trying to do now is to try and find a broader church  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:03):**  of farmers to go and speak to.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:05):**  Tom, the report splits the Cluidian Range and Dee Valley area into six landscape types,  
**[0:11:10-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:10):**  three of which are perhaps instantly more recognisable as farming landscapes. So you've  
**[0:11:14-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:14):**  got Upland moorland, Upland open and Lowland open. I wonder if you could briefly talk us  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:19):**  through the key characteristics of each of these landscapes.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:22):**  So I suppose the first important thing to remember here is these landscape types come  
**[0:11:27-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:27):**  from the NRW land map evidence baseline for Wales classifications. And when we're stood  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:32):**  on a farm looking at the landscape around us, it appears to be a mix of many of these  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:36):**  land classifications. So in order to recognise the landscape types we're talking about, we  
**[0:11:41-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:41):**  need a much wider field of view. Imagine standing on a hillside overlooking thousands of acres  
**[0:11:46-0:11:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:46):**  of land and the view you now have will more closely reflect the landscape classifications  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:50):**  in this guide. Of the six landscape types, you're right in saying three are instantly  
**[0:11:54-0:11:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:54):**  recognisable as farming landscapes. Upland moorland is likely to include some Upland  
**[0:11:58-0:12:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:11:58):**  plateau, hillsides, scarp slopes and scree, and 20 to 50% of the area will have moorland  
**[0:12:04-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:04):**  cover.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:05):**  And when you're talking about that, I imagine we're talking about, are we talking about  
**[0:12:09-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:09):**  heather, gorsebracken, that sort of thing?  
**[0:12:11-0:12:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:11):**  Exactly. So think heather clad hillsides and you're probably picturing an Upland moorland  
**[0:12:16-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:16):**  landscape.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:17):**  So how does that differentiate from Upland open?  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:19):**  So an Upland open landscape will also feature Upland valleys and hillsides, but with lower  
**[0:12:24-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:24):**  plateau and scarp slopes and key it will feature at least 50% open grazed land. And if you  
**[0:12:30-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:30):**  know any acid grassland or limestone pavements, you're probably thinking about an area of  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:35):**  Upland open landscape.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:37):**  The lowland open landscape is more likely to be the landscape that many people first  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:41):**  imagine when they think of farmland. Open field systems often laced with rivers, hedgerows  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:46):**  and occasional copses. The Clwyd Vale, which although largely outside the AONB is a lowland  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:51):**  open landscape and much of it is influenced by what happens in the Clwydian range and  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:12:57):**  D Valley AONB because the water that lands on our hills runs down into that lowland open  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:02):**  landscape.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:03):**  Chris, I'm sure those landscape types will be familiar to you. I mean, particularly around  
**[0:13:07-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:07):**  Strouch you certainly got the lowland open, although you don't have Uplands in the way  
**[0:13:12-0:13:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:12):**  that Wales has Uplands. You've got a lot of steep slopes and hills around you. And I'm  
**[0:13:17-0:13:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:17):**  just wondering if you're, when you're thinking about water management in those landscapes,  
**[0:13:22-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:22):**  what do you think would be the key issues there?  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:23):**  You're right. We're missing the moorland. Our Uplands are disguised somewhat because  
**[0:13:28-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:28):**  they tend to be our freely draining or permeable soils. So we have our arable on our Upland  
**[0:13:35-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:35):**  within the Cotswolds and then in the valleys and the lowland, we tend to get more permanent  
**[0:13:39-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:39):**  grassland and extensive livestock. So I'm looking at how water moves through those different  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:44):**  landscapes and what has been done in various places over various generations to speed it  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:50):**  up. And then I'm thinking, can I gently unpick some of those watery modifications that have  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:13:56):**  been put in place by the generations of owners that have made those, particularly if those  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:01):**  aren't needed anymore because the farming systems moved on. So I'm tending to look at  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:05):**  any farm or land through that watery lens. And I'm generally looking at this kind of  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:09):**  basic hierarchy of activity. So I'm thinking firstly, can we create roughness through habitats  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:15):**  or changing vegetation? So in the Upland area, can we un-stitch some of the historical drainage  
**[0:14:20-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:20):**  that's been in place and allow trees and scrub to recolonise some of those areas? Secondly,  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:26):**  I'm sort of looking at the way the farm is managed itself, so the farm system. So in  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:30):**  the Upland, up in grassland, I'm looking to see if there are changes to grazing and soil  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:35):**  management and cropping that will reduce runoff and slow flows. Are there any fundamental  
**[0:14:39-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:39):**  changes to the farming system? I rarely get into those type of discussions myself, and  
**[0:14:44-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:44):**  that's partly down to institutional expectations. So people are not generally expecting the  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:48):**  man from the council to get into a detailed discussion on soils and grazing, but they're  
**[0:14:53-0:14:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:53):**  much more comfortable with me talking about the kind of the watery system itself. Thirdly,  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:14:58):**  I'm thinking, are there any physical interventions that will slow flows? And this is what most  
**[0:15:02-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:02):**  people are calling natural flood management. I'm thinking of the usual leaky dams, earth  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:07):**  buns on grassland, blocking drains, so making the kind of topographical changes that weren't  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:12):**  there before. And then finally, on the lowland open, we are really talking about opportunities  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:17):**  to attenuate or store water. So how is the floodplain being used? You know, there's a  
**[0:15:22-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:22):**  lot of discussion about how we use our floodplains. There's a reason they're so fertile, and it  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:28):**  is because they're floodplains. So it's the historical pattern of flooding, which has  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:33):**  created some of our best quality farmland. But the irony, of course, is that to exploit  
**[0:15:38-0:15:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:38):**  that now, we have to temporarily prevent the flooding, putting in place buns and embankments  
**[0:15:43-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:43):**  to make it easier to farm. So I'm really thinking that can we reconnect those low flow channels  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:50):**  of what most people call the river with the high flow channel or the floodplain. So are  
**[0:15:54-0:15:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:54):**  there opportunities to do something significant? I'm really interested in the historical  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:15:58):**  context that you've painted for us there. Because of course, I mean, as you quite rightly  
**[0:16:02-0:16:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:02):**  say, the Victorians and beyond have been incredibly good at constraining water and speeding it  
**[0:16:09-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:09):**  up and getting it from A to B much more quickly. And so that idea of reversing the speeding  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:14):**  up is a really interesting lens to look at this through. And you're talking there about  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:19):**  creating roughness, improving soil management and the physical interventions, the leaky  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:23):**  dams and the other things as well. And I'm wondering, Tom, does that correspond with  
**[0:16:27-0:16:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:27):**  the sort of interventions that you have in mind, you know, writing and presenting this  
**[0:16:31-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:31):**  report?  
**[0:16:32-0:16:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:32):**  Yeah, I mean, Chris is clearly the natural flood management expert here. And it's really  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:35):**  interesting to listen to him and to learn from the work he's done. I know that in our  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:40):**  landscapes, we're looking at a wide variety of of NFM interventions from the subtle to  
**[0:16:45-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:45):**  the large scale projects offering quantifiable impacts on flood events. But my key focus  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:50):**  is to integrate small changes that we already know are important and work into as many projects  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:16:56):**  as possible. So for example, encouraging our hedgerow planting grant scheme to prioritize  
**[0:17:01-0:17:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:01):**  hedges that go across the contours on a farm before those that go down the contours. In  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:06):**  an ideal world, we'd do both. But if we can only do one, the hedges following the contours  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:10):**  provide the same package of biodiversity, shelter belts and grazing opportunities, but  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:14):**  also offer some NFM benefits as well. There may also be scope for leaky woody debris dams  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:20):**  and pools to slow water flow. And the work that I'm looking to do is to integrate as  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:25):**  many of these known, tried and tested NFM aspects into the other projects that are being  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:30):**  done widely across the AONB.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:32):**  It's really interesting when you talk about something as straightforward as instead of  
**[0:17:35-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:35):**  planting hedges sort of vertically and you know, you go around Wales and many other upland  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:41):**  areas, you've got a lot of vertical walls, vertical hedges. And as soon as you turn that  
**[0:17:46-0:17:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:46):**  around and they become horizontal following the contours, as you say, then they start  
**[0:17:50-0:17:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:50):**  to not just capture water, but capture soil that runs off as well and some of the smaller  
**[0:17:56-0:18:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:17:56):**  rock. And certainly, you know, from my own experience, driving around the countryside  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:01):**  after heavy rainfall, it is so frequent that you go past a gate or along a lane where loads  
**[0:18:08-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:08):**  of topsoil is just being flushed away. And of course, if you look at aerial views of  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:13):**  Britain, then after really significant rainfall events, you can just see these enormous brown  
**[0:18:18-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:18):**  plumes around the mouth of the river Severn, the mouth of river Thames, where we're just  
**[0:18:23-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:23):**  losing all this fertile land, just flushing it into the sea. So what you're talking about  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:28):**  there is so important. And Tom, I guess the next question is about how to deliver these  
**[0:18:33-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:33):**  mitigations and adaptations fairly quickly because climate change isn't hanging around.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:38):**  And you've said that in the last eight months, since you published the report and started  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:41):**  having conversations with farmers, you've been on something of a learning journey. So  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:46):**  why and how?  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:47):**  Well, Finlow, I'm very open and honest about the fact that I don't come from a farming  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:51):**  background. So whilst I'm used to being in these landscapes, and I know the pressures  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:18:55):**  they're under, despite having lived alongside farmers, I don't have that first-hand experience  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:00):**  to draw upon, nor the detailed understanding of the day-to-day constraints and economics  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:05):**  of farming. And those aspects are essential to the potential success of any landscape  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:10):**  scale approach to mitigating and adapting for climate change. If we're asking farmers  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:14):**  to create more hay meadows to provide habitat for ground nesting birds, for example, or  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:19):**  to improve water retention and percolation, we need to understand the practical barriers  
**[0:19:23-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:23):**  farmers face to this, to create strategy that's deliverable in the real world. Now, I'd  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:28):**  love to encourage every farmer to take the step to a fully regenerative approach. But  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:32):**  the reality is many cannot see how to do that without financially struggling themselves  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:37):**  through the transition. And some haven't seen the benefits of regen farming for themselves  
**[0:19:41-0:19:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:41):**  yet. Engaging in the conversation is key. And so whether farmers are regenerative, organic,  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:46):**  reducing inputs, or just willing to question the status quo, we need to talk. And as you  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:51):**  said in your question, the key here is adapting quickly. And the key there is networking and  
**[0:19:56-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:56):**  showcasing.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:19:57):**  It's interesting that you talk about this, about recognising the economic impact. And  
**[0:20:02-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:02):**  of course, some of those economic impacts of the kind of interventions that you're talking  
**[0:20:07-0:20:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:07):**  about, the improvement in soil health, for example. So you've got a better functioning  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:11):**  soil carbon sponge that retains water and means that your grass is growing for longer  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:15):**  periods of the year will have positive environmental benefits. But then there are others where  
**[0:20:20-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:20):**  there may be some degree of economic loss, particularly if you're taking areas of land  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:26):**  out of production. So it's understanding that economic context, I suppose, which is really  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:30):**  important and recognising that, you know, while farmers may well be very interested  
**[0:20:35-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:35):**  in the environment and in habitat restoration, it needs to fit within their ability to actually  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:40):**  make money and feed their families quite apart from anything else. So if you were writing  
**[0:20:45-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:45):**  the report again, are there things that you would want to emphasise more now that were  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:50):**  perhaps less obvious to a farming audience than the original?  
**[0:20:52-0:20:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:52):**  I think if we were to write the guide again, or when we develop the next piece of work  
**[0:20:57-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:20:57):**  in this vein, we'll work much closer with farmers, and especially regenerative farmers.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:02):**  I'm eager to work with farmers on a project looking at how we can implement some of the  
**[0:21:07-0:21:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:07):**  changes we all know need to happen, what can be done at a designated landscape or local  
**[0:21:11-0:21:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:11):**  authority level to support farmers to farm with a more sustainability and biodiversity  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:17):**  focused mindset, what role farmers can play in natural flood management, and how this  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:21):**  can benefit water quality and communities downstream without having any negative impact  
**[0:21:26-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:26):**  on the farmer's livelihood, or better still, how it can be done and also provide benefits  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:31):**  to the farmer. So having lived with the guide for almost nine months now, my appreciation  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:36):**  for the importance of the role of regenerative farming has increased exponentially. And I  
**[0:21:41-0:21:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:41):**  think that any future work looking at the landscapes of the AOMB needs to be underpinned  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:45):**  by regenerative principles and practices.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:47):**  Chris, coming back to you, I'd be interested in going into the Slad Valley in more detail.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:53):**  And I know that you're quite modest about the success of the Stroud project overall,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:21:59):**  but homing in on the Slad Valley in particular, what's happened there has been unequivocally  
**[0:22:04-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:04):**  good. The Slad Brook comes directly into the centre of Stroud from the surrounding landscape,  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:09):**  and the flood risk has been seriously alleviated. So what's actually happened in the Slad Valley?  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:15):**  The Slad Valley is the iconic landscape of the Stroud valleys, but it was also the place  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:21):**  that suffered some of the deepest flooding in 2007. So on the film we've produced, flood  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:26):**  water can be seen coming into the first floor windows, the bedrooms of some of our residents.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:32):**  So it was an obvious place for us to focus on. It was one of the first places that we  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:35):**  looked to, to work when I started. We were lucky enough to find that the Gloucestershire  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:40):**  Wildlife Trust owned some areas of land in the valley, and we're one of the first organisations  
**[0:22:45-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:45):**  with land to come on board and allow us to put some interventions in place. And this  
**[0:22:49-0:22:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:49):**  acted as a bit of a catalyst for us. And then soon we were working with the upstream and  
**[0:22:54-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:54):**  the downstream neighbours of the trust who were private owners, and then a few more landowners  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:22:58):**  and farmers in the valley. We were able to find and work with some of the landowners  
**[0:23:03-0:23:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:03):**  to take advantage of classic upland floodplains, not the lowland type of floodplain, quite  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:09):**  small areas, but large flat areas where the stream had been put into a straight channel,  
**[0:23:14-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:14):**  but we could attenuate extremely large quantities of water without causing any adverse impact  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:21):**  to the farmers because these were just simply secondary woodland habitat areas already.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:26):**  And that meant we could put a significant dent into the volumes of water to make a difference  
**[0:23:30-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:30):**  to that extreme flood risk.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:31):**  Toby  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:33):**  What I've really noticed in some of the places that I've lived around Britain is that if  
**[0:23:37-0:23:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:37):**  you look at the landscape, there are lots of clues there about where water used to run  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:43):**  and where water used to be before the Victorians or people, you know, more recently moved it.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:48):**  Have you found that in the Slad Valley as well, that you can sort of see these areas  
**[0:23:52-0:23:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:52):**  where there probably were streams in the past and you've been sort of able to work that  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:57):**  into your approach?  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:58):**  David  
**[0:23:59-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:23:59):**  Yeah, we've, I'm always astounded by just how much, I guess, faffing people did in the  
**[0:24:05-0:24:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:05):**  past. So for instance, moving streams over to the side of the valley. So the stream's  
**[0:24:09-0:24:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:09):**  actually a metre or so above the valley floor, but people have forgotten that it would have  
**[0:24:14-0:24:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:14):**  been on the valley floor originally and it's up on the side somewhere. Another thing we've  
**[0:24:19-0:24:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:19):**  got quite a lot of, not particularly in the Slad Valley, but all over the Strand area  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:23):**  is old stone culverts. So streams covered over with large slabs of limestone and then  
**[0:24:29-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:29):**  grassed over for the, I guess, the additional bit of extra grazing that that supplied because,  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:34):**  you know, that bit of extra grazing was fundamentally important to the livelihoods of the people  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:40):**  farming there. But now, of course, a metre or two of grazing down the middle of the field  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:44):**  is neither here nor there in some ways. So unpicking and identifying and unpicking some  
**[0:24:49-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:49):**  of those kind of things that were done in the past that are no longer particularly relevant  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:24:55):**  or constraints to modern farming is really a key thing that we're looking for, both in  
**[0:25:00-0:25:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:00):**  the Slad Valley and elsewhere.  
**[0:25:01-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:01):**  Jason So that's interesting. There's a combination  
**[0:25:03-0:25:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:03):**  there of this sort of early entrant into the scheme from the Wildlife Trust, but then,  
**[0:25:08-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:08):**  you know, being able to get other farmers and land managers to participate, which has  
**[0:25:12-0:25:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:12):**  been fantastic. And of course, Chris, by some estimates, the avoided damages in terms of  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:17):**  surrounding properties and businesses, every time there's a significant rainfall event,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:22):**  which as we know is becoming more and more frequent, is somewhere in the region of £600,000  
**[0:25:28-0:25:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:28):**  every time there's a big flood event. So how does that figure compare with the cost of  
**[0:25:32-0:25:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:32):**  actually putting in the natural flood defences in the first place?  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:35):**  Chris Wow. Of course, the capital costs of the work  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:39):**  we do is completely dwarfed by those savings and those benefits. So we've had a number  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:44):**  of significant events since the work started and in 2016, which was the, I guess, one of  
**[0:25:50-0:25:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:50):**  the last big ones. And because the Slad Valley has got this kind of historical pattern of  
**[0:25:55-0:25:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:55):**  flooding, it's got a good network of flood warning gauges. And we've got excellent rainfall  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:25:59):**  data as well from Met Office stations that sit on either side of the top of the Slad Valley.  
**[0:26:05-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:05):**  So we've been able to compare events that took place before our work started with the  
**[0:26:09-0:26:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:09):**  one in 2016. And those figures come from the Environment Agency. And it's one of the ways  
**[0:26:15-0:26:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:15):**  that they calculate whether a scheme is cost effective. So I'll just add, they're not completely  
**[0:26:21-0:26:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:21):**  verified. They are kind of informal estimates. But they've calculated that with our interventions  
**[0:26:27-0:26:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:27):**  in place, we have avoided those damages of that order of magnitude you mentioned. So  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:31):**  the cost of the interventions we've put in place, I mean, £600,000 was the total cost  
**[0:26:38-0:26:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:38):**  of the project for six years, with all the many hundreds of interventions and my salary  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:43):**  and the costs involved in employing me. So, you know, just to put a figure on it, the  
**[0:26:48-0:26:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:48):**  total costs in the Slad Valley to date are approximately £30,000. You know, we can see  
**[0:26:53-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:53):**  that, of course, it's cheaper. One of the things I'll add, of course, is that, and I  
**[0:26:58-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:26:58):**  know my Environment Agency colleagues would make this point too, that most flood risk  
**[0:27:02-0:27:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:02):**  management will provide financial benefits greater than the cost of the actual interventions.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:08):**  It's just that the magnitude of difference between our work and the benefits is so much  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:13):**  greater because it's much cheaper to put in place our type of interventions.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:17):**  What do you think has been particularly key to your success in the Slad Valley, Chris?  
**[0:27:22-0:27:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:22):**  It's just the sheer number of interventions. If you look at natural flood management in  
**[0:27:27-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:27):**  the round, there was a great report published by the Oxford Martin School. It's a restatement  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:33):**  of the evidence around natural flood management. And when you cut to the chase, there are two  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:37):**  things basically that indicate this approach will be successful. The first is the people  
**[0:27:42-0:27:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:42):**  at risk are generally the type of people who suffer from frequent but lower magnitude floods.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:50):**  So 3% risk of flooding every year, let's put it that way. The second thing that the evidence  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:27:56):**  shows, and this is just a basic function of the maths, is that the approach works best  
**[0:28:01-0:28:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:01):**  in smaller catchments. And that's because we can intervene in the right proportion of  
**[0:28:06-0:28:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:06):**  the flows coming out of that catchment. So for instance, in the Slad Valley, it's approximately  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:11):**  13 kilometres squared if you add up all the land feeding into the stream, 80% of the flows  
**[0:28:17-0:28:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:17):**  coming through that valley are now flowing through the stuff that we've put in place.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:21):**  So that's a really high percentage of the water flowing through that valley that's got  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:26):**  to fight its way through our interventions. As opposed to the rest of the Slad valleys,  
**[0:28:30-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:30):**  if we take the whole of the river through, we're up to about 25%. So we're getting towards  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:36):**  a figure where we'd expect to see improvements. But you know, there's a large difference between  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:41):**  80 and 25. So it's the sheer number of interventions.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:45):**  Now, Tom, you said that you believe regenerative agriculture is the way forward to deliver  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:50):**  multiple outcomes that benefit nature, farmers and citizens. How can you appeal to livestock  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:28:56):**  farmers to emphasise the benefits of environmental regeneration to their businesses?  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:01):**  Honestly, Finlow, I'm not sure if I will appeal to livestock farmers to influence their business  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:06):**  in any particular direction. But I'm certain that other farmers will, whether it be over  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:10):**  the farm gate, at market or online. Farmers talk and they share experiences. And I think  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:15):**  my role is to find ways to signpost and say yes when they come looking for help. Since  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:20):**  starting this project, my connections with farmers have all been through word of mouth.  
**[0:29:24-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:24):**  So each farmer I meet leads me on to another conversation with another farmer. And they'd  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:28):**  only be doing that if they saw some value in the work that I'm doing, the conversations  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:32):**  we're having, or the doors that I can open for them. So I'm working hard to identify  
**[0:29:36-0:29:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:36):**  funding and learning opportunities so that when a farmer asks me how they can better  
**[0:29:41-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:41):**  manage water on their land, or how they can start moving toward a more regenerative way  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:45):**  of farming, I know where to point them for information and support or I know how I can  
**[0:29:50-0:29:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:50):**  overcome some of the economic barriers to change. In my experience, many livestock farmers  
**[0:29:55-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:55):**  question doing things differently, either when things go wrong for themselves, or when  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:29:59):**  things go better for their neighbour. And I'm hoping that by producing this guide and  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:04):**  having these conversations, we can start that question in mindset in farmers, ideally before  
**[0:30:09-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:09):**  they have a crisis on their farm. But honestly, I think many already are in crisis. Once that  
**[0:30:14-0:30:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:14):**  questioning mindset begins, then we need examples of successful attempts that do things differently  
**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:19):**  that deliver on these future desirable AOMB landscapes. I think farmers need to see positive  
**[0:30:24-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:24):**  farming practices and hear about it from other farmers. So again, it's those central aspects  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:29):**  of networking and showcasing local positive action. As Chris was just saying, having examples  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:34):**  of interventions in place in landscape helps continue the conversation with other landowners  
**[0:30:40-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:40):**  about putting more interventions into the landscape.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:42):**  It's interesting that you're talking about the peer to peer element there, because of  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:46):**  course that is so critical and so important. And part of the role of local councils and  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:51):**  the AOMB that you're working with is that it's often really good advice that doesn't  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:30:56):**  cost the earth. Tom, one of the things that struck me on reading the report is that it's  
**[0:31:01-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:01):**  quite input heavy. It talks about things that farmers could and should do rather than focusing  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:06):**  on perhaps the outcomes that you'd like to see. And I wonder if there's scope for establishing  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:10):**  a more outcomes based approach to delivery.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:13):**  So I think I've lived with this guide and I've been involved in it day in, day out for  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:18):**  coming on nine months now. And that reading it and rereading it, my perception of it's  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:22):**  evolved over the time. I think the words in the guide are maybe quite input focused, but  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:27):**  I think the illustrations that sit at the end of each landscape section show a vision  
**[0:31:31-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:31):**  for a future landscape, an aspirational output. So the core principles that underpin the work  
**[0:31:38-0:31:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:38):**  are that we maintain and conserve the special qualities of the AOMB. And within each landscape  
**[0:31:43-0:31:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:43):**  type, we identify the key priorities and challenges. So outcomes such as improving habitat condition  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:49):**  in the upland moorland and focusing tree planting on hedgerows and parkland trees, shelter belts,  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:31:55):**  agroforestry, rather than intensive carbon sequestration tree planting projects, they  
**[0:32:00-0:32:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:00):**  are in there. But I understand that can take a little bit of time living with the guide  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:05):**  and reading the guide to get into that nitty gritty of it and to see that outcome vision  
**[0:32:10-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:10):**  for the landscape.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:11):**  I'm interested in the way that outcomes and the choice of particular metrics or particular  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:17):**  outcomes can help to motivate different people. And so if you were talking to environmentalists  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:23):**  or NGOs, then perhaps a sort of a focus on land management and leaky dams and that sort  
**[0:32:28-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:28):**  of thing might be really exciting. But if we're talking with farmers, perhaps actually  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:32):**  trying to reduce the instances of fluke or lameness in a sheep flock would actually be  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:38):**  really positive. And so if you know you were focused on those health outcomes for lambs  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:43):**  and showing that the way in which by managing water better in a landscape, they're able  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:49):**  to achieve better health and welfare and attract better prices at the abattoir.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:54):**  It's interesting, you should refer to farm and animal health there, Finlow, because one  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:32:58):**  of the primary motivations for allowing us to fence off a water course, within which  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:04):**  we could create some interventions for one of our farmers was the reduction in fluke  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:08):**  incidents that he expected to get as a result of that, as his animals have been stomping  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:13):**  around in the mud. And of course, fencing that water course out provides benefits to  
**[0:33:19-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:19):**  the stream because it's stopping the poaching and stopping the soil erosion. But also he's  
**[0:33:23-0:33:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:23):**  experiencing less instance of fluke.  
**[0:33:25-0:33:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:25):**  I definitely think that's a really interesting approach to take. And it's maybe not the first  
**[0:33:32-0:33:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:32):**  route that we took when we started conceiving this piece of work and thinking about it.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:36):**  But you know, this guide offered the kicking off point for conversations like this. And  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:42):**  hopefully by having those outcome based illustrations partnered with conversations like this, those  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:48):**  future pieces of work can be more outcome focused. And you know, I'm definitely learning  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:53):**  every day. I love that about this guide and my job. So by no means are we saying we've  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:33:57):**  got the guide right in its first guise, and perhaps a more outcome focused narrative would  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:03):**  be more engaging or more impactful. Now it's really time to listen and to keep learning  
**[0:34:09-0:34:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:09):**  and driving forward. If any of your listeners are in North East Wales, I'm really keen to  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:13):**  come out and meet you bring you a copy of the guide and to listen to hear your points  
**[0:34:18-0:34:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:18):**  of view and to understand what that next piece of work needs to look at so that it really  
**[0:34:22-0:34:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:22):**  works for farmers, for the people who are actually going to do this.  
**[0:34:26-0:34:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:26):**  Fantastic. Chris, at a national level, the government seems quite keen to fund the creation  
**[0:34:31-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:31):**  of natural flood defences through ELMS, the environmental land management scheme that's  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:35):**  replacing the Common Agricultural Policy. And of course, it's worth mentioning that  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:39):**  ELMS is just for England and different schemes will exist in other parts of the United Kingdom.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:44):**  However, the government seems less keen to fund the upkeep, the rental, if you like,  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:49):**  of these interventions going forward. They'll pay for a leaky dam, but they won't pay for  
**[0:34:53-0:34:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:53):**  it to stay there in perpetuity. And I wonder how important that second element is.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:34:58):**  Oh, it's incredibly important, Finn. If you look at the current model by which we operate  
**[0:35:04-0:35:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:04):**  and by which most people involved in natural flood management buy natural flood management,  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:09):**  it's a model where I have some capital to spend and I approach the farmer or the lander  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:14):**  and I ask for their permission to spend my capital on your land. I currently have no  
**[0:35:19-0:35:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:19):**  way of either compensating for any loss of production, although we try our best to design  
**[0:35:25-0:35:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:25):**  interventions to reduce any impact on production, if that's the outcome desired by the landowner  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:31):**  and the farmer. But I've got no way of keeping that intervention in place, as you say, and  
**[0:35:36-0:35:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:36):**  managing its upkeep and making sure it's there for the long term. And one of the things that  
**[0:35:40-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:40):**  we always say about our approach to natural flood management is that it is a long term  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:45):**  piece of work. It is much more like farming, you know, there's no end to farming, it's  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:50):**  a cycle, you carry on and you adapt to new change as you learn more. In the same way  
**[0:35:56-0:36:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:35:56):**  natural flood management doesn't have an end point. It's about trying to keep specific  
**[0:36:01-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:01):**  numbers of changes and specific things in place for the long term as long as possible.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:06):**  So it's really important that any new prescriptions or options not only fund the capital, but  
**[0:36:14-0:36:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:14):**  also the reward for the area benefiting around that. So for instance, you know, you might  
**[0:36:20-0:36:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:20):**  look at an earth bund and think we can fund the creation of the earth bund. But of course,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:24):**  the area that that bund attenuates, fills with water occasionally and provides some  
**[0:36:29-0:36:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:29):**  benefits. So it's about looking at the whole provision of the ecosystem service rather  
**[0:36:34-0:36:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:34):**  than just the capital intervention.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:35):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:36:43-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:43):**  Well I think the world's become more polarised in recent decades, and more and more people  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:36:59):**  exist in silos and echo chambers. And, you know, I come from a climate change campaigning  
**[0:37:04-0:37:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:04):**  background and I've been in more than a few meetings where organisations I've worked closely  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:09):**  with in the past have been disregarded for being too extreme in their eco mindsets. But  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:14):**  then I've also been in plenty of conversations with environmental activists where livestock  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:18):**  farmers have been made out to be the purveyors of all evil and awful environmental crimes.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:23):**  And clearly neither of those narratives is right. But the major issue we face is around  
**[0:37:28-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:28):**  closed mindsets. So when we only accept information from the same sources, when we refuse to question  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:34):**  the way we do things, I think that classical Victorian conservation mindset still exists  
**[0:37:40-0:37:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:40):**  in some quarters. It certainly doesn't lead all conservation work now, but I do think  
**[0:37:45-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:45):**  it's still there. And I don't think it's been as successful as it should have been given  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:49):**  the energy that's been ploughed into it. But then neither is the traditional farming approach.  
**[0:37:54-0:37:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:54):**  We're seeing spiralling rates of poor mental health, suicide and collapsing livelihoods  
**[0:37:58-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:37:58):**  in farming communities. And alongside that, we've got the climate and nature emergencies.  
**[0:38:04-0:38:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:04):**  And I don't think those issues can be tackled in isolation. We can't fix poor mental health  
**[0:38:10-0:38:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:10):**  in farmers without also fixing the ecological and economic environment those farmers live  
**[0:38:15-0:38:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:15):**  and work in. We can't fix the ecological emergency we're in by having a few pristine nature reserves  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:20):**  surrounded by farmland and livelihoods that are deteriorating. So farmers are the key  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:25):**  to tackling the climate and nature emergency, certainly here in North East Wales. And regenerative  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:31):**  farming looks to be the key to providing healthy, economically viable jobs, food security, carbon  
**[0:38:37-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:37):**  sequestration, thriving ecosystems, all of the benefits that we know can come from regen  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:42):**  farming. Now, we do need campaign groups, NGOs, advocates, because they have a set of  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:48):**  tools that farmers working the field don't have. But farming has the tools to create  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:53):**  the ecological change that we so badly need. And my belief is that we'll achieve nature  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:38:58):**  recovery at a landscape scale by creating trusting, open and honest networks where farmers  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:03):**  can share their successes and their failures.  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:06):**  And where I suppose, rather than trying to target single outcomes, which for me, I guess,  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:12):**  summarises the conservation mindset, it's about looking at multiple outcomes. And some  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:16):**  of those will be environmental, some economic, some climate, some biodiversity, some water,  
**[0:39:22-0:39:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:22):**  some social, some community. But looking at ways of achieving all of these things at once,  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:27):**  rather than simply restoring a habitat to benefit the turtle dove, we restore the very  
**[0:39:33-0:39:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:33):**  building blocks of biodiversity so that all life can benefit from that as a result. That's  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:40):**  it's a really interesting conversation and one that I think is so incredibly important.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:44):**  Chris, just finally, going back to 2007, at that time, we were still facing widespread  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:52):**  denial of global warming. That's changed now. Nobody serious denies that the climate  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:39:57):**  is changing or that we're facing a convergence of extreme weather events. Has this made it  
**[0:40:02-0:40:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:02):**  any easier to deliver mitigations and adaptations like natural flood defences? Or does it still  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:07):**  come down to policy, time, personal relationships and money?  
**[0:40:11-0:40:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:11):**  I don't think it's made it any easier, Finlow, but it's made it much more urgent. It's creating  
**[0:40:17-0:40:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:17):**  the backstory to the work that we're doing. So for instance, whereas farmers and landowners  
**[0:40:22-0:40:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:22):**  in the Strand valleys might have been used to the sort of storm events that their forefathers  
**[0:40:29-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:29):**  were used to, we're now having to see infrastructure and people expecting the type of climate that  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:35):**  we might get, or the type of rainfall we might get in the in the Lake District. So the infrastructure  
**[0:40:39-0:40:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:39):**  we have on farms and in our urban areas just simply isn't up to the type of events that  
**[0:40:45-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:45):**  we're getting. And I think you identify it really well, it is largely a combination of  
**[0:40:50-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:50):**  those things. We do need better policy that makes it easier for people and local authorities  
**[0:40:55-0:41:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:40:55):**  to start these type of projects to provide these benefits. And those projects do need  
**[0:41:01-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:01):**  to recognise that most of the money will be in talking and engagement and building relationships.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:08):**  It's not really just having the capital, it's having the people who can develop the conversations.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:15):**  And I was struck by what Tom was saying there about, you know, sharing stories and it is  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:20):**  fundamentally about having a better story, in my view, and having some different stories  
**[0:41:25-0:41:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:25):**  about how we can all contribute to either adaptation or mitigation. And we're working  
**[0:41:32-0:41:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:32):**  in our projects at the moment with a local poet called Adam Horowitz, who lives in the  
**[0:41:36-0:41:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:36):**  Sand Valley. He was the poet in residence of the Pasture Fed Livestock Association.  
**[0:41:40-0:41:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:40):**  So he went to live with four farms in different settings, and he produced an anthology of  
**[0:41:45-0:41:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:45):**  poems. And we've commissioned him to write a couple for us to help us tell a story in  
**[0:41:50-0:41:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:50):**  a different way. I'm really struck by one of his poems in the anthology. And it's kind  
**[0:41:56-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:41:56):**  of a founding statement of how we want to work in Stroud. And he says, too much fact  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:03):**  runs off busy people like water from compacted soil, learn how to open them to the seeds  
**[0:42:08-0:42:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:08):**  of ideas, water them with stories and watch them grow. And that for me is a much better  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:15):**  description of this interface between how we work with farmers and land owners, how  
**[0:42:20-0:42:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:20):**  we work with communities, and how we make sure that we're not over facing people with  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:25):**  too much detail. And that we're getting to the kind of the simple nub of it, which is  
**[0:42:29-0:42:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:29):**  that we're in an emergency climate and nature, and we all need to play a part. And the work  
**[0:42:34-0:42:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:34):**  we're doing is a part of helping our local communities to adapt to what's coming down  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:40):**  the road, both now and in the kind of next generations.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:43):**  What a fantastic place to end this podcast. And you know, the idea that stories, shared  
**[0:42:50-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:50):**  narratives are so important, because ultimately, it's people talking to people that makes the  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Managing-water-in-the-landscape-e1m3cnt#t=0:42:57):**  change that we need to see. That's all we have time for. And thank you so much. I'd

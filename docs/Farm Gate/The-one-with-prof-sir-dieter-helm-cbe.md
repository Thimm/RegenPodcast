**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Kustain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and founder  
**[0:00:09-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:09):**  of the Food and Global Security Network.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:12):**  Sir Dieter Helms, CBE, is Professor of Economic Policy at the University of Oxford and Fellow  
**[0:00:17-0:00:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:17):**  in Economics at New College, Oxford. From 2012 to 2020, he was the Independent Chair  
**[0:00:23-0:00:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:23):**  of the Natural Capital Committee and he was knighted in the 2021 New Year's Honours  
**[0:00:27-0:00:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:27):**  List for services to the Environment, Energy and Utilities Policy. His most recent books  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:32):**  are Net Zero and Green and Prosperous Land. Welcome, Dieter. Thanks so much for joining  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:38):**  me. Is the environment safer now that the trust government has been replaced?  
**[0:00:43-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:43):**  Almost certainly, yes, but that's a pretty low baseline. There was a real threat to rolling  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:50):**  back all the things that have been achieved in the last two or three, four years and all  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:00:55):**  the spirit of the legislation that's been put in place. And when the new Prime Minister  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:01):**  and the first Prime Minister question time highlighted, without being asked, his belief  
**[0:01:07-0:01:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:07):**  that the Environment Act was a substantive achievement of the Conservatives, that I think  
**[0:01:13-0:01:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:13):**  to me was an important and another U-turn from what trust and kwatang had been threatening  
**[0:01:19-0:01:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:19):**  us with.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:20):**  So, was this just a kind of a blip and the last few years continue as if that blip never  
**[0:01:26-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:26):**  existed?  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:27):**  Well, I think you have to understand what was really going on behind the election of  
**[0:01:31-0:01:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:31):**  trust and kwatang. You know, it's all to do with Brexit. It's pretty apparent, whether  
**[0:01:37-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:37):**  you're pro or anti Brexit, that Brexit has caused a big hit on the British economy. After  
**[0:01:42-0:01:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:42):**  all, we now have the greatest trade deficit of all time except two years during the Second  
**[0:01:48-0:01:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:48):**  World War when the Americans were bailing us out. It can't be the case that Brexit has  
**[0:01:52-0:01:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:52):**  made trade easier and the outcome of Brexit has not been a massive burst of growth. So,  
**[0:01:59-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:01:59):**  when trust and kwatang say they wanted more economic growth, and indeed to be fair, since  
**[0:02:05-0:02:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:05):**  Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer said the same thing beforehand, the Brexiteers on the right  
**[0:02:12-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:12):**  of the Tory party always had in mind that Brexit was a means, not an end in itself,  
**[0:02:20-0:02:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:20):**  and a means to creating a deregulated, low tax, so-called Singaporean Thames. And that's  
**[0:02:26-0:02:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:26):**  a perfectly coherent argument. What's happened is that it's been systematically rejected,  
**[0:02:32-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:32):**  and that's a very important step forward. But Singaporean Thames means relaxing a lot  
**[0:02:39-0:02:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:39):**  of the environmental considerations, regulations and initiatives, and means essentially going  
**[0:02:45-0:02:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:45):**  back to the idea, economic development in the narrow and crude sense first, environment  
**[0:02:51-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:51):**  a luxury, which we can currently ill afford. And that's how we got to this attack on nature.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:02:58):**  And the idea, the bizarre idea, actually, that pursuing environmental policies was somehow  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:04):**  anti-growth. It's pro-growth, and we might come to that.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:07):**  Yeah, I'm interested because, of course, the Conservative policy will now be to continue  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:12):**  with the policies that we've had over the last few years developed in that post-Brexit  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:16):**  conversation. And the Labour Party has the idea, really, that you can be environmental,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:21):**  but to be environmental, you need to invest in the economy. You need to invest in growth  
**[0:03:25-0:03:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:25):**  to achieve that growth. So I wonder where it was that Liz Truss was coming from in her  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:31):**  idea that somehow the green agenda was anti-growth. Do you have any insight into what it was that  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:36):**  she was thinking?  
**[0:03:37-0:03:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:37):**  Well, if we look at the architecture of environmental policy in the UK post-Brexit, and it's largely  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:45):**  associated with Gove, but not entirely, there are three bits. There's the bit that came  
**[0:03:51-0:03:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:51):**  before, which is the 219 amendment to the Climate Change Act, which puts the net zero  
**[0:03:56-0:04:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:03:56):**  target at 100% for 250. That's cross-party support. That's what the Conservatives signed  
**[0:04:03-0:04:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:03):**  up to. And that's what the kerfuffle has been about, about whether Sunnock goes to COP26  
**[0:04:08-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:08):**  and when some of the right wing of the Tory party suggests that now isn't the time, etc.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:15):**  Well, that's the first pillar box. The second pillar is the Agricultural Act. And the Agricultural  
**[0:04:20-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:20):**  Act sits there as defining a new framework in which public money for public goods is  
**[0:04:28-0:04:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:28):**  central and also polluter pays. And it's the biggest break since 1948 in British agricultural  
**[0:04:35-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:35):**  policy. The third bit is the Environment Act, the one I had most to do with, which is about  
**[0:04:42-0:04:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:42):**  embedding essentially the 25-year plan and trying to meet Gove's commitment that environmental  
**[0:04:49-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:49):**  standards will be higher than Europe, not lower going forward. So those are the three  
**[0:04:53-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:04:53):**  bits of architecture. The deep question is, do those three bits of the environmental legislation  
**[0:05:00-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:00):**  framework, that architecture, do they increase economic growth or do they stand in the way?  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:05):**  And the crude anti-growth argument about this stuff is, you know, it's newts in ponds that  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:11):**  builders can't build things. It's objections to putting pylons all over the place. It's  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:17):**  building on the green belt and somehow the environment stands against that. Well, all  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:22):**  those issues were already there. Okay. And some of them are just, you know, tropes and  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:28):**  others are serious. But the main point is that investing in net zero, developing renewables,  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:35):**  developing batteries, developing electric cars, developing hydrogen, developing nuclear  
**[0:05:40-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:40):**  maybe, all of those things are serious investments in the economy. And it's very hard to argue  
**[0:05:45-0:05:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:45):**  they're anti-growth. When it comes to agriculture, you start from a very low base. It's 0.5%  
**[0:05:51-0:05:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:51):**  of GDP. It's by far the biggest causer of climate change relative to its size in the  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:05:57):**  economy, right? Its emissions are, when properly measured, not far short of the whole of the  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:02):**  power sector, but it's a very small part. It's very hard to work out how you could get  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:08):**  less value for money than under the CAP scheme of paying people to own land. If you want  
**[0:06:13-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:13):**  to improve productivity, which is in the quasi-quatern growth plan, it clearly identifies low productivity  
**[0:06:20-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:20):**  in agriculture as a problem. Well, paying people to own land is clearly not going to  
**[0:06:24-0:06:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:24):**  help increase productivity, whereas promoting soil protection or that kind of stuff is contributing.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:32):**  So you get into that space on agriculture. And on the environment side, if you have poor  
**[0:06:36-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:36):**  health, rivers in a terrible state, if you have waste all over the countryside, right,  
**[0:06:43-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:43):**  it's hardly, hardly contributing to people's wellbeing in the wider sense of economic prosperity.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:51):**  It is also actually narrowly anti-growth too. And so that's why I think, flipping night's  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:06:57):**  head, it's not the environmental policies were anti-growth, they're pro-growth. The  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:01):**  trust plan actually for all it's dressing up was itself anti-growth because it was going  
**[0:07:07-0:07:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:07):**  to undermine things which will contribute to a sustainable economy going forward.  
**[0:07:12-0:07:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:12):**  Now, you mentioned GDP there in relation to agriculture. And of course, yes, that's absolutely  
**[0:07:16-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:16):**  right that in GDP terms, agriculture doesn't earn a huge amount, but when we factor in  
**[0:07:21-0:07:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:21):**  those other things, those external costs, the costs to wellbeing of poor decisions in  
**[0:07:26-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:26):**  terms of agriculture, the costs to our environment, then that cost becomes much more significant  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:31):**  and the impact on people and society more broadly becomes very significant.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:35):**  Yeah. I mean, one way of putting what you've just said is to say that if you take the full  
**[0:07:39-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:39):**  cost of agriculture into account, it actually negatively contributes to the economy. It's  
**[0:07:44-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:44):**  minus, right? It starts with 0.5 plus, but once you subtract off the costs of all the  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:50):**  pollution in the rivers, the environmental emissions, the net zero emissions, damage  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:07:56):**  to biodiversity and the countryside, once you add those things in, yeah, you get to  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:01):**  a negative value for agriculture. And all I'm saying is not farmers fault, what farmers  
**[0:08:06-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:06):**  are doing in responding to the incentives that are in front of them. You know, I have  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:09):**  a hugely optimistic view about this. Since it's pretty hard to do it worse, and it's  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:15):**  pretty hard to get so little value out of our land, it must be possible to improve upon  
**[0:08:21-0:08:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:21):**  that position and thereby improve the economy. Now, GDP doesn't capture some of this stuff  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:26):**  and it doesn't worry about the state of assets, it just looks at flows. But any sensible measure  
**[0:08:32-0:08:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:32):**  of how well our economy is doing, whether it's sustainable, whether we're passing on  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:38):**  an economy and a set of opportunities for the next generation, at least as good as we've  
**[0:08:41-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:41):**  got, any sensible measure would say that the scope for improvement from the outcomes of  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:48):**  agriculture is one of the lowest hanging fruits in the economy.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:52):**  Just before we move on to how we start to get there, I suppose, I just want to come  
**[0:08:56-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:08:56):**  back to what you mentioned about Rishi Sunak there. Of course, he has taken this decision  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:02):**  not to go to COP, and even if he reverses that decision in the future, is that a win  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:07):**  for the right wing of the Conservative Party? He has reversed his decision. That's now been  
**[0:09:13-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:13):**  announced. I think it was inevitable. Is that a win or lose to the right wing of the Conservative  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:20):**  Party? I mean, you know, one has to take politics seriously. Because someone's on the right  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:26):**  wing of the Tory party doesn't make them wrong about all sorts of things. And we need to  
**[0:09:31-0:09:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:31):**  be very careful to distinguish between arguments that the right make, which have substance,  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:38):**  and we all ought to take seriously, and arguments which are based on a different social and  
**[0:09:43-0:09:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:43):**  moral basis than other people might share. It's very important to have them as like,  
**[0:09:49-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:49):**  understanding why people voted for Brexit and respecting the fact they voted for Brexit,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:53):**  even if, in my case, I'm not in favour of this policy. So the decision to go to COP  
**[0:09:59-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:09:59):**  in 27 is symbolic. And because Biden's going, it kind of makes it what all these COPs are,  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:06):**  which is an opportunity for meetings on the side about other stuff. It's a lot easier  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:11):**  to go and do this than do all the pomp and ceremony of a visit to the White House. The  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:16):**  really interesting question is, does it make any difference? And my view is we've had 26  
**[0:10:21-0:10:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:21):**  COPs so far, every single year since 1990. When we started this process, we've added  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:25):**  two parts per million concentration of carbon in the atmosphere, which is what the climate  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:30):**  change is about, it's about the stock of carbon in the atmosphere. And the NDC framework on  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:35):**  carbon territorial emissions is not the way to measure the stuff. It flatters the UK in  
**[0:10:41-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:41):**  a way which is, in my view, totally undeserved. The transfers to developing countries are  
**[0:10:49-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:49):**  smaller than the annual dividend of Saudi Aramco. And what's being done to protect the  
**[0:10:53-0:11:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:10:53):**  rainforest is pretty limited. And my own view is that it's good to have climate change highlighted.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:00):**  And that's what COPs do. But if anyone thinks the COP process is going to crack climate  
**[0:11:05-0:11:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:05):**  change, I'm afraid I'm on a different planet for them. There's no evidence he's done that  
**[0:11:10-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:10):**  so far. And this convenient argument for politicians, you know, one more heave and we're going to  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:15):**  get there. Sadly, very sadly, that's just not true. What will the right say about this?  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:21):**  Your trust was going to go, of course it was going to go, world stage. So they can't really  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:26):**  object across the party to Sunak going, I mean, I think, you know, there'll be quite  
**[0:11:32-0:11:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:32):**  a lot of emissions from the plane flight out there and the other people go with him, and  
**[0:11:36-0:11:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:36):**  the emissions coming back. Will it make a difference? No. Is it probably politically  
**[0:11:41-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:41):**  wise to do? Yes. And, you know, the Conservatives are, under Sunak, really very keen to get  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:49):**  back on the go of agenda. And that's very much Sunak's approach. And it's really distinct  
**[0:11:55-0:12:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:11:55):**  from Truss's approach. You talk about yourself as an optimist, and yet there you're talking  
**[0:12:00-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:00):**  about the COP process, really describing it as a failure in many ways over the course  
**[0:12:07-0:12:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:07):**  of the last 26, 27 years. I wonder what makes you feel optimistic when we think forward  
**[0:12:13-0:12:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:13):**  about climate change and the other elements of the crises in nature. So biodiversity,  
**[0:12:18-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:18):**  loss and desertification, what makes you feel optimistic that we can solve this big problem  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:24):**  that we all face, this great challenge? OK, so the first point to say is there is no doubt  
**[0:12:29-0:12:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:29):**  the COP process has failed, right? We're on 417 parts per million carbon in the atmosphere.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:35):**  And if anyone told you at the beginning of this process that we'd add two parts per million  
**[0:12:40-0:12:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:40):**  of carbon equivalent to the atmosphere every single year, including the financial crisis  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:44):**  and including the lockdowns, they would not call that a success. So anyone who claims  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:49):**  a success, go back to 1990, look at what the aspiration was, or 92, and look at the outcome.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:12:56):**  It's a ghastly failure. And I don't say that it wouldn't have been even worse without the  
**[0:13:02-0:13:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:02):**  COP process. And I don't say that people shouldn't continue to meet up. But I do believe one  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:09):**  more heave is going to fail. The second point about optimism is that you need to work out  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:15):**  where we are. You need to be brutally realistic about the baseline. And that's what I am.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:21):**  I do want to call a spade a spade. You know, it isn't going well. Similarly on biodiversity,  
**[0:13:27-0:13:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:27):**  we have one of the most biodiversity depleted countries on the planet, right? It's not going  
**[0:13:33-0:13:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:33):**  well. I was visiting peat bogs last week in Scotland and seeing the damage being done,  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:37):**  that has been done. So you need to be brutally realistic, which gets you to the baseline.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:42):**  Then there's two steps to the optimism. The first one is it's pretty hard to do it worse.  
**[0:13:47-0:13:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:47):**  You know, you can't do things much worse than pay people to own land. You can't do it much  
**[0:13:53-0:13:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:53):**  worse than have territorial carbon emissions basis which don't take into account imports  
**[0:13:59-0:14:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:13:59):**  and our carbon footprint. You can't do it much worse than including dracs, sorry, excluding  
**[0:14:04-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:04):**  dracs as emissions from our measurement of what we're doing. And so on and so on. You  
**[0:14:09-0:14:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:09):**  know, there's only one way we really can go, which is up. Now the second point is lots  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:15):**  of people say, well, okay, so we can improve things incrementally. But you know, it's not  
**[0:14:20-0:14:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:20):**  the revolution that just stop oil or extinction rebellion would look for. I think, by the  
**[0:14:25-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:25):**  way, those kinds of things are utterly hopeless. And they backfire really badly. But the assumption  
**[0:14:32-0:14:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:32):**  that people make is that all we've got to address these great environmental problems,  
**[0:14:38-0:14:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:38):**  biodiversity, land, climate change, etc, is just the toolbox that exists today in the  
**[0:14:44-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:44):**  garage. And in my lifetime, I've gone from doing my doctoral thesis on Olympus portable  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:51):**  typewriter with Tippex and carbon paper, when there were no fax machines, which I noticed  
**[0:14:55-0:15:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:14:55):**  today are about to be phased out, no mobile phones, no internet, no digital data, none  
**[0:15:01-0:15:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:01):**  of that stuff. And in my lifetime, my world has been utterly transformed in a way I had  
**[0:15:07-0:15:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:07):**  no idea was going to happen. And if you look to the technology, there are all these people  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:12):**  who say, well, well, you're a techno optimist, etc. You know, that's naive. The issue is,  
**[0:15:17-0:15:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:17):**  our technologies marching on, which are helping to address these questions in every university  
**[0:15:22-0:15:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:22):**  I go to, it's full of bright young people trying to come up with new ways of addressing  
**[0:15:27-0:15:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:27):**  climate change. We've got digital data, which tells us what's happening on every square  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:31):**  20 metres of this planet, we can see exactly what people are doing. We can look at catchments,  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:37):**  we can model them, we can use the data in ways we never could do in the past. You can  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:42):**  even track a cocoon from one end of Africa to the UK and back in real time. All of this  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:47):**  stuff adds, you know, electric cars are primitive, the batteries are still environmentally pretty  
**[0:15:53-0:15:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:53):**  awful. But you know, there are new generations of batteries to come, right? And then there's  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:15:57):**  energy, you know, the sun comes up every day, it delivers more energy in an hour than the  
**[0:16:03-0:16:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:03):**  entire world's electricity industry produces in a year. Okay, there is no shortage of energy.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:08):**  The shortage is our ability to harness this stuff without having to fall back on fossil  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:14):**  fuels to deal with intermittency, low density, diffuse types of renewables, for example,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:21):**  in a constructive way. And you know, when I go around my university, and I talk to people  
**[0:16:27-0:16:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:27):**  doing their doctorates, just postdoctoral, etc, it's pretty damn exciting in the way  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:32):**  it was that my university could produce a vaccine in seven to 10 days from receiving  
**[0:16:37-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:37):**  a genetic code, which we would not have had 10 years ago, with a small bunch of scientists.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:43):**  You know, this is revolutionary stuff. And we shouldn't be starry eyed about science,  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:48):**  we should be realistic. But let's be honest, unless we have better technologies, we ain't  
**[0:16:53-0:16:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:53):**  going to crack our problems.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:54):**  W  
**[0:16:55-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:16:55):**  about the way that the world has changed so much just in the last 30 years. And, you know,  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:01):**  therefore, it's perhaps a fool's game to try and understand or work out exactly what's  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:05):**  going to happen in the next 30 years. I think it's important in terms of trying to plan  
**[0:17:09-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:09):**  for the future to have a vision of what that future looks like, and perhaps to work backwards  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:14):**  from there. So, in terms of looking forwards and planning backwards, what do you think  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:19):**  our farmed and wild landscapes should look like in Britain in 2050?  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:23):**  Well, let me let me come at that slightly indirectly. Okay, so I think that a sustainable  
**[0:17:29-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:29):**  economy is an economy where we husband the assets of the economy, such that the next  
**[0:17:36-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:36):**  generation has a set of assets to choose how to live their lives. They have the capabilities  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:42):**  to do what they want to do. We don't try and make them happy, like, you know, GDP terms,  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:47):**  we don't know what the opportunities are going to be. But they need certain things. And for  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:52):**  me, the things that need to be in place to make this stuff happen are the infrastructures,  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:17:58):**  the system infrastructures, which underpin an economy. Now, there are some system infrastructures  
**[0:18:03-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:03):**  which we're very familiar with, you need an energy infrastructure to participate in society  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:08):**  for firms to operate, you need a transport infrastructure, you need a broadband fibre  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:12):**  infrastructure, right, you need a water infrastructure, because without those things, it's going to  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:18):**  work. You need an educational infrastructure, and you need a health infrastructure. And  
**[0:18:22-0:18:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:22):**  you need underpinning all of them, a natural capital set of infrastructure systems. Okay,  
**[0:18:29-0:18:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:29):**  that's what an economy is to me. It isn't just, you know, anything's equivalent to anything  
**[0:18:33-0:18:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:33):**  else as modern economists look at things, some things are more important than others.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:37):**  And the core of what any state has to make sure exists, and any society is that framework  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:44):**  of the basic things for which we will operate, we will function, and indeed, to be honest,  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:50):**  all the pollution goes through it too. So that's what you have to concentrate on putting  
**[0:18:53-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:53):**  in place. Now, the natural environment, which underpins that law, what's it going to look  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:18:59):**  like in 250? Well, you know, there's all sorts of things we cannot know. But there are some  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:04):**  things we do know. And there are some things we can focus down upon. First is that unless  
**[0:19:10-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:10):**  it's green, we're not going to be prosperous. Okay, so we want decent rivers, we want biodiversity  
**[0:19:17-0:19:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:17):**  rich rivers, we want lower carbon in the atmosphere, we want better air quality, we want waste  
**[0:19:24-0:19:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:24):**  properly recycled. Turns out, these are the things in the 25 year plan, and they're going  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:28):**  to be the statutory targets, right? These are, it's not rocket science to work this  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:32):**  out. Then there's a broader question, which is the one that's largely done, which is,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:37):**  what's our land use going to be? And therefore, what is our land use strategy plan and framework?  
**[0:19:45-0:19:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:45):**  And we basically think that the answer to that question historically has been loads  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:50):**  of agricultural subsidies, and the planning regime. It's all about planning. Well, it's  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:19:55):**  much more than that. It's about systems, okay, and what those systems need to look like,  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:01):**  in order to ensure that they are genuinely, in the natural capital sense, renewable, they  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:06):**  sustain themselves and drive themselves forward.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:09):**  So you've talked about system infrastructures there, and I find that a really interesting  
**[0:20:12-0:20:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:12):**  way of thinking of and talking about nature, because you've talked about the way that humans  
**[0:20:18-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:18):**  can develop their own infrastructure. So for example, energy infrastructure, the transition  
**[0:20:23-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:23):**  from a fossil fuel based energy economy to one that includes renewables, wind and solar,  
**[0:20:29-0:20:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:29):**  and various other things, perhaps that we've not even thought of yet. At the same time  
**[0:20:32-0:20:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:32):**  is then looking at piping, water infrastructure, transport infrastructure, education, broadband,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:37):**  all those sorts of things. But then I think within infrastructure, you're also thinking  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:41):**  about the structure of our soils, making sure that our soils function, making sure that  
**[0:20:46-0:20:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:46):**  our biodiversity functions, that our water cycles properly through the land.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:50):**  Oh, absolutely. And the question is practically, what kind of system units to use to think  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:20:56):**  about this problem? Now I like to think about catchments, because the UK is not the standard  
**[0:21:01-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:01):**  drought this year, it's full of catchments. And catchments are always integrated, what  
**[0:21:06-0:21:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:06):**  happens at the top affects what happens at the bottom, etc. And actually, many of our  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:10):**  problems can be encapsulated within what I describe as system plans, system architecture  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:16):**  for catchments. So you take the Thames, and you start at the top and you go to the bottom,  
**[0:21:21-0:21:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:21):**  and you add up all the money we're currently spending on the Thames, flood defence, concrete,  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:26):**  all that kind of stuff. We're, I mean, bluntly paying farmers to pollute the Thames, we have  
**[0:21:32-0:21:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:32):**  lots of money spent on recreation down the Thames, we spend a huge amount of money clearing  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:36):**  up the muck that's in the water system that's been put in it by various players in the river,  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:41):**  and so on and so forth. And when you add this lot up for any major catchment, it's a hell  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:46):**  of a lot of money. And again, I come back to my optimistic point, you couldn't spend  
**[0:21:49-0:21:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:49):**  it worse. Can you imagine a system where you actually think it's sensible to subsidise  
**[0:21:55-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:55):**  someone to put the pollution in the river, and then you pay in your water bills to have  
**[0:21:58-0:22:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:21:58):**  it taken out again? It's nonsense, right? So if you look at natural capital ways of  
**[0:22:03-0:22:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:03):**  addressing a river catchment, you think about flood defence being largely natural, there  
**[0:22:10-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:10):**  will of course have to be some infrastructure, physical concrete stuff, but most of it can  
**[0:22:14-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:14):**  be natural. You think about carbon sequestration, well, where would you put the trees? Along  
**[0:22:19-0:22:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:19):**  the river banks. Why? Because you'd stop the runoff from the land, you'd be a filter for  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:24):**  some of the chemicals coming in, you'd slow down the water flow, it'd be much better for  
**[0:22:29-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:29):**  the water itself, because it would cool it and provide shade, and it'd be damn good for  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:32):**  recreation and therefore mental and physical health. And then you go down the system and  
**[0:22:38-0:22:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:38):**  you think about what the water company does, how it handles its sewage further down, whether  
**[0:22:44-0:22:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:44):**  it uses reed beds and stuff to do that. And so once you start to think about that, when  
**[0:22:48-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:48):**  you think about the net economic gain, the economic growth in the end, the well being  
**[0:22:52-0:22:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:52):**  of us that comes out of it, then you go back to, well, why the hell are we paying farmers  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:22:58):**  to do what they do and causing these incentives, which they rightly exploit, instead of paying  
**[0:23:04-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:04):**  them for public goods and contribute to this? I'll give you another example. So there's  
**[0:23:08-0:23:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:08):**  this scheme to put a canal round Oxford to stop flooding on the west of Botley, and no  
**[0:23:13-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:13):**  reason why listeners will know Botley, but it's just a low lying area on the west of  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:18):**  Oxford. And the question is, well, how much is that going to cost? And how much works  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:23):**  are involved in it? And the crucial thing in any environmental question, is there any  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:28):**  alternative? Well, would you want to spend a couple hundred million doing this? Or would  
**[0:23:32-0:23:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:32):**  you want to pay the Wildlife Trust upriver a few tens of million to hold back the water  
**[0:23:38-0:23:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:38):**  and have all the biodiversity benefits of preserving water meadows, etc?  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:42):**  And indeed, not just the Wildlife Trust, but the farmers as well, who can make sure that  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:45):**  land is functioning better.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:47):**  Absolutely. Why can't they bid to do this? It's against the concrete or the engineered  
**[0:23:53-0:23:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:53):**  solution. Now, it may or may not be the right answer. But in my world, I'm in this sense,  
**[0:23:58-0:24:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:23:58):**  I'm very pro competition. I want to define what it is we need in our catchments. So we  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:02):**  make sure the next generation inherits the catchments in good shape, nature's in good  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:07):**  form, etc. But I want the system architect to auction this to all of any party that might  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:12):**  contribute to it and bring farmers right into the fray. So I'm a very, it's very odd, and  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:18):**  sometimes it's presented the wrong way, but I'm very pro farmers, you know, we have to  
**[0:24:22-0:24:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:22):**  have people that manage the land, and I'm actually very pro food production, and I'm  
**[0:24:26-0:24:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:26):**  very pro thinking about soils as public goods. But, you know, in the end, if you don't create  
**[0:24:32-0:24:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:32):**  the right incentive structure, if you don't invite people to the table to join in the  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:37):**  economic fest, if you like, the opportunities of contracts and so on, you're not going to  
**[0:24:42-0:24:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:42):**  make progress. Can I ask you about that idea of competition? Because one of the concerns  
**[0:24:46-0:24:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:46):**  that I have is that in having a competition for natural capital delivery, there is a danger  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:52):**  that we get some exceptionally good work in some parts of the country, and then perhaps  
**[0:24:57-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:24:57):**  nothing at all in other parts of the country. Is that a concern? Well, stuff has to be done,  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:03):**  and someone has to do it, right. And they can either do it in monopolies, like they  
**[0:25:07-0:25:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:07):**  do at the moment in water companies, or they can do it where other ideas and other people  
**[0:25:13-0:25:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:13):**  come into the frame. So in my world, you take a catchment, and you say, okay, so what are  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:18):**  the outcomes we want in the most general sense, you know, what is the quality of the biodiversity  
**[0:25:24-0:25:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:24):**  we want? What is the carbon sequestration we want, etc. And you then say, right, so  
**[0:25:30-0:25:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:30):**  let's put those outcomes up on the system architects website for anyone to challenge.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:38):**  So you build a citizen's community, bring everyone on board to discuss what is a reasonable  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:44):**  set of objectives, given the Agricultural Act, the Climate Change Amendment Act, and  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:49):**  the Environment Act, right. So you've got a late legal framework outside. So people  
**[0:25:53-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:53):**  will come up and say, you know, I've got different ideas about this, then you say, well, we refine  
**[0:25:58-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:25:58):**  that, like any practical process, this is what we want to achieve. And these are things  
**[0:26:02-0:26:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:02):**  that need to be done. And you ask people to do it, you can ask state employees to do it,  
**[0:26:05-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:05):**  you can ask monopolists to do it, or you can ask AN other people as well to say, could  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:10):**  they do it better. So you have to have a system regulator, the architect, who adjudicates  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:16):**  on this, they have to award the contracts. So even on the nationalised industries, you  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:20):**  know, the CGP didn't build power stations, they put them out of contract. Now, some people  
**[0:26:25-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:25):**  might do the job well, and some people might do the job badly. Some people might offer  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:29):**  a cheap price, but a bad outcome, right, and some people might offer. That's for the system  
**[0:26:35-0:26:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:35):**  regulator to determine. But I put it to you that not allowing other people to the table,  
**[0:26:41-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:41):**  not allowing other people to challenge, for example, the water companies, not allowing  
**[0:26:46-0:26:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:46):**  new innovations to come forward is not likely to produce good outcomes. And let's be honest,  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:52):**  it doesn't. The agricultural subsidy regime separate from the water regulatory regime,  
**[0:26:58-0:27:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:26:58):**  as it's currently put in place, separate from the flood defence produces a lousy outcome.  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:04):**  We can do much better. We can improve the productivity of farming in the process, we  
**[0:27:09-0:27:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:09):**  can improve the biodiversity, and never mind about we need more money, we just want to  
**[0:27:14-0:27:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:14):**  spend the existing money a lot better than we currently do, then we can think about whether  
**[0:27:19-0:27:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:19):**  there's a case for more. But right now, you couldn't do it worse.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:23):**  World Finance, thinking about the future again, I wonder if you expect there to be greater  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:28):**  food and farming diversity in Britain as a result of these changes, and as we move forward  
**[0:27:33-0:27:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:33):**  over the course of the next two or three decades? Or whether you expect there to be an increase  
**[0:27:37-0:27:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:37):**  in food monocultures?  
**[0:27:38-0:27:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:38):**  Well, let me preface my remarks by what's really changing in agriculture is the advances  
**[0:27:47-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:47):**  in science and technology. Okay, so the two big changes which are out of the box are the  
**[0:27:53-0:28:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:27:53):**  digitalisation of agriculture, and genetics. So the digitalisation enables extraordinary  
**[0:28:01-0:28:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:01):**  possibilities. It enables the ability to be able to analyse in real time exactly what  
**[0:28:08-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:08):**  the drill bit and the spray is doing. It enables in real time, with a satellite going around  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:13):**  all the time, to see exactly what's happening on any piece of land. And it enables robotics  
**[0:28:19-0:28:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:19):**  and automation, etc. This cannot do anything else than improve productivity, and it can  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:28):**  make it much easier to achieve environmental targets than otherwise would be the case.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:33):**  You know, you can think why we have such low agricultural productivity is because basically,  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:38):**  who needs to invest in a robot when you can get loads of cheap Eastern European labour?  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:43):**  And there's a real issue there, which some of the brexiteers got right, but now don't  
**[0:28:48-0:28:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:48):**  understand the consequences, but they now don't have any fruit pickers. And so they  
**[0:28:52-0:28:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:52):**  do have to invest in the technology. And that's a big wake up call. Genetics, whether you  
**[0:28:58-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:28:58):**  believe in gene editing, etc, etc. And I understand that's entirely, that's very controversial.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:03):**  Our understanding of what's going on in agriculture is much greater. For example, whether you  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:10):**  think that gene editing is an answer to avian flu in the next 10 or 15 years is a really  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:15):**  open question. But you do know exactly what avian flu is because you can analyse the genetics  
**[0:29:20-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:20):**  of the virus. So there's big steps forward. So my take is that this technology will combine  
**[0:29:28-0:29:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:28):**  to lead to much higher output from a much smaller amount of land. So the limits of this  
**[0:29:36-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:36):**  is to think about what indoor farming is. Go visit the Hutton Institute in Dundee. You  
**[0:29:42-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:42):**  know, this is an entirely indoor activity. It's completely organic, it completely recycles  
**[0:29:50-0:29:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:50):**  the water, and it's entirely reliant on renewable energy. If you look at some of the protein  
**[0:29:56-0:30:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:29:56):**  approaches, you know, in a small insect factory in a warehouse on an industrial state in France,  
**[0:30:05-0:30:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:05):**  you can produce more protein than vast areas of upland estates in Scotland, you know, and  
**[0:30:10-0:30:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:10):**  in the end, it's protein that people want. So I envisage a world in which we probably  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:15):**  won't need all this land, and we will use much more science. And you think about it,  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:20):**  it's a very odd idea to plant stuff outside and leave it to the vagaries of the droughts,  
**[0:30:26-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:26):**  the flood and the weather. So I think that rather than being, you know, hostile to this,  
**[0:30:34-0:30:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:34):**  many people on the more green side of these discussions ought to embrace the possibility  
**[0:30:41-0:30:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:41):**  that we could have much better use of land. We're stopping grazing sheep on peat bogs,  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:46):**  right? What is the point of one sheep per five acres, which is all subsidized, and then  
**[0:30:53-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:53):**  exported, etc. You know, there are so many better things we can do. And this comes back  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:30:58):**  down to making the technology work in line with our views about how the land use might  
**[0:31:05-0:31:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:05):**  go.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:06):**  One of the things that we talk about a lot on this podcast is agroecology and regenerative  
**[0:31:10-0:31:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:10):**  agriculture. And the idea that actually one of the cheapest and most efficient ways of  
**[0:31:15-0:31:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:15):**  managing land is to make sure that the food production is well integrated with nature  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:20):**  and that the livestock and the way that the food is being produced is actually delivering  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:25):**  those land outcomes, those natural capital outcomes that we've talked about in the past.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:29):**  And when we think about, you know, economics in the same way as environmentalism, for me,  
**[0:31:36-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:36):**  the idea of environmental and economic resilience comes from having a broad array of businesses,  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:42):**  whether some of those are indoors, some of those are outdoors, some of those are small,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:46):**  some of those are large, some are selling into major retailers, perhaps, or exporting  
**[0:31:50-0:31:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:50):**  and others producing much more directly for the general public. Is that a vision that  
**[0:31:55-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:31:55):**  you would accept and that you would think was a good thing? Does that sort of fit with  
**[0:32:00-0:32:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:00):**  your vision of less land being more productive and a greater use of technology?  
**[0:32:06-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:06):**  So, I'm sort of allergic to labels. So, I think people say, oh, let's do re-wilding.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:13):**  And then you dig in and you realise what they actually have in mind or don't really have  
**[0:32:19-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:19):**  in mind. Regenerative agriculture is the latest buzz. Pastures for Life is a very good organisation.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:27):**  And I kind of got sympathy with people who, you know, want to make the land more nature-friendly  
**[0:32:33-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:33):**  or they really care about the regenerative characteristics of the soil and integrating  
**[0:32:38-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:38):**  animals and so on and so forth. But the idea that what we need is diversity of farming  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:46):**  activity, that's, you can see why it sort of appeals. Who would be against diversity,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:51):**  right? But let me put it the other way. I really care about every hectare, right? And  
**[0:32:56-0:33:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:32:56):**  I want to know what's happening in every hectare. I don't want an apartheid in which there's  
**[0:33:01-0:33:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:01):**  some very chemical intensive agriculture. But don't worry, we've got some nice stuff  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:07):**  elsewhere. It's like people say, you know, we've got lovely field margin, usually mowed  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:11):**  to the last centimetre. But a nice field margin. But in the middle, we're concentrating on  
**[0:33:16-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:16):**  just killing everything else but the crop, down to glyphosate in the stuff just before  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:22):**  we harvest it so that we can all enjoy glyphosate in the food chain, right? I put that aside.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:27):**  But you know, you know that kind of argument. And so let's give up on the kind of, you know,  
**[0:33:33-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:33):**  Peterborough, you know, area to the east. Let's just accept they're just industrial  
**[0:33:40-0:33:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:40):**  intensive chemical activities. But hey, we've got some nice things in Exmoor. This is completely  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:46):**  wrong. We don't want diversity in the sense of some pollute doing nasty pollution, and  
**[0:33:52-0:33:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:52):**  some people doing nice things. We want all the land properly managed, right? And, you  
**[0:33:57-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:33:57):**  know, one of the themes that the regenerative movement pursues, which I'm very sympathetic  
**[0:34:03-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:03):**  to, they worry a lot about soils, and what's been done to them. And they're right. Okay.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:09):**  So soil has roughly four times the carbon of the atmosphere. It's much more important  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:14):**  as a carbon store than the atmosphere above us. Okay. And the ripping out of that carbon  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:19):**  into the atmosphere is deadly for climate change. And this isn't properly measured.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:24):**  And that's why, you know, the emissions targets, etc, are very, very imperfect. It turns out  
**[0:34:30-0:34:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:30):**  that carbon in the soil is a very good proxy for biodiversity. Most biodiversity is beneath  
**[0:34:35-0:34:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:35):**  our feet, not the sort of nice little tigers and wolves and beavers that people get terribly  
**[0:34:40-0:34:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:40):**  excited about. I often get excited about them too, but that's not the bulk of biodiversity.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:44):**  All in under our feet. And the amount of carbon in the soil is a good proxy for that. And  
**[0:34:49-0:34:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:49):**  by the way, the amount of carbon in the soil is a good proxy for the sustainability of  
**[0:34:53-0:34:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:53):**  yielding crops going forward. Win, win, win. I've got you three wins, okay? The trouble  
**[0:34:59-0:35:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:34:59):**  is, we have a system of support, which doesn't really reflect those. So there's no benefit  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:04):**  for managing soil to increase biodiversity. There is a yet no benefit for managing soil  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:10):**  to keep carbon in. The no till stuff works because people can use lots of glyphosate.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:15):**  And it's low cost because they can use glyphosate rather than ploughs and the traditional ways  
**[0:35:20-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:20):**  of doing things. So holistically looking at every hectare of land in Britain, and making  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:26):**  sure every hectare of land is being managed in an appropriate way to bequeath those core  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:33):**  assets going forward is what matters. Remember, farming is the industry that most depends  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:39):**  on natural capital. It is the natural capital industry. And abusing your assets is like  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:45):**  not putting the tiles back on the roof when the wind takes them off. It's not repairing  
**[0:35:50-0:35:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:50):**  the building. And, you know, that's about short term and long term. And we need to incentivise  
**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:35:55):**  that. So I don't like labels. I've never fitted in any camp, just I never fit in any political  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:00):**  affiliation or whatever. I like to look at the fundamentals and think, what is it we  
**[0:36:06-0:36:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:06):**  actually want to achieve?  
**[0:36:07-0:36:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:07):**  I want to move on to another topic in just a second. But just before we do, there are  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:11):**  lots of reports now from Idri looking at Europe as a whole to some of the work, the farming  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:17):**  smarter work that the Food Farming and Countryside Commission has been involved in. And they're  
**[0:36:21-0:36:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:21):**  looking at the way in which every hectare could be improved, every hectare could be  
**[0:36:26-0:36:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:26):**  used to manage natural capital well at the same time as producing food. But in order  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:32):**  to deliver that, there needs to be dietary change. And I wonder whether that's something  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:36):**  that you think the state should take a lead on or whether it's something the market should  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:41):**  lead on. And whether when you think about dietary change, you're thinking about the  
**[0:36:46-0:36:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:46):**  introduction of more lab-based nutrition and food replacements, or whether you're thinking  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:51):**  in terms of a greater diversity of vegetables and pulses, grains, as well as, you know,  
**[0:36:56-0:36:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:56):**  the meat and eggs and dairy that people are eating.  
**[0:36:58-0:37:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:36:58):**  OK, so the dietary issue, it's various dimensions. I always worry about the state telling people  
**[0:37:05-0:37:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:05):**  what to eat. It's usually counterproductive. And there is a question about individual freedom.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:11):**  And if you want to eat yourself to death, you know, just like you might want to smoke  
**[0:37:14-0:37:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:14):**  yourself to death, that's your problem. The difficulty comes when we as a society have  
**[0:37:19-0:37:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:19):**  to take the consequences of the choices that people make. So if you look at the obesity  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:25):**  crisis, if you look at the cost of a health service, if you look at the damage to the  
**[0:37:30-0:37:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:30):**  productivity in the economy from people being ill and overweight, if you look at even in  
**[0:37:34-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:34):**  the Covid case, how much damage was done by people who were effectively on, quote, the  
**[0:37:40-0:37:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:40):**  wrong diets, we as a society all have to pay the price for the choices that people make.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:46):**  That's the first thing. The second thing is that the food that people eat is the result  
**[0:37:52-0:37:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:52):**  of masses of advertising that's thrown at them. And most of the advertising, dare I  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:37:57):**  say, is for junk. So if you look at the TV adverts, if you look at the, you know, the  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:02):**  sponsors of TV programmes, all this kind of stuff, all the social media things, you know,  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:07):**  people are being given seriously bad information all the time. And it is the job of the state  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:13):**  to stop promoters of junk lying to people. And I mean that really seriously. Okay. And  
**[0:38:19-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:19):**  so it is right for the state to intervene in this area. Now, it's a completely separate  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:25):**  argument to say that people make choices about what they eat, which have carbon emission  
**[0:38:30-0:38:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:30):**  consequences. And I'm in favour of people paying for the pollution they cause. I believe  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:36):**  it's individuals, us as consumers who cause pollution. Companies just do it for us. You  
**[0:38:42-0:38:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:42):**  know, it's not the evil oil companies that are digging up oil for fun. It's the fact  
**[0:38:47-0:38:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:47):**  that 80% of our economy is fossil fuels, and we're using it in everything we do. So I think  
**[0:38:51-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:51):**  that it is absolutely right that the state should intervene on dietary matters. I think  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:38:58):**  it should start in school. I'm appalled that kids have no idea what food is or how to cook  
**[0:39:03-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:03):**  it or to do any of those component parts, let alone from the sheer pleasure of knowing  
**[0:39:07-0:39:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:07):**  how to cook, which is just great fun. They have no idea about gardening. They have no  
**[0:39:13-0:39:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:13):**  idea about the food chain. You know, how do you design a curriculum for the young, for  
**[0:39:20-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:20):**  the next generation, without incorporating these basic building blocks of life? Because  
**[0:39:26-0:39:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:26):**  I'm in favour of that. I'm in favour of carbon taxes, a carbon price on all and everything.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:31):**  And I'm in favour, going beyond that, of taxing some of the serious externalities. So it's

**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:44):**  Whether we should tax meat, right, for carbon reasons, I think that's very, very questionable  
**[0:39:51-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:51):**  because when you really think about meat, it's not the meat that's the problem from  
**[0:39:58-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:39:58):**  a carbon point of view. It's what sort of meat. And if you really want to tax meat,  
**[0:40:04-0:40:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:04):**  you have to recognise that each location has a whole set of different natural capital issues  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:10):**  associated, including carbon. And it's great. You get rid of all the cattle, plough up all  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:15):**  the fields, glyphosate them all. You haven't got the grass sequestering carbon anymore.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:21):**  It's very easy to make things worse. So I'm very, very suspicious of that.  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:25):**  And of course, you know, when we look at meat more generally, it's pigs and chickens that  
**[0:40:30-0:40:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:30):**  have a much greater impact on the environment than cattle that have been produced in a more  
**[0:40:35-0:40:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:35):**  regenerative grazing system. And it's like my comment about not liking  
**[0:40:41-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:41):**  terms like rewilding or regenerative, you know, vegetarianism, veganism, right? And  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:47):**  they become religions. Dieter, we're starting to run out of time  
**[0:40:50-0:40:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:50):**  and there are a few other topics that I'd like to get on to. And the next is one that  
**[0:40:54-0:40:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:54):**  I think a lot of farmers have raised over the course of the last few years of conversation.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:40:59):**  And one that I think it's important just to go into at least briefly at this point. Now,  
**[0:41:03-0:41:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:03):**  public money for public goods is of course a fundamental pillar of the cap reform in  
**[0:41:08-0:41:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:08):**  England. And we've talked about things like the maintenance of soil health, improved biodiversity  
**[0:41:13-0:41:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:13):**  water cycling in the countryside. Why is food itself not thought of as a public good?  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:19):**  Well, because it's a private good. What does that mean?  
**[0:41:21-0:41:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:21):**  A public good is something that's non-rival and non-excludable. Okay, so if you turn on  
**[0:41:27-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:27):**  the BBC, right, your consumption won't affect anyone else's consumption. And unless you're  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:33):**  forced to pay a license fee, they can't stop you listening to it. If you buy a bag of flour,  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:38):**  right, and you use it, I can't. That's rivalry. Okay. And is it excludable? Yeah, you can  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:43):**  stop me having it. You can sell it to someone else. It's a market good. So that's the fundamental  
**[0:41:48-0:41:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:48):**  point. Okay. And the idea is that basically, why should we pay people to produce private  
**[0:41:54-0:41:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:54):**  goods for their private benefit, as opposed to pay people to produce public goods which  
**[0:41:59-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:41:59):**  would not be produced in the market properly because the incentives are never there because  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:03):**  it's non-excludable and non-rival. Now, what's confused is the idea that something might  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:07):**  be in the public interest. It probably is in the public interest that Mars produces  
**[0:42:13-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:13):**  Mars bottles or whatever, right? The loads of things that are public interest which are  
**[0:42:18-0:42:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:18):**  not public goods, okay? And if farmers are paid the proper price after the cost of pollution,  
**[0:42:24-0:42:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:24):**  etc, for what they produce, the market should equate that. And the reason they don't, markets  
**[0:42:30-0:42:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:30):**  don't work their way is because they're so distorted by the policy frames. Now, when  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:33):**  it comes to the great claim, we've got to produce food, okay, it then leads to this  
**[0:42:38-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:38):**  argument, okay, we've got to be self-sufficient, right? And you think, really? Right? So, if  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:43):**  you meant that you had to be self-sufficient, that food was really matter, you would look  
**[0:42:47-0:42:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:47):**  around a lot of the land that farmers farm, which is not producing food, okay? Go to Exmoor,  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:53):**  in the middle of Exmoor, the most profitable thing to do is run pheasant shoots. And I'm  
**[0:42:57-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:42:57):**  not against pheasant shoots or whatever, but that isn't land producing food. A lot of it  
**[0:43:01-0:43:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:01):**  goes into landfill. If you look at lots of lands that's used for all sorts of other activity,  
**[0:43:07-0:43:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:07):**  I mean, golf courses, horses, all sorts of stuff. I mean, rightly, we use land for lots  
**[0:43:11-0:43:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:11):**  of purposes. And rightly, farmers do all sorts of things which are not for anaerobic digesters  
**[0:43:17-0:43:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:17):**  growing maize for these things, right? That isn't food. So, if you really meant it, and  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:21):**  if you really were worried about food security, it's quite straightforward, stop exporting.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:26):**  Do you have a definition of food security?  
**[0:43:28-0:43:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:28):**  Food security is like energy security, like fibre security is, you know, what is the risk  
**[0:43:36-0:43:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:36):**  that there will be a physical shortage of food supply? And then the question is, how  
**[0:43:42-0:43:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:42):**  best to mitigate that? So, the risk of a shortage of food supply is pretty low, extremely low,  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:49):**  even during COVID, a few things were off the shelf, but the risk is very low. If you wanted  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:53):**  to enhance food security, so you're worried about, I don't know, you know, the Second  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:43:59):**  World War and the convoys and all that stuff, I mean, as if you'd have 10 minutes to when  
**[0:44:04-0:44:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:04):**  the fibre networks are done and all agriculture collapses pretty quickly, right? You know,  
**[0:44:10-0:44:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:10):**  if you, if that's what you're concerned about, then yes, do certain things, right? Stop exports,  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:18):**  put exports controls in immediately, big for victory and all that kind of stuff. We are  
**[0:44:23-0:44:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:23):**  a million miles away from that. And by the way, you need to build some fertiliser factories,  
**[0:44:27-0:44:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:27):**  you need to build some tractor factories. In fact, nearly all of the substantive infrastructure  
**[0:44:33-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:33):**  around agriculture is imported. And when you say that you're going to, you know, you're  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:38):**  going to interfere with the trade, remember, you know, as many farmers discovered, you  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:42):**  know, they used to think it was great to sell stuff into Europe without trade barriers.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:46):**  It's different now. So, if you meant it, and A, I think that you would basically spend  
**[0:44:51-0:44:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:51):**  all the money on fibre security, because you know, the whole thing would crack without  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:55):**  broadband infrastructure. Look what happened in Stormor when up in the north, when the  
**[0:44:59-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:44:59):**  power went down, for 10 days, nobody could do anything, your robots wouldn't work, your  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:04):**  phone won't even work, right? Because it's voice over internet, nothing functions without  
**[0:45:10-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:10):**  those basic infrastructures. Similarly, you can't function if you haven't got water supply.  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:13):**  So, you really have to think this problem through seriously and just slug slogan, food  
**[0:45:18-0:45:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:18):**  security good, food good, you know, everything else bad, there's like four legs good, two  
**[0:45:22-0:45:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:22):**  legs bad and the animal farm all over again. It's just naive.  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:26):**  And so, food security is as much as anything about system resilience, whether that system  
**[0:45:30-0:45:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:30):**  is in relation to trade, or whether it's those earlier sort of infrastructural systems that  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:35):**  we were talking about from natural capital through to cable infrastructure.

**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:42):**  What do we need to have a resilient agriculture? Resilient soils, resilient water systems,  
**[0:45:49-0:45:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:49):**  resilient catchments. We need a whole chunk of it. We actually need resilient rural communities  
**[0:45:54-0:45:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:54):**  as well. All of those things have a public good element. But the food itself is a private  
**[0:45:59-0:46:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:45:59):**  good. And even the most ardent advocates of subsidy in the old fashioned sense recognise  
**[0:46:07-0:46:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:46:07):**  that it's not.

**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:46:26):**  is potentially pulled from pillar to post? And if not, are there new mechanisms that

**[0:46:47-0:46:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:46:47):**  it needed replacing and things needed to be done. And that's a great benefit of Brexit.

**[0:47:12-0:47:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:12):**  look at them, the way it was going under Truss as the negotiator for this stuff, before Truss  
**[0:47:18-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:18):**  as Prime Minister, what people were advocating was free trade. And what free trade is, is  
**[0:47:23-0:47:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:23):**  not fair trade. It's highly distorted. In her free trade world, it was readily admitted  
**[0:47:30-0:47:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:30):**  that farmers could find themselves exposed to competition from imports produced under  
**[0:47:37-0:47:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:37):**  much lower welfare conditions, and much worse environmental conditions domestically and  
**[0:47:42-0:47:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:42):**  get wiped out to the detriment of farming here and to the detriment of the planet. The  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:48):**  traditional argument is, well, agriculture is not very important. The car industry and  
**[0:47:52-0:47:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:52):**  manufacturing is. All trade deals end up having a row about agriculture. But basically, in  
**[0:47:58-0:48:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:47:58):**  the end, agriculture gets sacrificed for the greater trading good of the nation. I think  
**[0:48:03-0:48:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:03):**  this is terrible. And this is why I'm in favour of carbon border taxes. So you should pay  
**[0:48:07-0:48:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:07):**  the carbon. But I'm also in favour of British farmers paying for the carbon. So it works  
**[0:48:11-0:48:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:11):**  both ways here. I'm in favour of, yes, very coherent and strong welfare standards. And  
**[0:48:16-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:16):**  I'm in favour of wider environmental standards too. I do not want beef raised on cleared  
**[0:48:23-0:48:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:23):**  bits of the Amazon rainforest, taking out a hill farmers in Wales or Scotland. And I  
**[0:48:30-0:48:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:30):**  don't want high intensity carbon polluting grain and other products produced in Brazil  
**[0:48:38-0:48:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:38):**  and elsewhere, taking out stuff produced in the UK, where there's a legitimate difference.  
**[0:48:44-0:48:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:44):**  So I'm in favour of trade, I'm in favour of competition. But, you know, we start from  
**[0:48:48-0:48:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:48):**  the wrong place where we say we want a free trade agreement with America. And let's be  
**[0:48:52-0:48:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:52):**  honest, you know, for all the noise about free trade after Brexit, okay, so what have  
**[0:48:57-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:48:57):**  we got? Some sort of deal with New Zealand, some sort of deal with Australia, no deal  
**[0:49:03-0:49:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:03):**  with the United States in prospect, which is the big one. And actually, everything else  
**[0:49:07-0:49:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:07):**  just reproduces what the EU had in place in the first instance. So, so far, it hasn't  
**[0:49:12-0:49:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:12):**  been bad. But the possibilities are really threatening to our countryside and our land  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:18):**  and to the farmers in it. And I think that rather than being anti trade, one needs to  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:23):**  be pro what I call genuinely efficient, fair trade and not to include environmental costs  
**[0:49:30-0:49:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:30):**  is to be inefficient and carbons where I'd start.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:33):**  So talk to us about that carbon border tax, that that adjustment levy that I think you've  
**[0:49:38-0:49:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:38):**  spoken about before, how would that work in practice? And are there examples in the world  
**[0:49:43-0:49:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:43):**  of where it's already working?  
**[0:49:44-0:49:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:44):**  Okay, so remember that we have carbon territorial production targets. So all our net zero is  
**[0:49:51-0:49:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:51):**  about reducing carbon emissions in Britain. So for example, and carbon equipment, including  
**[0:49:56-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:49:56):**  methane, so slaughter all the cattle, slaughter all the sheep, import it all from Brazil,  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:01):**  and our emissions will fall and we'll have done better. You can see the craziness of  
**[0:50:05-0:50:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:05):**  this, right? So any serious net zero target has to be based on carbon consumption, regardless  
**[0:50:12-0:50:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:12):**  of where the stuff is produced, because carbon knows no boundaries. So I'm in favour of,  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:17):**  I mean, it'll never happen, but it's the most efficient outcome. And you need to have it  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:21):**  in mind when you think about the practicality. I'm in favour of the same carbon price applied  
**[0:50:25-0:50:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:25):**  to agriculture, electricity, heating, transport, everything, right. And I'm in favour of that  
**[0:50:32-0:50:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:32):**  price applying at the border. So imagine a ship arrives at, I don't know, Southampton  
**[0:50:37-0:50:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:37):**  docks or somewhere, and it's full of, let's make it easy, steel, but it could be full  
**[0:50:43-0:50:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:43):**  of animal carcasses or whatever. So it comes from China, we've closed our steel mills down,  
**[0:50:48-0:50:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:48):**  we import the stuff from China, and the ship arrives at the docks, and the customer official,  
**[0:50:53-0:50:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:53):**  when they're not on the beaches dealing with people coming across the channel, goes up  
**[0:50:57-0:51:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:50:57):**  to the ship captain and says, so you know, can you pay your carbon due? You know, it's  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:01):**  steel, this is the rate, and the ship captain says, she says, well, can I get out of this  
**[0:51:07-0:51:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:07):**  please? Is it any way I can avoid paying this? So yeah, give us an exemption certificate,  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:11):**  show me you pay the carbon tax domestically back in China for the amount. And either way,  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:16):**  it doesn't matter where the carbon tax is paid for the carbon, it has the same effect,  
**[0:51:20-0:51:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:20):**  right, because it makes the price of the carbon in the steel coming in the UK the same price  
**[0:51:24-0:51:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:24):**  as the steel produced in the UK from a carbon perspective. And of course, the great advantage  
**[0:51:29-0:51:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:29):**  of this is you start to create a coalition of the unilateral willing on carbon. So if  
**[0:51:36-0:51:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:36):**  the United States did this, which is toying with, and if the EU did it, which there's  
**[0:51:41-0:51:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:41):**  a clear proposal to pursue that, that's 40% plus of world trade, you'd be sure as hell  
**[0:51:47-0:51:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:47):**  China would have a carbon tax, India would have a carbon tax, everyone would go for a  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:51):**  carbon tax, because you'd rather pay your own government rather than the Chinese pay  
**[0:51:56-0:52:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:51:56):**  the British government, right? It's a no brainer. Then you've got a more global carbon tax in  
**[0:52:02-0:52:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:02):**  place. And then, contrary to the whole COP process, something on the ground will actually  
**[0:52:08-0:52:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:08):**  happen.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:09):**  Now you've talked about the US being interested there, the European Union being interested  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:13):**  in carbon border taxes. Are you getting any traction at all? Are you seeing any traction  
**[0:52:18-0:52:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:18):**  in terms of the UK? Because I think there's a lot of support outside of government. Is  
**[0:52:22-0:52:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:22):**  there support inside government for this?  
**[0:52:24-0:52:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:24):**  Well, of course, you know, it's a tricky question, because we've had three different prime ministers  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:28):**  in the space of a few weeks, there was no support in a trust government for this. Johnson  
**[0:52:33-0:52:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:33):**  cakeism meant that you could be in favour of all sorts of things, but and signal that  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:39):**  you're on everyone's side. But dealing with the practicality was never I think, I think,  
**[0:52:44-0:52:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:44):**  I think even Boris Johnson said never his forte. Will the Sunak government go there?  
**[0:52:50-0:52:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:50):**  I don't know. I mean, we're in this cost of living crisis, everyone's very focused on  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:55):**  the here and now, people will scream about, oh, that means prices will go up for some  
**[0:52:59-0:53:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:52:59):**  of the imported stuff we have. You can see all the short term objections. But, you know,  
**[0:53:05-0:53:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:05):**  again, I'm an optimist, okay, and on two grounds. First of all, I'm an optimist about carbon  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:11):**  taxes, because in the end, the government will run out of every other source of money.  
**[0:53:15-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:15):**  So we'll do it because they need the money. Regardless of the environmental argument,  
**[0:53:19-0:53:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:19):**  I don't care why they do it. I just want the right answer. But I'm optimistic too, because  
**[0:53:24-0:53:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:24):**  without doing this, we ain't going to crack climate change. And if you look at the way  
**[0:53:28-0:53:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:28):**  the dictators are going in China and Russia and elsewhere, basically, they're never going  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:33):**  to come to the table and a cop and agree to what what would be sensible to achieve climate  
**[0:53:37-0:53:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:37):**  change. So the question is, how do you force them to play ball? And we can't have a world  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:42):**  in which some major polluters don't face the price of carbon, but we make British and European  
**[0:53:49-0:53:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:49):**  and indeed in due course American companies pay these costs. It's like making farmers  
**[0:53:55-0:54:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:53:55):**  pay for or start culling the cattle in order to import the stuff from Brazil. And that's  
**[0:54:01-0:54:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:54:01):**  my ultimate piece of optimism. In the end, you can try all the other alternatives, but  
**[0:54:07-0:54:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:54:07):**  ideas are powerful. And in the end, the analysis sees through all the lobbying fog. And that's  
**[0:54:14-0:54:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:54:14):**  why we got the Environment Act. That's why the 25 year plan was accepted because it was  
**[0:54:19-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:54:19):**  the right idea for a green and prosperous Britain. And similarly in this carbon area,  
**[0:54:25-0:54:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:54:25):**  we've tried everything else. It hasn't worked. So we actually have to get serious. Do you  
**[0:54:29-0:54:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/The-one-with-Prof-Sir-Dieter-Helm-CBE-e1q7v9i#t=0:54:29):**  want three degrees? Or do you actually want to do something about this? And again, you

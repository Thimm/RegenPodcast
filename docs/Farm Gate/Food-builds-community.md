### Farm Gate  (Mon, 05 Jul 2021 09:42:32)
**[0:00:00-0:00:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Land Unlocked, a collaboration from the Food Farming and Countryside Commission  
**[0:00:10-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:10):**  and the Farmgate podcast. I'm Finnlow Costayne, the chief executive of Farmwell, and in this  
**[0:00:15-0:00:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:15):**  series, I'm talking about land use, with influential figures from the UK and around  
**[0:00:19-0:00:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:19):**  the world in the run-up to COP26 in Glasgow this November. In this programme, we focus  
**[0:00:24-0:00:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:24):**  on the power and importance of communities and community-led change. While governments  
**[0:00:30-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:30):**  and businesses play a critical role in addressing the climate emergency, there is also an urgent  
**[0:00:35-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:35):**  need to cede power and resources to ordinary people so that they can design and deliver  
**[0:00:41-0:00:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:41):**  the changes necessary in their own lives and in their neighbourhoods. Poverty in particular  
**[0:00:46-0:00:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:46):**  remains a significant barrier for all governments in achieving net zero, and community-led projects,  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:51):**  for example centred on food, electricity, transport, leisure and energy efficiency can  
**[0:00:56-0:01:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:00:56):**  all deliver carbon reductions while also rewarding people with a lower cost of living and the  
**[0:01:02-0:01:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:02):**  experience and confidence to work together for even greater change. We have a busy panel  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:07):**  of guests today. James Goodman is director of partnerships and learning for the local  
**[0:01:12-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:12):**  trust. Brian E. Boyle is the administrator of the Big Local Project in Selby in North  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:16):**  Yorkshire. Chris Blake is founding director of the Green Valleys, a community interest  
**[0:01:21-0:01:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:21):**  company based in the Brecon Beacons in Wales, and a catalyst behind Project Skyline. Welcome  
**[0:01:27-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:27):**  all. Hello. James, let me come to you first, if I may. What is the local trust and what's  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:34):**  the Big Local Project? Hi there. It's great to be on the programme. Local Trust is a charity  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:39):**  that was set up about 10 years ago by National Lottery with a significant endowment to spend  
**[0:01:45-0:01:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:45):**  basically directly on communities. The main thing that Local Trust does is it coordinates  
**[0:01:50-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:50):**  a big local programme and a way of thinking about the Big Local Programme is it is a major  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:01:55):**  experiment in simply trusting people in communities to make the best decisions that they can for  
**[0:02:00-0:02:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:00):**  their community to improve where they live. It was designed and come up with as a way  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:04):**  of getting money into communities that weren't, that perhaps were missing out on funds in  
**[0:02:10-0:02:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:10):**  the past, that weren't applying for grants from the Lottery or weren't successful in  
**[0:02:14-0:02:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:14):**  applying for grants. And so rather than asking people to participate in competitive grant  
**[0:02:20-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:20):**  application processes and so on, which can be quite difficult and excluding, the Lottery  
**[0:02:24-0:02:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:24):**  said, well, why don't we just give people the money? And so a million pounds is allocated  
**[0:02:28-0:02:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:28):**  to each of 150 local neighbourhoods across England. So when you say an experiment and  
**[0:02:33-0:02:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:33):**  a bit of money, that's a, that is a big experiment and a big load of money. It's a bold experiment  
**[0:02:39-0:02:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:39):**  that we're learning from, trusting people with power, resources and time to make decisions  
**[0:02:43-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:43):**  and shape their own communities. We're learning that it works. And so that's quite convenient  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:47):**  for the, for the experiment. It was also, you know, definitely an investment in building  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:52):**  community. So yeah, there's a million pounds to spend in 150 places across England, the  
**[0:02:57-0:03:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:02:57):**  places are neighbourhood level. So in contrast, a lot of local work, which tends to sort of  
**[0:03:01-0:03:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:01):**  stop at the local authority level, these are neighbourhoods population around 8,000 real  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:06):**  communities and tending also to be in the top 20% of wards communities in the index  
**[0:03:12-0:03:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:12):**  and multiple deprivation as well. They're on average more deprived than the average  
**[0:03:17-0:03:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:17):**  in England.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:18):**  And I'm guessing that these communities also are the communities that tend to be pretty  
**[0:03:22-0:03:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:22):**  avid players of the National Lottery.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:24):**  Yes, that's right. So that's another paradox is that people are playing the Lottery and  
**[0:03:28-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:28):**  putting money into this amazing resource, but that resource wasn't necessarily getting  
**[0:03:33-0:03:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:33):**  back to the communities. So it's a way of tackling that.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:36):**  Dryony, clearly, you know, Big Local is a magnificent idea. It's a really quite remarkable  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:42):**  experiment. You actually managed the project in Selby. So how does it work in practice?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:47):**  I think one of the things that's so special about Big Local is that every Big Local area  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:52):**  in England is totally different. So each place is shaped by the place itself, the people  
**[0:03:59-0:04:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:03:59):**  that live there and the priorities that they identify. And I think that is one thing that  
**[0:04:04-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:04):**  makes Big Local really unique. Yet we're all part of a programme where you can get support.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:09):**  In terms of how it works, we have a resident led partnership board. So that's a group of  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:14):**  individuals who are responsible for the decision making. So how that how that million pounds  
**[0:04:19-0:04:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:19):**  is spent. So in Selby, we have about 14 residents from across our area. And as well as residents,  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:26):**  we have a few members of kind of other agencies. So we have representation from, you know,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:31):**  the county council and the district council and the town council. And that partnership  
**[0:04:36-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:36):**  works alongside the volunteers and the workers to talk to residents to deliver activities,  
**[0:04:44-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:44):**  this sort of ongoing resident engagement and development work, what we call a community  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:48):**  action plan. So that's really our framework for delivery for the short and medium term.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:53):**  And we review that every couple of years to sense check that we're doing the things that  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:56):**  residents really say are important to them.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:04:58):**  And in terms of that development plan, I'm curious because you've talked about these  
**[0:05:01-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:01):**  other stakeholders that are in the room kind of, you know, helping out with that. To what  
**[0:05:05-0:05:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:05):**  extent are the ideas and the projects genuinely coming from the community? And to what extent  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:10):**  are they led by these other stakeholders?  
**[0:05:12-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:12):**  I can only speak for Selby, but I have to say in Selby, our other stakeholders are really  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:17):**  there as enablers and sounding boards and to provide local context. You know, the decisions  
**[0:05:22-0:05:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:22):**  really are being led by the residents themselves. And those other stakeholders, along with  
**[0:05:28-0:05:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:28):**  staff are there to support residents and to create conditions whereby we can help residents  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:35):**  identify the issues that are important and then support them to think through what the  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:39):**  solutions might be. And then hopefully kind of to take that through to take action and  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:44):**  create the kind of long term change that Big Local is all about.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:48):**  And obviously you're just working on the one in Selby, but every community is different,  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:52):**  isn't it? Every community has its own needs and understands its own needs better than  
**[0:05:58-0:06:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:05:58):**  any, any sort of broader national, regional stakeholder.  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:01):**  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you're right. You know, you live in a place, you understand  
**[0:06:05-0:06:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:05):**  that place, you have insights, not only your own life, but you know the lives of your,  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:10):**  your neighbours and your colleagues and your friends. And that lived experience enabled  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:15):**  you to have an opinion and a view on what solutions may be appropriate to the issues  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:20):**  that you identify in your area.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:22):**  Yeah, I think that that's absolutely right that local people understand the problems  
**[0:06:26-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:26):**  that they're facing and what the solutions might be. But they also, I think, see things  
**[0:06:30-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:30):**  in a different way from remote public agencies, government and so on, which have a tendency  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:35):**  to silo issues. Think about an issue being a social issue, an environmental issue, a  
**[0:06:40-0:06:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:40):**  mental health issue, a food issue. But when you're actually living the reality, you can  
**[0:06:43-0:06:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:43):**  see actually how everything comes together and is, you know, in a way it's interconnected  
**[0:06:47-0:06:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:47):**  and it's the same thing. Do you get a much more holistic way of working when you're doing  
**[0:06:51-0:06:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:51):**  it in a place, I think?  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:52):**  So on that basis, Bryony, do you think that the community is better at making decisions  
**[0:06:57-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:06:57):**  in the end, having gone through this process and in spending the money that they have more  
**[0:07:02-0:07:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:02):**  effectively than if it was allocated and managed by more traditional charities and agencies  
**[0:07:06-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:06):**  in the local council that James was just mentioning there?  
**[0:07:09-0:07:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:09):**  I think it's a good question. And I think James articulated it really well. I think,  
**[0:07:13-0:07:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:13):**  you know, residents understand the issues facing them and that lived experience, as  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:17):**  I say, kind of enables you to think about what the solutions. I mean, what's different  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:21):**  about Big Local is it sort of marries up or matches that lived experience with money and  
**[0:07:27-0:07:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:27):**  support. But I'd say it's not without its challenges. I mean, the communities that we're  
**[0:07:31-0:07:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:31):**  working in typically have very little history of being listened to or being trusted with  
**[0:07:36-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:36):**  decisions and a million pounds is a lot of money. And our partnership, and I have no  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:43):**  doubt other partnerships, can really feel the pressure to spend that money wisely and  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:47):**  effectively. And I think this is where the Big Local kind of model of having what's called  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:53):**  a local trusted organisation for each Big Local is really important because a lot of  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:07:57):**  partnerships really benefit from what I've called infrastructure support, but essentially  
**[0:08:02-0:08:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:02):**  support to develop skills or confidence or to bring in specialist staff if it's needed  
**[0:08:09-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:09):**  or access, you know, access to partnerships or other organisations that I think, particularly  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:15):**  at the beginning of the journey, is really challenging. So I think we need to kind of  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:19):**  create these sort of platforms where communities can participate on their own terms and that  
**[0:08:25-0:08:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:25):**  lived experience is valued equally to any other professional sort of experience. But  
**[0:08:31-0:08:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:31):**  I think the two together are important.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:33):**  Jason Vale,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:37):**  I  
**[0:08:57-0:09:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:08:57):**  think we can't afford not to wait. Those sorts of shifts need to take place with people  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:01):**  and communities involved and participating. It's not even a question of bringing communities  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:06):**  with. It is a question of designing, redesigning systems so that communities are at the heart  
**[0:09:11-0:09:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:11):**  and are creating that change. So without that, we're not tankering the fundamental change  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:17):**  we need. So we're just skirting around the issue, I think, in a way. It's interesting  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:20):**  you mentioned climate. It's a huge, obviously the issue of the day in many ways. But if  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:26):**  you look across the 150 Big Local areas, it's only a very small minority of areas that are  
**[0:09:31-0:09:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:31):**  actually mentioning it in their action plans and their work plans. I think it's six out  
**[0:09:35-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:35):**  of 150. And those six are doing great stuff. But actually, if you take a step back and  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:40):**  look at what Big Locals are delivering, a lot of it actually aligns with the sorts of  
**[0:09:44-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:44):**  changes you'd want to see as part of the transition to a net zero economy. So 143 out of 150 doing  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:52):**  something on food. That's a big part of what Selby Town is doing. There's almost nothing  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:09:56):**  that connects the Big Local partnerships more than that really. And so there's growing food,  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:01):**  there's educating people about food, there's using food as a way of bringing the community  
**[0:10:05-0:10:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:05):**  together and so on and so forth. It's not explicitly around climate, but it is climate  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:11):**  aligned. And it's the same with natural spaces, natural environment. So that's another priority  
**[0:10:16-0:10:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:16):**  for a lot of Big Local partnerships. There's a lot of sort of taking over bits of land  
**[0:10:20-0:10:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:20):**  from the council and tidying them up, stripping out the layers of litter, the needles and  
**[0:10:24-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:24):**  so on, making sure they're safe places, well lit, good access, people can actually use  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:29):**  them, start connecting with the natural environment in their area. It's not explicitly about climate,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:34):**  but it is climate aligned because it's connecting people to their local spaces and nature. And  
**[0:10:39-0:10:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:39):**  it's making a more resilient local ecosystem. That is absolutely essential if you think  
**[0:10:43-0:10:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:43):**  about what sort of communities we need to navigate effectively the transition, you know.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:49):**  So you're building there, you're building social resilience, you're building the capacity  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:52):**  to take opportunities and navigate change and uncertainty. Basically, you're building  
**[0:10:56-0:10:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:56):**  powerful communities.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:10:57):**  I agree. In Selby, you know, if I think back over the last four or five years, you know,  
**[0:11:02-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:02):**  in every focus bit of engagement we've done, climate change doesn't come up. And it hasn't  
**[0:11:07-0:11:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:07):**  yet. What does come up is fuel bills, access to open space, job insecurity, local skills,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:15):**  what young people are going to do in the future. So all of these issues are connected to that  
**[0:11:21-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:21):**  big issue of climate change. And I think a lot of it is around communication and the  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:26):**  very fact that if you are facing multiple types of hardship, you know, if you are in  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:31):**  financial hardship, you know, you don't have a job. You've got less headspace to think  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:35):**  about global issues because it feels so disappearing. But you can think about the issues that are  
**[0:11:39-0:11:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:39):**  affecting you and your family and your neighbourhood. And it's about those conversations, I think,  
**[0:11:46-0:11:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:46):**  to tie those together into what we might think of as the bigger conversations around climate  
**[0:11:51-0:11:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:51):**  change.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:52):**  James, just coming back to you, when we spoke prior to the podcast, you used a fantastic  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:11:56):**  phrase. You said that we have moved out of the state paradigm into the market paradigm,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:02):**  but now we move into the community paradigm. What did you mean?  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:05):**  Well, community paradigm is actually a phrase, it's not my phrase, it's a phrase that the  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:10):**  think tank New Local came up with. And they, yes, you're right, they observe and they say  
**[0:12:14-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:14):**  that, you know, somewhere around the 1980s, we shifted out of a state paradigm where,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:19):**  you know, you basically, the default is to look to the government to solve problems and  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:24):**  into a market paradigm where the default is to look to the market and the market frameworks  
**[0:12:28-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:28):**  and market incentives and business, particularly big business to do stuff. And that is probably  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:33):**  where we still are. New Locals analysis is, it starts with local public service delivery,  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:39):**  actually. And it argues that demand for public services is massively up because of population  
**[0:12:45-0:12:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:45):**  growth, because of greater complexity to problems and so on. But resources are down. So the  
**[0:12:50-0:12:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:50):**  way we have solving problems and doing things now just cannot sustain that. It's not broken  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:12:55):**  out will be broken soon. And a much more efficient way of doing things would be to shift power  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:00):**  to people and communities to help them shape those solutions in partnership with local  
**[0:13:04-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:04):**  government and local business and so on. So it's not saying everything gets displaced  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:08):**  and so on. It's sort of the community first sort of mindset change. And Brian, he was  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:12):**  talking about earlier how people in their community understand problems and issues and  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:16):**  how they connect. They've got that in depth knowledge and heritage and history and also  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:21):**  care. And, you know, we're discovering how place based problems are, you know, look at  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:26):**  health inequalities and how life expectancy differs from community to community. There's  
**[0:13:31-0:13:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:31):**  so much specificity in problems to place. Do you need a place based response and so  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:36):**  you need communities to be involved in that. So their argument, New Locals argument around  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:40):**  community paradigm, it starts with a public service delivery piece, but you know, it extends  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:44):**  right across the whole levelling up agenda, the response to the climate crisis, the response  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:49):**  to food system transition. So it's a sort of a vision for a new and radical way of doing  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:13:54):**  things where in which we need to devolve power, we need to devolve with determination, basically.  
**[0:14:00-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:00):**  So every nation's different, I guess, but in the UK, the idea is that in the past, we've  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:05):**  looked to the government to sort things out for us. We then changed from a situation where  
**[0:14:09-0:14:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:09):**  government actually, I suppose, during the 80s was taken away to a very great extent  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:13):**  and the market was expected to deliver. And now what we're moving towards is something  
**[0:14:18-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:18):**  which is hopefully more joined up where, you know, the state is still involved. There's  
**[0:14:22-0:14:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:22):**  still a role for the market, but actually it's shifting that power to communities so  
**[0:14:26-0:14:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:26):**  that communities can take responsibility and receive some of the funding that's necessary  
**[0:14:30-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:30):**  to do what they feel that they need to do for their own neighbourhoods. Chris, the big  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:35):**  local project is very much England. You're in Wales and what you're doing is obviously  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:40):**  therefore working under a different system. You're in the Brecon Beacons and you've secured  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:45):**  funding for Project Skyline, which is a fantastic name from the National Lottery. What is it?  
**[0:14:51-0:14:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:51):**  What is Project Skyline?  
**[0:14:52-0:14:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:52):**  What we're trying to do here is not give money to communities. And we're talking about the  
**[0:14:56-0:15:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:14:56):**  same poor communities, the same communities that haven't had a fair break in the recent  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:02):**  years. And we're trying to give productive land assets to communities so that they can  
**[0:15:06-0:15:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:06):**  actually make their own income. And a lot of the same themes about self-determination  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:11):**  and control come in here. But rather than giving cash, we're trying to give land assets.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:16):**  And particularly we're looking at forestry. And we're partly inspired by the Scottish  
**[0:15:20-0:15:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:20):**  Land Reform Movement. There are now over 200 communities in Scotland who actually own land,  
**[0:15:26-0:15:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:26):**  own productive land, which they can use for forestry, for tourism, for energy generation.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:30):**  And that's been an enormous change. And we tried to see whether we could learn from that  
**[0:15:35-0:15:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:35):**  and apply it into the Welsh context. And we're working in the South Wales valleys. We're  
**[0:15:40-0:15:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:40):**  working in some of the poorest communities in the South Wales valleys, the old post-industrial  
**[0:15:44-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:44):**  coal mining areas, where the coal mines went 30, 40, 50 years ago. And the hills are now  
**[0:15:51-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:51):**  covered in forestry, publicly owned forestry. But that forestry has, there's no economic  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:15:55):**  or cultural or social connection between the communities, which are still thousands. One  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:00):**  of the communities we're working with, Trahear but Neronda, is 6,000 people. But there are  
**[0:16:05-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:05):**  no jobs in that forestry. That forestry is managed corporately, publicly, lowest price,  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:11):**  felling tender every 40 years. And there's no connection at all. So what we did with  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:16):**  Skyline was to say, well, we did a feasibility study, first of all, and we just wanted to  
**[0:16:20-0:16:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:20):**  ask four questions. Would communities like some control and state interest in that landscape?  
**[0:16:26-0:16:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:26):**  Are there sustainable business models? Because if you don't, then you don't get away from  
**[0:16:30-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:30):**  this grant dependency. And for me, this is a really big issue and right at the heart  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:34):**  of empowerment. Would communities be best, do a better job for nature? And are there  
**[0:16:38-0:16:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:38):**  good governance models? And I'm pleased at the end of this feasibility study, we worked  
**[0:16:43-0:16:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:43):**  with three communities and we came to a very strong conclusions. Yes, the communities,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:46):**  once they understood what they were talking about, very keen on doing this. There are  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:51):**  sustainable business models around food production, energy generation and forestry. And so you  
**[0:16:57-0:17:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:16:57):**  can create self-sustaining employment and involvement. And one of the things that was  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:01):**  really striking the communities, we didn't use a climate change very well, but they wanted  
**[0:17:05-0:17:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:05):**  a better home for nature. They wanted in the one memorable resident of Merthyr that we  
**[0:17:10-0:17:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:10):**  were working with, he said, so the thing is, Chris, what we need, we need more round trees  
**[0:17:14-0:17:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:14):**  and less pointy trees. And it's simply put, but actually it's a, he didn't say no pointy  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:20):**  trees, because pointy trees are income, it's jobs for the next generation, but he wants  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:25):**  a balance. And I suppose we concluded that local people are the best stewards of landscape  
**[0:17:30-0:17:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:30):**  and of place. And is this one project or is it several projects under the Project Skyline  
**[0:17:36-0:17:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:36):**  banner? We did the feasibility study in three places. We're developing it up to realising  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:41):**  it in one place. We've got some funding in Trahearne and Rhondda, but it's a model which  
**[0:17:45-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:45):**  could be applied everywhere. And it could be applied in England. I mean, it's already  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:48):**  being delivered in Scotland, 200 communities, but giving communities some control, some  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:54):**  economic access and control, design control over some landscape and forestry is a very  
**[0:17:59-0:18:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:17:59):**  good form of land, but there are other forms that farmland could be done, other forms of  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:03):**  land. We're treading a new path outside of Scotland where they have a different land  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:07):**  history and a different governance structure to try to do this. So this is the first pilot.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:11):**  Jason Vale – You've talked about the way in which left behind communities often feel  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:15):**  that they lack influence and this control over their own lives and their surroundings.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:21):**  And you've talked about there being a sort of a learned helplessness. And I wonder what  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:26):**  you mean by that. And I wonder how Project Skyline is aiming to address that in particular.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:32):**  Simon Rimmer – Well, okay. I just want to start with a quick anecdote. So one of the  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:35):**  consultation exercises we did in the Rhondda, it was quite interesting. An older lady with  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:39):**  the blue rinse hair came up to me and she poked me in the chest. It was a big one. We  
**[0:18:43-0:18:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:43):**  had 100 people in the hall and she poked the finger in my chest and said, it's all very  
**[0:18:46-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:46):**  well Mr. Blake, but I can tell you that this project, it'll end, the funding will stop,  
**[0:18:51-0:18:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:51):**  the offices that you've appointed will disappear and we'll be left and nothing will have changed.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:56):**  You know, that is the thinking, you know, this has happened, there's millions and millions  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:18:59):**  of pounds has been spent on community development on all sorts of projects, there's been over  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:04):**  investment in, mainly through the EU, ironically in transport infrastructure, in health and  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:10):**  educational infrastructure. And it hasn't made much of a difference to life expectancy,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:15):**  to incomes, to educational levels, it hasn't altered. And so actually we've got to do something  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:20):**  different and to me, control is the difference. Actually giving a community the right to control  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:26):**  something, to break this learned helplessness where all of the decisions are made far away.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:31):**  And I think one of the things that's happened over the maybe the last 50 years is that decisions  
**[0:19:35-0:19:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:35):**  over land have moved into boardrooms and into national governments. They've gone further  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:41):**  and further away from locality. In farmland, the globalisation of the farm infrastructure,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:47):**  the capital investments in farmland means that those decisions about farm management  
**[0:19:51-0:19:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:51):**  strategies are being taken in corporate boardrooms, which might be another continent. Forestry  
**[0:19:55-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:19:55):**  driven by global market forces and a forestry manager in the case of 50 miles away from  
**[0:20:02-0:20:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:02):**  the people in the South Wales valleys are making decisions and barely consulting, I  
**[0:20:05-0:20:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:05):**  mean really barely consulting at all with the people who actually live surrounded by  
**[0:20:09-0:20:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:09):**  that forestry. It's also true of land development for housing and the recent proposed changes  
**[0:20:15-0:20:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:15):**  to the planning laws in England are again a taking away of local power into a central  
**[0:20:22-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:22):**  government and so this all just adds up. And what we're trying to do, I think we're all  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:26):**  trying to do is to relocalise control, to bring control back to people who are the most  
**[0:20:31-0:20:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:31):**  impacted and what we found through the work we did on Skyline is that actually naturally  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:36):**  people want a balance. They don't want just to make the most money, they don't want the  
**[0:20:40-0:20:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:40):**  timber just to be the most productive. Yes they want jobs, yes they want a long term  
**[0:20:45-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:45):**  future for their jobs, yes they want to engage with the landscape but they also want a better  
**[0:20:49-0:20:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:49):**  place for nature, they want better flood prevention, they want better carbon capture and these  
**[0:20:54-0:20:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:54):**  are all of the things that a local community with multiple values can give you which a  
**[0:20:59-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:20:59):**  corporation whether public or private pursuing a single value will not deliver. The evidence  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:04):**  from Scotland and also what we're finding in Wales is that you need grants and you need  
**[0:21:09-0:21:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:09):**  some big grants to get these communities set up. You know to set up a forestry enterprise  
**[0:21:14-0:21:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:14):**  needs capital equipment, it needs support, you need training, you need all sorts of things.  
**[0:21:18-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:18):**  We're looking to do some work on controlled environment agriculture. We need knowledge  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:23):**  inputs, we need investment inputs to do that. So that is needed. My long term goal would  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:29):**  be to make communities independent, take them off grant dependency because grant dependency  
**[0:21:34-0:21:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:34):**  is another form of remote control because the panel that makes the decision about the  
**[0:21:39-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:39):**  grant do not live in that community, they live somewhere else always kind of by definition.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:44):**  And so actually if you can say okay you've got a means of making an income, you've got  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:47):**  forestry, you've got food production, you've got energy generation, you're making a surplus.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:52):**  How you spend that surplus actually is entirely up to you. You don't have to do a grant application,  
**[0:21:56-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:21:56):**  you're not dependent on a panel decision, it's you and you can make judgments about  
**[0:22:01-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:01):**  the short term, the medium or the long term. And that's why economic assets and economic  
**[0:22:06-0:22:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:06):**  sustainability I think in the end are really important, but grant income is very important  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:11):**  in getting to that grant independence.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:13):**  Jason Vale-  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:13):**  James, obviously with Big Local the decision has been taken to take that panel away so  
**[0:22:19-0:22:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:19):**  that the grant applications don't have to be made in the same way, that money is just  
**[0:22:22-0:22:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:22):**  available. But in just the same way that Chris is there talking about the fact that their  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:26):**  focus is land but there is a need to create self-sustainability, I wonder whether land  
**[0:22:32-0:22:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:32):**  plays a role in the way that you're thinking about how Big Local might develop in the future.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:38):**  Chris  
**[0:22:37-0:22:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:37):**  Yeah, I mean I would say about, that's absolutely right, that Big Local perhaps is one example  
**[0:22:43-0:22:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:43):**  of a charity programme where the decisions aren't made by a board remotely, but all the  
**[0:22:49-0:22:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:49):**  decision making is in the local area. And it's critically, it's a long term programme,  
**[0:22:53-0:22:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:53):**  so it's 10 to 15 years. So there's a lot of opportunity there for mistakes to be made,  
**[0:22:59-0:23:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:22:59):**  for reversals, for conflicts to be overcome and so on, which you don't get in short term  
**[0:23:03-0:23:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:03):**  grant programmes. Quite often we find it isn't just about the money, you know the money is  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:09):**  an enabler, but money is in a way the thing in Big Local at least that brings people together  
**[0:23:14-0:23:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:14):**  and that gets people a foot in the door with other organisations and so on. It's kind of  
**[0:23:20-0:23:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:20):**  a bargaining chip, but a lot of successful Big Local partnerships haven't actually spent all  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:25):**  of their money. The money is in a way a starting point, but it's not the be all and end all by any  
**[0:23:30-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:30):**  means. You asked about assets and you know it is, we do see that across the 150 Big Local partnerships,  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:36):**  whether it's very low in social infrastructure in the community, where there aren't the places  
**[0:23:40-0:23:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:40):**  to meet, then that is almost invariably a priority for the partnership to actually get somewhere  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:47):**  where they can come together and make those decisions and also be a community. You know,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:51):**  see other people, run events and support young people, run a nitta matter, coffee morning,  
**[0:23:56-0:24:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:23:56):**  cafe, whatever. In that sense, that aspect of assets is incredibly important.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:01):**  Land comes into the question a lot when we're talking about food and so it's something like  
**[0:24:05-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:05):**  as a result of the lockdown from Covid, two thirds or more Big Local partnerships are doing emergency  
**[0:24:11-0:24:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:11):**  food provision, about half of Big Locals are doing some sort of food growing and so on. A big barrier  
**[0:24:17-0:24:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:17):**  actually to scaling that work up. We understand through working with the Food, Farm and Countryside  
**[0:24:22-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:22):**  Commission, researching what was happening across the network, that access to land is a bit of a  
**[0:24:27-0:24:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:27):**  barrier and so you know there's a desire in many communities to grow more, to connect the growing  
**[0:24:34-0:24:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:34):**  with you know engagement programs and sort of mental health programs and so on, but also food  
**[0:24:40-0:24:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:40):**  delivery and consumption and celebration of food to carry that up. But quite often just the land  
**[0:24:45-0:24:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:45):**  isn't available, the rents are too high, farmers are unwilling to allow their land to be used for  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:50):**  that because they're holding it in case it might be available for development. Or they're very  
**[0:24:55-0:25:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:24:55):**  urban areas, you know, there's patches here and there but not on the scale that you could actually  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:00):**  go beyond sort of small community garden or allotment. So we're interested in exploring that  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:06):**  and how we can connect with others, perhaps sort of borrowing from some of the approaches that  
**[0:25:11-0:25:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:11):**  Skyline has. Just going back to Wales for a moment. Wales of course famously has the  
**[0:25:16-0:25:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:16):**  Well-Being of Future Generations Act which was passed by the Welsh Parliament in 2015.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:22):**  It's regarded jealously by progressive governments around the world. I know for example New Zealand  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:27):**  is very interested in how they can follow Wales example. How has the Future Generations Act made  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:33):**  a difference to your project, to Project Skyline? Well I think it's been essential. I mean it's  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:39):**  meant that we've been listened to by public bodies, by the Welsh Government, by the local  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:43):**  authorities, by Natural Resources Wales who are the land managers, they're not the land owners,  
**[0:25:47-0:25:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:47):**  the land we're talking about is owned by the Welsh Government but managed by Natural Resources Wales  
**[0:25:52-0:25:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:52):**  which is effectively in for these purposes the Forestry Commission in Wales. And what it  
**[0:25:58-0:26:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:25:58):**  enshrines these obligations on public bodies to balance multiple goals. It isn't just about  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:04):**  maximizing income and so much of legislation is within the public sector is about maximizing  
**[0:26:09-0:26:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:09):**  benefit and not talking about long-term benefits, not talking about community, not talking about  
**[0:26:14-0:26:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:14):**  health and other other well-being benefits. And so it creates a balance seven competing goals that  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:20):**  have to be taken into consideration in decisions that public bodies take. But also just as  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:24):**  importantly has these five ways of working and we're talking about 100-year time scales. If a  
**[0:26:29-0:26:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:29):**  forestry planting to harvesting cycle is 40 to 50 years you need a 100-year time scale and that  
**[0:26:36-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:36):**  enshrining of long-term thinking, of bottom-up, of partnership working, of doing the right things at  
**[0:26:42-0:26:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:42):**  the right scale, all of those are the principles enshrined in the Act. And so to be honest I don't  
**[0:26:46-0:26:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:46):**  think without the Act I don't think we'd have got as far as we have got. We're building on those  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:50):**  principles and then applying them to local communities. And it's interesting when you  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:26:55):**  think about the well-being of future generations you're looking ahead and in the same way Project  
**[0:27:00-0:27:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:00):**  Skyline is doing that in quite a literal sort of sense isn't it? Because when you talk about  
**[0:27:05-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:05):**  a Project Skyline you're literally talking about what you can see to the Skyline.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:09):**  No that's right and the Skyline name, the right, I mean it was a bit of a cheeky name by me. I  
**[0:27:14-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:14):**  anticipated what the objections would be and they would say, well we're not sure we can trust the  
**[0:27:18-0:27:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:18):**  community and we don't think so why don't you have these three hectares over here and you look at  
**[0:27:22-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:22):**  that for five years and we'll see how you get on and then maybe we'll come back to it. And I was  
**[0:27:26-0:27:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:26):**  going no, no it's all you can see it's to the Skyline and it's for the long term and unless  
**[0:27:32-0:27:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:32):**  you deliver on that we're not going to be able to deliver the benefits that really matter.  
**[0:27:36-0:27:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:36):**  So it's a project title as an advocacy tool. Brian E, Selby has a population of around 90,000  
**[0:27:41-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:41):**  citizens who are surrounded by rather wonderful farm landscape up there in North Yorkshire and  
**[0:27:48-0:27:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:48):**  you've said that you feel that there is an invisible boundary around Selby that cuts  
**[0:27:53-0:27:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:53):**  people from, particularly from the deprived areas and backgrounds, off away from the countryside,  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:27:59):**  stops them accessing that countryside. What sort of form does that barrier take?  
**[0:28:03-0:28:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:03):**  It's interesting. I was reflecting on this question and I mean I used to work in London  
**[0:28:09-0:28:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:09):**  working with deprived communities there and I was thinking of it in that context and often,  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:14):**  you know, the countryside was geographically distant but you're right. I mean in Selby,  
**[0:28:19-0:28:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:19):**  I mean the big local area which is sort of the heart of the town centre is just 9,000 people.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:25):**  We are in a rural district, we are surrounded by lovely countryside with access to wilder countryside  
**[0:28:31-0:28:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:31):**  and yet, you know, a lot of the people that we work with and a lot of young people have very  
**[0:28:37-0:28:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:37):**  limited exposure, connection, experience of that countryside. So in terms of what that boundary is  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:45):**  and why is it there, I think some of it is still physical access which seems strange in such a  
**[0:28:51-0:28:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:51):**  small community but, you know, within our big local area, 37% of households don't have access  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:28:57):**  to a car which is significantly higher than the sort of regional average. So that really is a  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:04):**  barrier, you know, public transport is poor, it's not flexible and quite expensive. It's expensive,  
**[0:29:10-0:29:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:10):**  it really only goes to other urban areas. To get into the countryside on public transport from  
**[0:29:15-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:15):**  Selby is really challenging. You have to really want to do it. You know, the other thing is  
**[0:29:20-0:29:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:20):**  something to do with sort of cultural experience or the sort of, you know, the norms of your family  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:26):**  and your neighbourhoods and I think there isn't that collective experience of being in the  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:32):**  countryside. So I think it takes a lot to change that, you know, that kind of it's not for me  
**[0:29:38-0:29:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:38):**  response or that potential apathy to something different. You know, that's a real sort of  
**[0:29:42-0:29:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:42):**  psychological barrier. Do you think there's a degree to which people are kind of nervous,  
**[0:29:46-0:29:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:46):**  they're not sure what to do when they get to the countryside, they're not sure how they're  
**[0:29:50-0:29:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:50):**  going to be received, how people will treat them? I think there definitely is something about not  
**[0:29:54-0:29:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:54):**  knowing what it's going to be like or feeling like you need permission to be somewhere that  
**[0:29:59-0:30:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:29:59):**  you're not normally. It's interesting thinking about how you sort of tackle that invisible  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:04):**  boundary. I mean, quite a few of the projects that we've been working on through Selby Big Local  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:09):**  have some sort of connection to local space and aspirations. So, you know, we deliver a  
**[0:30:16-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:16):**  programme called Big Aspirations, working with local primary schools, all about having the  
**[0:30:20-0:30:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:20):**  opportunity to experience, this is around careers and employment, but you know, trying something  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:25):**  new or seeing what's sort of beyond local environment. We're also working on a community  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:31):**  going project, so transforming a disused piece of land into what we hope is a small but lovely  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:39):**  green oasis in an urban area. You know, it's connected to a school that doesn't have any  
**[0:30:43-0:30:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:43):**  green space, it's connected to a church, it's connected to houses. And we're also kind of,  
**[0:30:49-0:30:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:49):**  you know, beginning to use some of those projects and conversations to, you know, stimulate projects  
**[0:30:54-0:30:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:54):**  around food growing or make the connections between wellbeing and nature and working with some  
**[0:30:59-0:31:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:30:59):**  sort of more specialist organisations in our area. So I kind of hope that by focusing on local spaces  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:07):**  and enhancing local spaces and making local spaces more accessible, maybe you can inspire and create  
**[0:31:13-0:31:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:13):**  that feeling of comfort that enables people to perhaps explore further afield. Our biggest food  
**[0:31:19-0:31:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:19):**  project at the moment is a community fridge. So we launched Selby Community Fridge at the beginning  
**[0:31:25-0:31:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:25):**  of January, at the beginning of the third lockdown. And that is all about taking waste food donations,  
**[0:31:32-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:32):**  primarily from supermarkets, but other food retailers and members of the public and making  
**[0:31:38-0:31:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:38):**  that fresh food available to anyone. And I think what's really interesting about the community  
**[0:31:44-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:44):**  fridge model, and it comes back to some of the kind of discussions we had earlier about kind of  
**[0:31:48-0:31:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:48):**  connecting to climate change is that the kind of the key message is really about reducing food  
**[0:31:54-0:32:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:31:54):**  waste. It obviously does address food poverty, but it's an environmental project. And we really want  
**[0:32:00-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:00):**  to use that community fridge model to do something bigger. So we want it to be a sort of a hub for  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:08):**  social connection. We want it to be a hub of developing sort of food education and knowledge  
**[0:32:13-0:32:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:13):**  and nutrition. We've just launched our first community cookery course kind of on the back  
**[0:32:18-0:32:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:18):**  of it. And we've got plans for several more. And we see this being at the heart of a new community  
**[0:32:26-0:32:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:26):**  space that we're developing in the heart of our big local area. We have aspirations for using the  
**[0:32:31-0:32:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:31):**  fridge as a bit of a catalyst to strengthen local partnerships and to develop our understanding and  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:38):**  support communities to think about their understanding of where food comes from. Look at  
**[0:32:43-0:32:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:43):**  local access to high quality nutritional food. I mean, we're lucky in many respects. Selby is a  
**[0:32:49-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:49):**  town, you know, there's lots of places to choose from, you know, when you're doing your shop,  
**[0:32:54-0:32:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:54):**  that isn't the case for many communities and probably not the case for many big local  
**[0:32:58-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:32:58):**  communities. But I think our position in a rural district means there's lots of opportunity to  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:04):**  build better connections with local farmers and link up different bits of the food system. You  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:09):**  know, we sort of think about climate change and sustainability and community resilience. You know,  
**[0:33:14-0:33:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:14):**  these are all parts of the same. Chris, we talked a little bit there about land in towns and cities.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:21):**  We've talked about the way in which you can take control of unused spaces and try and make them  
**[0:33:27-0:33:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:27):**  into oases and then connecting those people using those spaces with other places in the countryside.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:33):**  But access to land, of course, is critical to your project. And you've talked about the Forestry  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:37):**  Commission as being one of those key landowners. And I wonder in your experience how difficult it  
**[0:33:42-0:33:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:42):**  is to unlock access to land for the sort of projects that you're talking about,  
**[0:33:48-0:33:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:48):**  to persuade landowners to delegate power and resources to communities.  
**[0:33:53-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:53):**  I will answer that. But just quickly coming back to Brian is the point that Brian was saying,  
**[0:33:58-0:34:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:33:58):**  we're working, there's a young couple who spent three years trying to rent a smaller piece of land  
**[0:34:05-0:34:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:05):**  to set up a regenerative vegetable food growing process for local food production. And they  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:10):**  couldn't do it. It took them years to do it. The farmers are very reluctant because they're  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:16):**  bizarrely doing regenerative agriculture would mean that they lost some of their grant income.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:23):**  And so some of this is structural. It's in the system of grants. I know this is all changing  
**[0:34:27-0:34:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:27):**  both in England and in Wales. But some of this, we get these perverse incentives against local  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:33):**  control. It's been, not surprisingly, it's been very difficult. And it's difficult because  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:39):**  organizations, corporations, public corporations, it is about control. And the one thing if you  
**[0:34:45-0:34:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:45):**  like, which the public bodies don't want to give up anymore, as they're losing influence,  
**[0:34:51-0:34:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:51):**  they're losing cash to make change themselves. But the one thing they still have got is control.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:34:56):**  And to take away that control is a very, very difficult thing. So it's not been easy. I would  
**[0:35:01-0:35:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:01):**  say it's been very hard. It's taken us, I've been four years at this and we're making progress.  
**[0:35:07-0:35:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:07):**  In the end, it's about building trust. And I think the one thing that we've had to do,  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:11):**  and it takes time, building trust takes time. If you're going to get a public corporation,  
**[0:35:16-0:35:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:16):**  or a private individual corporation, but let's say public corporation, to give up some control,  
**[0:35:21-0:35:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:21):**  they have to trust the people that you're going to give control to. And trust isn't something that  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:26):**  you can just turn on. It has to be earned, it has to be established. And that partnership is  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:33):**  probably the most important thing that we've been working on in the last few years. Working  
**[0:35:37-0:35:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:37):**  in partnership, not taking an adversarial position, allowing trust to be built up over time,  
**[0:35:42-0:35:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:42):**  so that eventually some control and some decision making control can be transferred to the  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:48):**  satisfaction of both parties. And of course, that trust is both ways. You mentioned your old lady  
**[0:35:53-0:35:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:53):**  with the blue rinse earlier on. She has to trust, your community has to trust that having been given  
**[0:35:59-0:36:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:35:59):**  this opportunity and having invested their own time in this opportunity, that it's all not just  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:03):**  going to fade away, become another grand idea that didn't work. So I want to just go into that  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:09):**  in slightly more detail, Chris. How have you managed to convince the community, but also  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:15):**  convince the Forestry Commission to support your project?  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:18):**  Chris Binns Persuading the community was an interesting one, because this is an idea that didn't start within the community.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:23):**  This is, I was the agent, I was the seed. So I took an idea that's been flourishing in Scotland,  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:29):**  and I brought it into some of the valleys in Wales.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:33):**  Toby  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:33):**  Did Scotland's success kind of help to de-risk that for the community that you're working with in Wales?  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:38):**  Chris Binns Absolutely. And the one, the biggest single thing that we, the most beneficial thing that we did is we took 15  
**[0:36:44-0:36:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:44):**  people from three different communities in the South Wales valleys, and we took them to visit  
**[0:36:49-0:36:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:49):**  self-managing land-only communities in Scotland. And that was the turning point. Before it was,  
**[0:36:55-0:36:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:55):**  well, it all sounds very big idea, Chris, but it's not really for us, is it? And to some extent,  
**[0:36:59-0:37:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:36:59):**  they didn't trust themselves. The community didn't trust that we could deliver it, that they could  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:03):**  deliver it, that they could manage it, they could govern it in the right way. We went to Scotland,  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:08):**  we spent three, four days with communities. And the comment was, but they're just like us, you know,  
**[0:37:14-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:14):**  they're no different. And they did this. And they've set up a forestry enterprise, and they're  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:18):**  selling firewood, and they're building social housing out of timber that they've harvested,  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:23):**  and they've got growing projects, and they've got a hydro scheme. And if they can do it, or we can do  
**[0:37:28-0:37:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:28):**  it. And that was the, that was absolutely the turning point. It was the communities talking to  
**[0:37:32-0:37:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:32):**  each other. It wasn't me. I just, I just said, hey, what about this? And why don't we go out and meet  
**[0:37:37-0:37:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:37):**  them? And that was the catalyst. Then that, so that was about the community thinking, hey, yeah,  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:42):**  we can do this with there's no reason. We've then got to, we've then got to convince the public  
**[0:37:47-0:37:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:47):**  authorities that this isn't lunacy, that this isn't going to result in unnecessary risk. And,  
**[0:37:55-0:38:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:37:55):**  you know, civil servants for very good reason are very averse to risk. They, they, I've had it  
**[0:38:00-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:00):**  quoted to me several times, what they call the daily mail test, you know, you say this, but what  
**[0:38:04-0:38:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:04):**  happens if it goes wrong on the date and we're on the front page of the daily mail? What then?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:09):**  And one, and we, and this has come up very recently, it was being fed back to me that  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:12):**  they were very scared because what if, you know, if this is a community forestry project,  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:17):**  and somebody has kills, you know, dog walker is killed by a tree, then oh, it's cool. It's,  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:22):**  it's going to look bad on us, us, the civil servants for having let you have control.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:25):**  And, and then you have to point out, well, no, no, we're not going to be, it's not going to be a  
**[0:38:29-0:38:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:29):**  bunch of OAPs running around on a Sunday morning with chainsaws. This is going to be a properly  
**[0:38:35-0:38:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:35):**  managed health and safety approved forestry standards approved operation, which is just  
**[0:38:41-0:38:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:41):**  under community control. It's not about letting a bunch of DIY as loose with, with, with chainsaws.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:48):**  Although now that you mentioned that, that does sound like a fantastic movie franchise.  
**[0:38:54-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:54):**  The, the thing I was wondering as well, I mean, I was looking at one of the articles that you've  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:38:58):**  written online and there was, there was a comment underneath it, which I thought was just priceless.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:02):**  It was, it was somebody saying, well, this, this project Skyline is all very well, but what we need  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:07):**  here is jobs. And it kind of missed the point that what you're doing is, is empowering that community  
**[0:39:12-0:39:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:12):**  and giving that community the power to say, well, yeah, our priority is jobs. So let's create some.  
**[0:39:16-0:39:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:16):**  And well, and what I've been very careful to do is to say, it's not for me to say that Skyline is  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:22):**  about jobs. It's not for me to say that it's about nature. What it is is it's giving and empowering a  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:28):**  community to make decisions that they want to make that based on their situation and their  
**[0:39:32-0:39:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:32):**  circumstances and their priorities. So actually I'm trying to give a capacity to make decisions,  
**[0:39:38-0:39:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:38):**  but what that decision is, it could be about jobs. It could be about flood prevention. It could be  
**[0:39:43-0:39:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:43):**  about nature. It could be about, it's not for me to decide. It's for you to decide. And it's for you  
**[0:39:49-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:49):**  to decide not just now, but in the future as well in 50 years time, and your children might make  
**[0:39:53-0:39:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:53):**  different decisions about that landscape management than you might. And that's fine. And to me,  
**[0:39:58-0:40:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:39:58):**  that's the most important principle. And that's, that's where the power of it lies.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:02):**  James, Big Local is based on that idea, that idea that communities know best, that communities in  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:09):**  and of themselves are powerful. Now food, we've discussed this off and on throughout the programme.  
**[0:40:15-0:40:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:15):**  It's at the heart of any community. People come together to eat meals, to spend time with each  
**[0:40:20-0:40:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:20):**  other as families, as friends in pubs, restaurants, church and community halls. So how can we make  
**[0:40:27-0:40:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:27):**  that connection even stronger, even more creative and more vibrant as we work together in communities  
**[0:40:34-0:40:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:34):**  to achieve net zero? I mean, food is something which definitely brings communities together.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:38):**  And I think the work we've done with Food, Farming and Countryside Commission shows that working with  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:43):**  food as a way of building community is a lens through which to see, strengthening communities,  
**[0:40:48-0:40:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:48):**  you know, aligns beautifully. But in a way, it isn't about food in the same way that it's not  
**[0:40:52-0:40:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:52):**  about jobs. It's not about the economy. What we need, I really hear what Chris is saying about  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:40:57):**  the need for trust. And there's a mindset shift that needs to take place right across the economy  
**[0:41:03-0:41:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:03):**  and society, you know, in central government, in local government, in business and so on,  
**[0:41:07-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:07):**  that it's okay to trust people to take decisions that will shape their own lives. But that also  
**[0:41:12-0:41:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:12):**  means changing your own behaviour and relinquishing some power. So there's a mindset shift, we then  
**[0:41:18-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:18):**  need to create the conditions for communities to thrive. We need to invest in the foundations  
**[0:41:23-0:41:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:23):**  for successful community, communities that can function where people feel able to participate,  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:28):**  come together, make decisions, get on with each other, you know, organise and do stuff, and, you  
**[0:41:33-0:41:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:33):**  know, create enterprise and create jobs and create brilliant food projects. And then, you know,  
**[0:41:38-0:41:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:38):**  away you go. Amazing things can be achieved, as Chris and Brian have been describing.  
**[0:41:42-0:41:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Food-builds-community-e13un20#t=0:41:42):**  Fantastic. What a great way to end. That's all we have time for. I'd like to thank my guests,

**[0:00:00-0:00:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:00):**  Welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne. Dominic Cummings, the UK Prime Minister's  
**[0:00:11-0:00:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:11):**  Strategist in Chief, has said that he wants to shake up government. He wants to break  
**[0:00:15-0:00:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:15):**  the alleged stranglehold that the civil service has over policy development and delivery.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:20):**  He's asked for ideas and we want to help. Of course, our focus is agricultural land  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:26):**  use and food production, and my goodness, what challenges we face. Humanity is looking  
**[0:00:31-0:00:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:31):**  into the jaws of a climate catastrophe, at the same time as peering down the throat of  
**[0:00:36-0:00:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:36):**  a potential breakdown of nature, both of which will severely affect our ability to produce  
**[0:00:41-0:00:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:41):**  good quality, nutritionally diverse food at a national scale. Alongside these existential  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:47):**  threats we have Brexit, new trade deals and rapidly evolving supply chains. Is Britain  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:53):**  up to the job? As we leave the Common Agricultural Policy, can Dominic Cummings help ministers  
**[0:00:58-0:01:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:00:58):**  to unleash the vibrancy of the market and the ingenuity of our farmers and communities?  
**[0:01:05-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:05):**  Or will the civil service clamp him down with paper clips, wrap paperwork and process around  
**[0:01:11-0:01:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:11):**  his ambition, finally smothering the bouncing baby of a burgeoning bottom-up land use revolution?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:17):**  Well, I've spoken to five big beasts of the food and farming community. I've asked  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:23):**  them to help me to help Dom. Each of them has two minutes to outline their reforms,  
**[0:01:29-0:01:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:29):**  followed by a short conversation about their ideas, six minutes each in total. In other  
**[0:01:34-0:01:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:34):**  words, it's the perfect length of podcast for Dominic Cummings to listen to on his commute.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:40):**  Let's hope he does.  
**[0:01:42-0:01:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:42):**  First up, we have Sue Pritchard. Sue is the director of the highly influential RSA food  
**[0:01:47-0:01:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:47):**  farming and countryside commission. I gave her two minutes to reform the government.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:01:53):**  So I'm going straight at the seat of power. I'm going for Treasury reform. And I would  
**[0:02:01-0:02:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:01):**  like to see at the heart of Treasury, in fact, senior to the chief secretary to the Treasury,  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:06):**  a new secretary to the Treasury for public value. So so often, departments are played  
**[0:02:13-0:02:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:13):**  off against each other. So these really important issues that you outline things like climate  
**[0:02:17-0:02:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:17):**  change and the nature crisis, but also the public health crisis and the crisis of the  
**[0:02:22-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:22):**  polarization in our communities stay as crises because the opportunities for acting on them  
**[0:02:29-0:02:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:29):**  sit across multiple departments. And so the interests of departments act against the requirement  
**[0:02:36-0:02:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:36):**  to work more collaboratively together. And we need to break that down. So a secretary  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:42):**  for public value will utilize a thing that already exists within Treasury, but is very  
**[0:02:47-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:47):**  underutilized. That's called the public value framework. It will have responsibility to  
**[0:02:52-0:03:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:02:52):**  do four things. First of all, develop an expanded scope for that public value framework and  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:00):**  look at the whole resource that contributes or depletes public value. At the moment, it  
**[0:03:05-0:03:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:05):**  just looks at public spending. But there are so many other ways that support public value  
**[0:03:11-0:03:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:11):**  or deplete it through private sector resources. Then we would look at the value in supply  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:15):**  chains, we'd look at value in place, we would look at the kind of value that's generated  
**[0:03:21-0:03:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:21):**  through healthy social processes. And finally, we'd be looking at all of the ways in which  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:26):**  other sectors, other industries, other businesses actually extract public value for their own  
**[0:03:33-0:03:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:33):**  profit, leaving the bill at the Treasury door, all of that needs to be made more visible  
**[0:03:38-0:03:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:38):**  to be confronted and to be acted on at the heart of the power base, which is in Treasury  
**[0:03:42-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:42):**  itself.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:43):**  Thank you very much for that. That's a really interesting set of proposals. I'm interested  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:47):**  in that last element first, how businesses extract public value.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:52):**  So there are so many ways in which businesses and whole sectors are currently benefiting  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:03:59):**  from their activities through passing off costs elsewhere to the public purse.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:05):**  And who do you have in mind here? Just give us an example.  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:09):**  Let's talk about agrochemical companies who make an absolute fortune out of supplying  
**[0:04:15-0:04:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:15):**  synthetic chemicals to the farming sector, and which then require cleaning up out of  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:22):**  the water system. And let's talk about sugar. Sugar companies currently make significant  
**[0:04:29-0:04:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:29):**  profit through growing a crop that has a marginal benefit for the human diet. We can tax unhealthy  
**[0:04:38-0:04:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:38):**  products and we can tax activities that are passed off. But I think more importantly,  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:44):**  we can raise the regulatory baseline.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:47):**  So let's go back to the bigger picture, a Secretary of State for Public Value. To look  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:52):**  at this issue that you're saying is diluted across a number of different departments and  
**[0:04:56-0:05:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:04:56):**  find a way of pulling that together and giving the issue some clout.  
**[0:05:00-0:05:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:00):**  Do you know, I'd go even further. I would say that that minister could also be responsible  
**[0:05:06-0:05:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:06):**  for two other things. We need a new economic paradigm. At the moment, the way that we measure  
**[0:05:11-0:05:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:11):**  economic performance through GDP is proving to be destructive and unhelpful. And in countries  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:17):**  who've started thinking about a well-being economy, they're exploring those ways in which  
**[0:05:22-0:05:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:22):**  we can put public value at the heart of the heart of an economic system. The second thing  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:27):**  that needs to happen, I think, is the broader definition of public value and exploring more  
**[0:05:31-0:05:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:31):**  what public really values. We need much better systems to understand what really matter to  
**[0:05:39-0:05:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:39):**  the public. Our current democratic processes are deeply inadequate and so easily manipulated  
**[0:05:45-0:05:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:45):**  by people with particular interests and those that lobby for them.  
**[0:05:49-0:05:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:49):**  I'm reminded as you talk about a well-being economy about the proposals from Dieter Helm  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:05:55):**  around natural capital. And of course, those who have come in for criticism, some people  
**[0:06:00-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:00):**  find it somehow difficult to put a financial value, which is what he's proposed, to some  
**[0:06:08-0:06:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:08):**  of these sort of more well-being related elements about enjoyment of the countryside and so  
**[0:06:13-0:06:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:13):**  on. Is that a similar issue here? Are we talking about in a well-being economy trying to put  
**[0:06:18-0:06:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:18):**  a financial value against people's sense of well-being and how they experience it?  
**[0:06:24-0:06:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:24):**  Well, I think you're absolutely right to point up the limitations of the capital's approach,  
**[0:06:30-0:06:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:30):**  because that comes at the conversation through a particular economic paradigm and financialising  
**[0:06:37-0:06:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:37):**  all the things that are really important to us. I think we need to change the conversation  
**[0:06:40-0:06:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:40):**  away from extractive notions and towards more regenerative principles. Kate Rayworth expresses  
**[0:06:48-0:06:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:48):**  this brilliantly in donut economics and requires us to think much more creatively and frankly  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:06:56):**  honestly about those things that we really value. We need to shift that conversation  
**[0:07:00-0:07:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:00):**  and that has to happen at the heart of Treasury.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:04):**  So the government at the moment in Defra is reforming through its agriculture bill the  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:09):**  way that farmers receive funding so that we have a new model of public funds for public  
**[0:07:14-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:14):**  goods. But what it seems to me is that your proposal around public value is a way of trying  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:21):**  to reconnect that work at a farm level with the customer, with the citizen, so that there  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:28):**  is a much better sort of broader understanding of the value of the countryside, the value  
**[0:07:33-0:07:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:33):**  of nature and good and high quality nutritious food production.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:38):**  That's exactly right. And how all of the different systems interconnect. So while we're talking  
**[0:07:43-0:07:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:43):**  about the agriculture bill and farm payments, they also intimately connected with state  
**[0:07:50-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:50):**  of biodiversity, with the economic prospects of rural communities and the nation's health  
**[0:07:57-0:08:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:07:57):**  and wellbeing. That needs to be understood in the round.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:01):**  That was Sue Pritchardt from the RSA. Guy Smith is the deputy president of the National  
**[0:08:07-0:08:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:07):**  Farmers Union. I gave him a magic wand and asked him to spell out the changes that he  
**[0:08:13-0:08:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:13):**  would like to see. Well, obviously, Brexit is going to impact  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:17):**  on agriculture probably more than any other industry. So for a generation, since the 1960s,  
**[0:08:23-0:08:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:23):**  more or less, agricultural policy and delivery has largely been in the command of Brussels.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:30):**  But now it's going to be repatriated back to Whitehall. And so for the first time for  
**[0:08:36-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:36):**  a generation, the civil servants of Whitehall are going to be fully in charge of agricultural  
**[0:08:42-0:08:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:42):**  policy. And there are a number of departments that will have a big impact on the future  
**[0:08:49-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:49):**  of agriculture as we lay out the path to the next generation. The Home Office will be in  
**[0:08:55-0:09:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:08:55):**  charge of access to labour. DAFRA will clearly be a key department for laying out agricultural  
**[0:09:02-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:02):**  policy. But let's not forget the likes of DCMS when it comes to broadband provision,  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:08):**  MHCLG, another department that are going to be in charge of rural infrastructure, and  
**[0:09:14-0:09:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:14):**  the Department of Trade, obviously key trade deals determining the future of British agriculture  
**[0:09:20-0:09:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:20):**  in that respect. So a lot of new agendas across Whitehall. Now, how the best way to rearrange  
**[0:09:30-0:09:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:30):**  those various departments to address this plethora of issues is a very good one on the  
**[0:09:37-0:09:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:37):**  one hand, you could say, well, let's be cautious and stick to the web we know, as it were,  
**[0:09:46-0:09:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:46):**  and not try and shake the cocktail up too much. On the other hand, you could say, no,  
**[0:09:53-0:10:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:09:53):**  this is a time for brave, radical thinking. We need new approaches, new responsibilities  
**[0:10:00-0:10:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:00):**  in different departments. Climate change, you know, probably the biggest challenge humanity  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:06):**  has in front of it, and how we feed the population of the globe that is rising exponentially  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:12):**  without further pressurising our planet, huge challenges. And we will watch this space at  
**[0:10:19-0:10:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:19):**  the moment, the NFU lobbies across government across departments, but we will be light footed  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:26):**  if we see the map changing radically.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:29):**  It's interesting, isn't it? Because of course, those of us who've been working on this over  
**[0:10:32-0:10:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:32):**  the last three years or so, you know, we've just kind of got on with the job, we've been  
**[0:10:37-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:37):**  thinking about the policies and the way that things need to change. But you're absolutely  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:41):**  right. This is the first time that DEFRA will have had proper control over agricultural  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:47):**  policy, land policy, the way that the infrastructure works to deliver that policy for a very long  
**[0:10:53-0:10:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:53):**  time. And the question of whether DEFRA itself can do that job remains to be seen. So do  
**[0:10:59-0:11:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:10:59):**  you think there is a need for, I don't know, a cabinet level committee or perhaps a new  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:04):**  department that factors in food, you know, at front and centre of what it does to cut  
**[0:11:11-0:11:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:11):**  across these different departments that you mentioned?  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:13):**  Well, I'm sure if you spoke to most farmers, they would say we want math back, the Ministry  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:19):**  of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, because they feel that that gives our industry the  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:26):**  prestige and prominence that we think it needs. Unfortunately, I think that's unlikely to  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:32):**  happen, although, you know, we would always put that out there as a demand. So I think  
**[0:11:38-0:11:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:38):**  we will in future continue to have to walk through the front doors of several departments  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:42):**  on different issues. But the more centralised they are, then it's probably going to be more  
**[0:11:48-0:11:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:48):**  coherent. So if there was a department for climate change, then obviously, food production  
**[0:11:56-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:11:56):**  and the management of the land of the UK would fit fully in that department. But it is just  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:02):**  too early to tell. And I suppose too often you don't find out whether these new ideas  
**[0:12:08-0:12:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:08):**  have worked until after the event, which sometimes is too late, or sometimes you applaud the  
**[0:12:14-0:12:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:14):**  blue sky thinking that took place in the initiation.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:17):**  I wonder if you have a view about the amount of power and control that governments should  
**[0:12:23-0:12:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:23):**  have. Obviously, a farmer knows their own land, and they can potentially work with quite  
**[0:12:30-0:12:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:30):**  broad goals that governments set in order to deliver the best possible achievements,  
**[0:12:36-0:12:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:36):**  the best possible outcomes against those goals at a local level. How much, at the same time,  
**[0:12:42-0:12:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:42):**  you know, in the same way that Brussels has over the course of the last few decades, there  
**[0:12:46-0:12:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:46):**  can be quite specific measures, directions over inputs and outcomes. Where do you think  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:52):**  that balance lies?  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:53):**  Well, again, going back to the farm gate, you know, most farmers would much rather get  
**[0:12:59-0:13:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:12:59):**  on with the job of managing the countryside and producing food and to be paid by the market  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:07):**  and to have as little government or regulatory interference as possible. However, again,  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:13):**  I think this is a most unlikely scenario. By the very nature of agriculture, you get  
**[0:13:20-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:20):**  involved in the management of the environment, whether it's water, air or soil, and regulation  
**[0:13:27-0:13:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:27):**  comes fast and furious. It always has done. And across the world, governments tend to  
**[0:13:32-0:13:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:32):**  view food as a strategic thing. And that's been the case in history as well. Politicians  
**[0:13:39-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:39):**  always get a bit wary of the possibility of having a hungry population because they are,  
**[0:13:45-0:13:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:45):**  that is a very angry electorate. And so if politicians ever think there may be an interruption  
**[0:13:50-0:13:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:50):**  in food supplies, they move pretty, pretty quickly. And it's interesting that under  
**[0:13:56-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:13:56):**  new agricultural bill, there is now a greed and the NFE were very keen on this, that there  
**[0:14:01-0:14:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:01):**  will be a review of food security. So to make sure that as a nation, we retain the ability  
**[0:14:07-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:07):**  to feed ourselves. Guy Smith there from the NFU. Vicky Heard is the sustainable farming  
**[0:14:14-0:14:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:14):**  coordinator at Sustain, a coalition organisation representing over 100 food and farming NGOs.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:21):**  I would look at restructuring government. So you have a climate and nature emergency  
**[0:14:27-0:14:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:27):**  department, not just climate because I think you can get some really bad outcomes if you  
**[0:14:32-0:14:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:32):**  follow purely a climate focus. So I think it'd be good to have a department at cabinet  
**[0:14:37-0:14:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:37):**  level. So it was covering all departments and really driving change across the board  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:43):**  to deliver a sustainable food and farming programme, building on the public money for  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:48):**  public goods programme that we've already got. So paying farmers to get it right and  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:53):**  helping land managers to do the right thing to build up nature based solutions. And that  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:14:59):**  solutions in the field as well as around the field. I think we've got to really not separate  
**[0:15:04-0:15:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:04):**  the two. I think there's a real risk in doing a land sparing approach rather than sharing.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:09):**  It's really got to be phasing out things like factory farms, which draw in far too much  
**[0:15:14-0:15:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:14):**  inputs into the system and chemicals, the chemical treadmill that the farmers are on.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:18):**  And to do that, I think we ought to implement an agro ecological education scheme, 10 years  
**[0:15:24-0:15:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:24):**  for agroecology where farmers are given training, but training that really suits them, that  
**[0:15:29-0:15:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:29):**  takes them from where they are in the agroecological spectrum to the next stage and onwards and  
**[0:15:35-0:15:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:35):**  make it really accessible, affordable or free to farmers to actually get that appropriate  
**[0:15:41-0:15:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:41):**  training and appropriate technologies. There are some great technologies coming online.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:46):**  Let's use them. Let's not go down the route of all technologies are going to be great  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:50):**  because they're going to give us instant food without all the environmental consequences.  
**[0:15:55-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:15:55):**  That's not the way to go. I think we need to be still farming proper food from the soil,  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:00):**  but using the best technologies, but also using knowledge and agro nature based systems.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:06):**  And for all that to work, we've got to make the market work. We need to really develop  
**[0:16:11-0:16:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:11):**  new routes to market for farmers so they can go out with the current incredibly, incredibly  
**[0:16:18-0:16:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:18):**  concentrated market that they have to deal with now. So they need to be able to get out  
**[0:16:22-0:16:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:22):**  of those big retailer markets and go collaborate and cooperate themselves.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:28):**  Vicky, we're out of time. That's two minutes. That's fantastic. But there's so much, so  
**[0:16:34-0:16:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:34):**  much in there, so much in there. What I'm interested in this climate and nature emergency  
**[0:16:39-0:16:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:39):**  department, what is it responsible for that's different to what Defra is responsible for  
**[0:16:44-0:16:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:44):**  now? What's thrown in, what's thrown out? Yeah, well, obviously climate covers far more  
**[0:16:50-0:16:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:50):**  than farming. So it's got to cover all the energy, transport, housing, getting all that  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:16:55):**  right, but also seeing farming and land use as part of that. So it would have the whole  
**[0:17:00-0:17:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:00):**  gamut of solutions available and be able to drive change, you know, but also not to drive  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:07):**  it in a way that will destroy the nature that we need also to rely on. So it would be taking  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:13):**  some from Defra and from other departments, certainly Bayes, to deliver what we need.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:19):**  So it's a new department while we still keep hold of the other departments. Defra still  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:24):**  exists, but we have this department as well. Yeah, and it needs to include international.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:28):**  Our international footprint is huge, not just in food, but it is food and feed. So we need  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:33):**  to be thinking about challenging those that impact overseas. There's good trade and there's  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:39):**  bad trade and we need that department would have to take account of that as well. What  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:42):**  I'm interested in is whether this is a continued sort of big government approach where this  
**[0:17:48-0:17:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:48):**  new department will come up with bright ideas and then prescribe what needs to happen on  
**[0:17:52-0:17:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:52):**  the ground. Or are you seeing this department as something which guides and sets goals,  
**[0:17:58-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:17:58):**  but gives freedom to farmers and landowners to deliver what they need to do themselves  
**[0:18:05-0:18:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:05):**  and to come up with their own solutions? That's a really good question. I don't think I have  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:08):**  the answer to that because I've seen voluntary approaches fail on so many occasions. Leaving  
**[0:18:14-0:18:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:14):**  it to the market has not worked over the last 30, 40 years. So I think what you describe  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:20):**  where it could actually guide and give the right incentives, rewards and regulation and  
**[0:18:25-0:18:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:25):**  that kind of approach could work, but it still needs that level of intervention. Maybe in  
**[0:18:31-0:18:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:31):**  10 years time it would be needed if the industry is going the right direction, but I'm a bit  
**[0:18:35-0:18:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:35):**  nervous about leaving it all to the market. No, absolutely. And I mean what I was meaning  
**[0:18:39-0:18:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:39):**  more was that there is a legislative framework which is more broad brush, which requires  
**[0:18:45-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:45):**  the farmers deliver against certain goals in order to be continuing in receipt of public  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:51):**  money. And of course, you know, then there's sort of regulations, legal compliance sort  
**[0:18:54-0:19:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:18:54):**  of associated with that as well. But at the moment, defra seems to be quite prescriptive  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:00):**  in terms of inputs, for example, for sustainable improvements on farms. And that there's an  
**[0:19:06-0:19:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:06):**  argument that that perhaps limits the need for farmers to actually have a broad understanding  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:12):**  of why and what they're doing. Yeah, I think that's where my agroecological schools could  
**[0:19:17-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:17):**  come in. You might not like the term, it might not ever run like that. But it's having a  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:23):**  system whereby farmers can actually get access to the tools that they might need and the  
**[0:19:27-0:19:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:27):**  range of tools that they might want to apply, but not being prescriptive, as you say, but  
**[0:19:31-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:31):**  I think in some in some areas, they need to be prescriptive, such as our huge use of very  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:37):**  unsustainable feeds or the level of chemicals if we if we can really cut back on that and  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:42):**  use integrated, genuine integrated pest management approaches. So it's, you know, setting targets,  
**[0:19:47-0:19:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:47):**  as you say, giving farmers the freedom to apply what they know, but also giving them  
**[0:19:51-0:19:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:51):**  the training advice and demonstration to help them to do that. And it sounds like from what  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:19:56):**  you've said, with your magic wand, if you were looking forward 10 years to the type  
**[0:20:00-0:20:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:00):**  of farming that we have, an agroforestry approach would be central to your vision.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:07):**  Absolutely. Agroforestry, I think has a huge part to play agroforestry and hedges to deliver  
**[0:20:14-0:20:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:14):**  both, you know, soil livestock care, soil management, as well as potentially food, you  
**[0:20:20-0:20:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:20):**  know, there's some good agroforestry schemes, which are delivering fruit and veg fruit for  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:25):**  farmers, which is an additional income. Yeah, it's a good part of the system.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:29):**  Vicky Heard from Sustain. Next up, we have Mark Bridgman. Mark is the president of the  
**[0:20:35-0:20:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:35):**  Country Land and Business Association, or the CLA, if you prefer. I asked him what he'd  
**[0:20:41-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:41):**  do if he had the power to restructure the UK government.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:46):**  I'd like to focus on four things that I think would really make a difference. Firstly, around  
**[0:20:51-0:20:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:51):**  climate change, clearly at the heart of what government's focusing on at the moment, particularly  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:20:56):**  in the lead up to the COP26 this year. We've got some big picture ideas, but what does  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:00):**  that mean on how we actually deliver it? I think we need to put in place a carbon trading  
**[0:21:04-0:21:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:04):**  system. It's the only way that we're really going to restructure the economy so that those  
**[0:21:09-0:21:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:09):**  that are generating CO2 can offset it by paying for others to sequester it. I think that carbon  
**[0:21:16-0:21:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:16):**  trading system needs to be mandatory, and that's the only way we're really going to  
**[0:21:19-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:19):**  tackle the CO2 issue. Secondly, I think in order to address the  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:23):**  productivity challenge in rural areas, which we see is very evident, we see a 16% gap between  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:29):**  rural productivity and the national average. If you close that gap, that would be 43 billion  
**[0:21:34-0:21:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:34):**  of GBA for the UK economy. In order to do that, I think the government needs to set  
**[0:21:38-0:21:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:38):**  up a cabinet committee for rural productivity to really pull the different strands together.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:44):**  Defra look at rural affairs as part of their brief, but I think it's probably underpowered  
**[0:21:48-0:21:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:48):**  and under-resourced, and it really needs to look across department. We'd like to see a  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:53):**  cabinet committee pull all that together and address rural productivity, whether it's around  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:21:58):**  planning, connectivity, and all the different challenges that are there.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:01):**  Thirdly, we think government needs to tackle the regulatory culture that we face as farmers.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:09):**  We need to move away from this incredibly bureaucratic big brother watching us filling  
**[0:22:14-0:22:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:14):**  in all these forms to the nth degree. As farmers, we have to fill in paperwork to identify down  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:20):**  to the fourth decimal place of a hectare. That's 0.0001 of a hectare. That's one square  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:27):**  meter. I worked out in the back of an envelope, that's probably 200 billion of those in the  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:31):**  UK, and we really need to move away from that micromanagement.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:35):**  Fourthly and finally, as we look to increase our trade globally as we come out of Europe,  
**[0:22:42-0:22:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:42):**  hopefully we'll continue to have a free trade with Europe, but we're going to look to trade  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:47):**  more internationally. We've got fantastic food products and produce that we can sell,  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:52):**  but we really need government to get behind that. Government has done a certain amount,  
**[0:22:55-0:23:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:22:55):**  but we think there should be a real big push and investment to support our exports, these  
**[0:23:00-0:23:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:00):**  high-end, high-product, high-quality products that we're producing in this country.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:04):**  Thank you very much. Really interesting proposals. I'd like to go into that first one. The Committee  
**[0:23:10-0:23:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:10):**  on Climate Change, when it presented its recent land use report, has proposed charging oil  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:15):**  companies and other big polluters and hypothecating that money to pay for land-based sequestration.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:21):**  I presume that that is something that you would support, but I wonder how we can achieve  
**[0:23:26-0:23:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:26):**  that land-based sequestration without land prices just going through the roof.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:31):**  Well, I think it, we certainly think it's a good idea, but I mean, we shouldn't just  
**[0:23:36-0:23:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:36):**  focus on the airline industry, for example. We need to think about the whole economy.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:40):**  What I think it will do is it will provide the funding through the private sector for  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:46):**  this really ambitious tree planting targets that the government has set and that the Climate  
**[0:23:52-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:23:52):**  Change Committee has set. I think food production and locking up carbon don't have to be mutually  
**[0:24:00-0:24:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:00):**  exclusive. They do, you know, the way that carbon is locked up in grasslands and, you  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:06):**  know, there's plenty of land out there where I think we could do this offsetting.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:12):**  So really there's a way we kind of need to look at finding ways of having that sequestration  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:18):**  value delivered alongside continued food production. Most definitely. Yeah, this is not about either  
**[0:24:24-0:24:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:24):**  or. The two things need to work together. Now, you talked about rural productivity.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:29):**  There is a real need for government to take a serious look at the way the rural economy  
**[0:24:36-0:24:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:36):**  works. You're talking about a cabinet level structure with a minister taking responsibility,  
**[0:24:43-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:43):**  not just at Defra, but across government for radical rural reform. What would be their  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:49):**  key goals? Well, for us, it's about working across department.  
**[0:24:53-0:24:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:53):**  That's, I think, really the point I want to, would make, you know, where we see the opportunity  
**[0:24:58-0:25:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:24:58):**  to boost productivity in rural areas. You know, I'll just give you some key points.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:25:03):**  One is around connectivity. Now, I know the government has spoken about this quite a bit,  
**[0:25:07-0:25:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:25:07):**  and it was talked about in the election with a sort of arms race as to who could roll out  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:25:12):**  broadband quickest. But it is hugely important getting that fiber broadband into all houses,  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:25:19):**  getting the mobile coverage. We've only got two thirds of the country has got 4G mobile  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:25:23):**  coverage from all the four networks. Yes, there's plans in place, but we need to hold  
**[0:25:27-0:25:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:25:27):**  the people that are delivering this to account. And so on connectivity, but also actually

**[0:28:40-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:28:40):**  change from from what you call social security payments for farmers. So a shift away from

**[0:29:03-0:29:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:29:03):**  We need to look at the impact of the adoption, the universal UK adoption of sustainable farming  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:29:11):**  practices on food outputs. They will dramatically affect the balance of the food commodities  
**[0:29:17-0:29:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:29:17):**  that we produce. The impact of these production changes needs to be taken into account by  
**[0:29:23-0:29:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:29:23):**  government. But it also means that we will need to change people's diets. And that can  
**[0:29:29-0:29:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:29:29):**  be achieved if the public understand the need for changed diets to align them, their future

**[0:31:03-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:31:03):**  Yes, it will be possible to deliver the change that's needed, but it is a transition which

**[0:32:34-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:32:34):**  I expected to encounter a range of views, not least about the role of government itself,  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:32:40):**  its size, its accountability and its power. But interestingly, nobody has suggested shrinking  
**[0:32:46-0:32:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:32:46):**  government. Each of the proposals, whether for new ministers or a realignment of priorities,  
**[0:32:51-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:32:51):**  has envisaged a strong role for government. Let me end by challenging that just a little.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:32:57):**  In my view, agricultural land use and food production has been under the control of government  
**[0:33:02-0:33:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:02):**  and the big retailers supported by the government for too long. We know that we are facing environmental  
**[0:33:08-0:33:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:08):**  crises, that our rural communities are struggling, that food prices bear little resemblance to  
**[0:33:13-0:33:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:13):**  the actual costs of production, let alone the externalised environmental and social  
**[0:33:18-0:33:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:18):**  costs, and that good farm animal health and welfare can be extremely patchy.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:23):**  I put it to you that government has failed, and perhaps it's time that government got  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:29):**  out of the way. Rather than creating new systems riddled with complexity, government should  
**[0:33:34-0:33:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:34):**  focus on the bigger picture. Ministers should set bold sustainable land use and food production  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:40):**  priorities focused on climate mitigation, nature's restoration and the production  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:45):**  of high quality food. But what then? Citizens and the market should pay for the food, while  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:50):**  public funds are used to pay for public goods based on the model the government has proposed.  
**[0:33:56-0:34:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:33:56):**  But using acreage as the basis for payments because every acre must either be restored  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:34:00):**  to excellence or maintained at that level.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:34:04):**  Beyond that, in my view, government needs to take a step back. Farmers need to find  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lets-help-Dominic-Cummings--Radical-proposals-for-agricultural-reform-easbfc#t=0:34:09):**  their own way to step up and take ownership of their own sustainable farm management plans.

### Farm Gate  (Fri, 08 Jul 2022 09:58:36)
**[0:00:00-0:00:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:08):**  This programme is a little different. It's the recording of a webinar run by the Food  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:12):**  and Global Security Network called Lessons from Ukraine.  
**[0:00:16-0:00:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:16):**  The webinar poses the question, what does Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the global  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:21):**  response to this war tell us about global food production and food systems more broadly?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:26):**  The discussion took place on Zoom, which means that the audio quality is not quite up to  
**[0:00:31-0:00:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:31):**  our usual high standard and the programme has not been edited in the normal way.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:35):**  That said, the quality, the insight from our guests was immense and I hope that you'll  
**[0:00:40-0:00:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:40):**  take the time to listen to this conversation. Thank you for joining us. I'm Finnlow Costayne,  
**[0:00:45-0:00:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:45):**  the founder of the Food and Global Security Network. I'm joined today by a superb international  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:50):**  panel. Chantelle Weiyin-Clemol is the deputy director of IPES Food based in Brussels.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:56):**  Juna Mikkola is the founder of Soil Watch and he comes from Finland and lives and works  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:00):**  in the Sahel in Sudan. Sue Pritchard is the chief executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside  
**[0:01:06-0:01:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:06):**  Commission based in the UK. And sadly, we were to be joined by Rekonaldo Hasid Marroquin,  
**[0:01:11-0:01:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:11):**  but Rekhi has unfortunately been caught out in a storm in rural South Dakota and has no  
**[0:01:16-0:01:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:16):**  signal, which is a great pity. He'll be greatly missed. I'm going to lead the discussion with  
**[0:01:21-0:01:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:21):**  our panelists, after which we'll go to you, the audience. So please put any questions  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:26):**  that you have into the chat box as we go along and feel free to introduce yourselves to each  
**[0:01:30-0:01:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:30):**  other as well. So I want to set the scene. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is brutal and  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:38):**  unprovoked and it's correct that the international community has come to the aid of the Ukrainian  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:43):**  people. But the mainstream media narrative of good guys and bad guys, no matter how understandable  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:49):**  is unhelpful and oversimplifies important practical and ethical questions around conflict,  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:55):**  political motivations and the balancing of strategic global power. So we need to take  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:00):**  a step back to reflect on the origins of this conflict and a step forward, because this  
**[0:02:05-0:02:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:05):**  war is almost certainly just a foretaste of the violence and insecurity to come in the  
**[0:02:11-0:02:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:11):**  next few decades as ecological breakdown, access to food and geopolitical instability  
**[0:02:16-0:02:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:16):**  become welded fundamentally together. President Putin is a megalomaniac, but he's not an idiot.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:24):**  His economy is built on what seemed once to be the hard rock of fossil fuels. But climate  
**[0:02:29-0:02:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:29):**  change has undermined these foundations and much needed global policy to reduce carbon  
**[0:02:34-0:02:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:34):**  emissions will increasingly strand Russia's fossil fuel assets. The Russian economy has  
**[0:02:40-0:02:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:40):**  therefore become vulnerable to ecological instability, and many more nations will find  
**[0:02:46-0:02:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:46):**  themselves in similar positions to a lesser or greater extent. So we're now facing a great  
**[0:02:52-0:02:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:52):**  geopolitical restructuring as national governments attempt to identify new economic strengths  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:58):**  and to capture control of alternative assets. After fossil fuels, Russia's next biggest  
**[0:03:03-0:03:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:03):**  export is cereal. Russia was the world's third biggest producer of wheat in 2020. And if  
**[0:03:10-0:03:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:10):**  it successfully claims Ukraine, which is the world's sixth biggest producer, it will control  
**[0:03:14-0:03:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:14):**  up to 30% of the world's supply of this staple ingredient. Now, I want to be clear, I'm not  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:21):**  suggesting that Putin invaded Ukraine simply because of climate policy or the desire for  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:27):**  grain. What I am saying is that these are critical underlying elements that factor into  
**[0:03:33-0:03:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:33):**  Putin's strategic thinking, and which will inevitably factor into the thinking of other  
**[0:03:37-0:03:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:37):**  leaders in the future. Food ingredients, as a result of a distorted global food commodity  
**[0:03:43-0:03:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:43):**  system, have tremendous economic value and are becoming critical strategic assets. Ownership  
**[0:03:49-0:03:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:49):**  of these commodities and control over their routes to market, particularly transportation  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:54):**  pinch points, can be weaponised. And while access to nutrition helps to maintain social  
**[0:03:59-0:04:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:59):**  stability, hunger, poverty and resentment can quickly lead people into conflict. Ecology,  
**[0:04:06-0:04:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:06):**  food and political stability have become intrinsically linked. So what does the current conflict  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:12):**  tell us about the state of the global food system today? And if, as we believe, agroecology  
**[0:04:18-0:04:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:18):**  and regenerative agriculture are the long term solutions, then what does the rhetoric  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:23):**  from governments and farmers urging a return to the most intensive forms of farming as  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:28):**  a response to the Ukrainian conflict tell us about the political progress that we're  
**[0:04:33-0:04:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:33):**  actually making? Let me come first to you, Junor, Michaela  
**[0:04:36-0:04:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:36):**  from Soil Watch. The people living in the Sahel are some of the poorest in the world,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:42):**  and food insecurity is already high. What's been driving this food insecurity over the  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:48):**  last few decades, and how has Russia's invasion of Ukraine made things worse?  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:53):**  Yeah, thanks, Jindla, and thanks for the introduction and also for the opportunity of being here.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:58):**  Yeah, it's actually quite an interesting and scary situation here, because as you said,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:05):**  we've been facing worse in the food security situation here. COVID made it worse. It kind  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:12):**  of impacted the commodity supply chains, and now we have the Ukraine war as well. What  
**[0:05:18-0:05:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:18):**  has been going on in the last couple of decades can maybe be called as a vicious circle of  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:26):**  land degradation. We have unsustainable agricultural practices and overgrazing and really quickly  
**[0:05:33-0:05:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:33):**  growing both human and livestock population. That has led to basically a decrease in soil  
**[0:05:41-0:05:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:41):**  organic batter in the farmlands. Traditionally, people used to practice here what is called  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:46):**  shifting agriculture, where they farm an area for a couple of years, and then they move  
**[0:05:50-0:05:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:50):**  ahead and again abandon it, and then they cut down forests and the native vegetation.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:59):**  What's been driving the food insecurity is actually land degradation drives it in two  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:03):**  ways. We have decreasing yields here, unlike most parts of the world where the yields have  
**[0:06:08-0:06:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:08):**  been increasing in the past couple of decades. Also, less feed available for livestock, but  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:15):**  then that actually causes something similar to resource conflict. We have a more and more  
**[0:06:21-0:06:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:21):**  pressure, bigger population over less and less natural resources, and that is driving  
**[0:06:28-0:06:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:28):**  conflict across the area, across all Sahel. It's 7,000 kilometres from Senegal to Djibouti.  
**[0:06:35-0:06:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:35):**  And then as there is more and more conflict, then there's more and more displaced people.  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:39):**  And then when people are displaced, they cannot produce food anymore. So, conflict is also  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:44):**  another driver of food insecurity. Correct me if I'm wrong, Gino, but the food  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:50):**  insecurity in the Sahel has increased, hasn't it, over the last two or three decades, partly  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:55):**  because of the entry into the global market, not only subsistence farming taking place  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:02):**  as it has done for decades and centuries before, but because people there have been entering  
**[0:07:07-0:07:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:07):**  into the global market and selling into the global market.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:10):**  Yeah, so partly for instance in Sudan, in the 70s, the livestock population was about  
**[0:07:15-0:07:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:15):**  40 million heads, and now it's 140 million. Most of that goes as exports to the Gulf state.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:21):**  And before a lot of people, they were producing food, keeping livestock also, it was a kind  
**[0:07:27-0:07:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:27):**  of storage of wealth, and then for their own consumption. And when they were kind of connected  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:32):**  with the market economy, they started to increase the herd size as well. So, it's definitely  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:37):**  there as part to play. And then as well, also access to cheap commodities from abroad, from  
**[0:07:44-0:07:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:44):**  the global market has also then led to really quick increase in population as well.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:48):**  And now what we're seeing now with the Ukrainian war, suddenly the seed commodities are not  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:52):**  there anymore. What happened last time when the wheat price went up, it caused the Arab  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:57):**  Spring in these areas. So, now in a very dire situation here at the moment.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:03):**  What sort of impacts on the ground have resulted from the Ukraine conflict?  
**[0:08:08-0:08:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:08):**  So why it impacts so much all of Africa and North Africa is because, and maybe the Middle  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:15):**  East, these countries, they import a lot of wheat from Ukraine and from Russia. And then  
**[0:08:21-0:08:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:21):**  also we have very large parts of the population. They live with a very couple of dollars per  
**[0:08:28-0:08:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:28):**  day. So, when it doesn't really hurt us that much in the West, when let's say the bread  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:35):**  prices double, it does really hurt those people who most of their income really goes to buying,  
**[0:08:42-0:08:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:42):**  for instance, wheat. And that will, that last time that happened, it increased, it led to  
**[0:08:48-0:08:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:48):**  the Arab Spring, a lot of popular unrest. And yeah, we are quite scared to see what  
**[0:08:55-0:08:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:55):**  will happen in the coming months in this area.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:58):**  Now, Juno, just thinking about the food insecurity and the way that it's risen over the last  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:03):**  few decades, and now with this layering on top of this conflict in Ukraine, you've said  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:08):**  to me in the past that when you run out of old tricks, the things that we usually do,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:13):**  then you need new tricks. I just wonder what do you think those new tricks are and how  
**[0:09:18-0:09:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:18):**  are donors and international agencies changing their approach to dealing with hunger in the  
**[0:09:23-0:09:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:23):**  Sahara?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:24):**  Yeah, so yeah, we've been actually having a couple of meetings lately with the different  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:28):**  UN agencies and donors and trying to kind of brainstorm that what we can do now when  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:34):**  we don't have access to these cheap commodities. And obviously, then the most obvious answer  
**[0:09:40-0:09:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:40):**  is that how can we increase the food production in these countries? And if you ask me, that  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:47):**  should be the focus from the first point. For a long time, there was kind of an idea  
**[0:09:52-0:09:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:52):**  of some kind of a competitive advantage and that said that countries would be producing  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:56):**  wheat and other countries would be importing it. But as we see now, there's maybe one more  
**[0:10:03-0:10:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:03):**  focus on supply chain resilience, especially when it comes to food. So that's a really  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:08):**  good thing. And I would say that also, I work mainly with the land recorders and drivers  
**[0:10:15-0:10:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:15):**  of land recorders. When you invest in sustainable food systems in these countries, you're not  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:21):**  only investing in food security, but it's also a climate act. When we produce more per  
**[0:10:28-0:10:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:28):**  hectare, that means that there's lessened conversion of natural habitat into cropland.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:36):**  So that's a very positive direction that should have happened earlier. But I think now the  
**[0:10:41-0:10:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:41):**  pressure is really piling up that the countries together with the donors, with the UN agencies  
**[0:10:48-0:10:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:48):**  and even the private sector, we're looking at that how can we invest in sustainable food  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:52):**  production in these countries. Fantastic. Thanks so much, Junot. Let me  
**[0:10:55-0:11:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:55):**  turn to you, Chantelle Weying-Clement from IPES Food. If this war is the beginning of  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:01):**  a geopolitical restructuring linked to ecological insecurity with food becoming not only a strategic  
**[0:11:07-0:11:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:07):**  commodity but also a weaponized asset, how do food systems and food system governance  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:14):**  need to respond and change? Honestly, my first thought when I heard your  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:18):**  question was, you know, is this war the beginning of major global restructuring? You know, aren't  
**[0:11:23-0:11:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:23):**  we just actually continuing patterns of geopolitics that have existed for centuries but with slightly  
**[0:11:27-0:11:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:27):**  different players? I think food has been used, you said this rightly in the introduction,  
**[0:11:31-0:11:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:31):**  it's been used as a strategic asset in many contexts before this one. You know, going  
**[0:11:35-0:11:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:35):**  back to the sieges centuries ago to, you know, to today. And I think I was looking this up,  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:39):**  I think it was in 1974 that the USDA secretary coined the phrase, you know, food is a weapon  
**[0:11:45-0:11:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:45):**  when US was shaping its foreign aid policy. So again, you know, these ideas far predate  
**[0:11:49-0:11:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:49):**  where we are today. But, you know, fast forward to 50 years later and we're actually in a  
**[0:11:53-0:11:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:53):**  very similar situation, just playing out against the backdrop of climate change, half a century  
**[0:11:57-0:12:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:57):**  of globalization. So really, everything is just so much more amplified. But you know,  
**[0:12:02-0:12:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:02):**  in terms of how do food systems need to respond and change, I think a first step really is  
**[0:12:07-0:12:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:07):**  a lot of the things that Jooma already said, it's really just to acknowledge that food  
**[0:12:11-0:12:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:11):**  systems have been failing us far before this crisis started. And these failures are wrapped  
**[0:12:15-0:12:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:15):**  up in these broader structural issues related to governance and power. You know, certainly  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:19):**  the invasion of Ukraine is what has sparked another food crisis or food price crisis.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:24):**  And I'd specify that this is the third food price crisis in only 15 years. But you know,  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:29):**  we know our food systems are part of a much bigger, much longer story about lack of access,  
**[0:12:33-0:12:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:33):**  lack of distribution, poverty, debt. And I think the numbers from the UN Food and Agricultural  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:38):**  Organization report on food insecurity was just released this week. And it confirms all  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:43):**  of this, you know, the state of hunger and malnutrition in the world today, because of  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:47):**  COVID conflict, etc, are basically the same as they were in 2015. So 2015 2016, when we  
**[0:12:54-0:12:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:54):**  created the UN Sustainable Development Goals to overcome these challenges, but that's extremely  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:58):**  troubling to think that in that amount of time, we've essentially achieved very little,  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:03):**  you know, our food systems really just shouldn't be this vulnerable to disruption. So I think,  
**[0:13:08-0:13:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:08):**  you know, if the Ukraine conflict ended tomorrow, we'd still be facing some kind of global food  
**[0:13:12-0:13:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:12):**  crisis because of something else, you know, our reliance on chemical inputs, because of  
**[0:13:16-0:13:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:16):**  the impacts of our agricultural practices on natural resources on the soil, as was already  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:20):**  said, you know, because of ongoing health pandemics, there's always something around  
**[0:13:23-0:13:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:23):**  the corner. And really, you know, because of the very structures, if I can use the C  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:27):**  word, you know, of capitalism, to be honest, you know, which is enriching some actors like  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:31):**  big grain traders, commodity speculators, input companies, and you know, these are being  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:35):**  furthered by our national governments, their agricultural trade and aid policies for decades,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:40):**  you know, to the detriment of our world's most vulnerable populations, farmers included.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:45):**  So again, first step, I think, let's just acknowledge that and take a really hard look  
**[0:13:48-0:13:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:48):**  at the systems and the structures that are in place that got us here in the first place.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:52):**  You mentioned there the reliance on chemical inputs, and, you know, the role of capitalism  
**[0:13:57-0:14:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:57):**  and speculation. I just wonder if there are other sort of structural issues that you're  
**[0:14:01-0:14:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:01):**  aware of at IPES. Yeah, I mean, I think Juma talked about an  
**[0:14:05-0:14:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:05):**  important one, which is just dependence, you know, dependence on imports, and this logic  
**[0:14:10-0:14:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:10):**  that has structured globalization around this kind of logic of export orientation, comparative  
**[0:14:14-0:14:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:14):**  advantage, those kinds of things. So, you know, we talk, we can talk about speculation,  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:19):**  we can talk about debt, you know, perhaps at a later stage, but you know, it's again,  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:22):**  it's the global structures of how we, you know, how we shape trade agreements, how we  
**[0:14:27-0:14:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:27):**  structure trade, how we structure humanitarian aid relief, as well as kind of part of all  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:31):**  of this. All that being said, there are some very practical and positive solutions happening  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:35):**  on the ground. But you know, these can only be scaled up and really be meaningful, you  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:40):**  know, if we look at this whole system that's really tamping down on these positive efforts.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:45):**  Well, let's focus for a moment on that scaling, if you like, because each of us on this call  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:49):**  is involved in some way in the political effort to make agroecology mainstream. And so, I  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:55):**  guess the simple question is, when you're within this bubble that we live in, it feels  
**[0:15:00-0:15:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:00):**  like we're making progress. But actually, when you start to see that progress sort of  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:06):**  dribbling away, perhaps as a result of the Ukraine conflict, the question is, are we  
**[0:15:10-0:15:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:10):**  winning? And how is the war in Ukraine affecting the political argument for change at a European  
**[0:15:16-0:15:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:16):**  Union level?  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:17):**  I think it's good to maybe remain a bit positive, because there's so much bad news going on  
**[0:15:21-0:15:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:21):**  at the moment. But, you know, as we know, agroecology, it's not just a set of agricultural  
**[0:15:25-0:15:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:25):**  practices, you know, it's a whole framing, it's a paradigm, it's really just a shift  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:28):**  in mindset of how we do food systems differently. You know, and this can be a really hard thing  
**[0:15:33-0:15:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:33):**  to pitch to those in power who've been maintaining the status quo for decades. You know, but  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:38):**  at the same time, this is really a moment of opportunity, right? This crisis, or these  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:42):**  repeated crises have brought all this to light. So I like to think that on a global scale,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:47):**  we are slowly but surely gaining ground. I think before I get to the EU, you know, you  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:51):**  might have heard of the Agroecology Coalition, which was created last year in the aftermath  
**[0:15:56-0:16:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:56):**  of the UN Food System Summit. That's a whole other topic. But, you know, this coalition  
**[0:16:00-0:16:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:00):**  now brings together, I think, 34, 30 some governments and other actors willing to mainstream  
**[0:16:05-0:16:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:05):**  agroecology. And unsurprisingly, many of these countries are countries from the global south,  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:10):**  you know, those who've been forced into a global system that doesn't work to their advantage.  
**[0:16:15-0:16:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:15):**  You know, I think in West Africa, we're seeing Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali, really increasing  
**[0:16:19-0:16:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:19):**  their focus on agroecological production. As a result of the crisis, we also just saw  
**[0:16:24-0:16:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:24):**  Ghana announced a progressive shift towards organic fertilizers to curb rising input costs.  
**[0:16:29-0:16:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:29):**  You know, if we look beyond grain, you know, which is really the main topic of this crisis,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:33):**  we're seeing countries as well, many vulnerable countries who are actually self-sufficient  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:37):**  in local staple crops, like millet, like sorghum, you know, things that are climate resilient,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:42):**  locally adapted, locally consumed, you know, all of this kind of fitting under the umbrella  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:45):**  of agroecology. You know, and we can we can go elsewhere as well. But all around the world,  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:49):**  we're seeing these kind of pockets of opportunity and hope. In the EU, though, I think you're  
**[0:16:53-0:16:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:53):**  right that we really saw, especially I think in March at the start of this crisis, these  
**[0:16:58-0:17:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:58):**  two very opposing visions for food systems really being amplified by the crisis. Specifically,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:03):**  I saw, unsurprisingly, it kind of came from the agricultural side or the agricultural  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:08):**  policy side, that we saw these real efforts from the agricultural commissioner to hold  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:13):**  off implementation of some of the EU's most sustainable food policies under the farm to  
**[0:17:17-0:17:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:17):**  fork strategy. So things like questioning pesticide directives, questioning nature restoration  
**[0:17:23-0:17:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:23):**  laws. And that was that was really worrying. But luckily, I think the commission vice president,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:28):**  so Hans Timmerman, has really held his ground, I think, to preserve the EU's sustainability  
**[0:17:33-0:17:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:33):**  ambitions, because he and his team are really thinking about long term resilience over short  
**[0:17:38-0:17:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:38):**  term productivity. And I think, you know, that's that's not something to be taken lightly.  
**[0:17:43-0:17:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:43):**  I think they agroecology was explicitly mentioned as a means to create long term resilience  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:49):**  to crises in communications from the Commission on safeguarding food security a few months  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:54):**  ago. And I think now we're seeing some of this language being backed up by the proposal  
**[0:17:59-0:18:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:59):**  just put out by the commission last week, as part of the more specifics of the biodiversity  
**[0:18:05-0:18:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:05):**  and farm to fork strategies, including legally binding targets, which is really how we get  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:09):**  anywhere. So that kind of thing is really exciting. But of course, you know, this is  
**[0:18:13-0:18:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:13):**  just a proposal, it has to go to the parliament has to go to the council. So at this point,  
**[0:18:17-0:18:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:17):**  it's really up to member states up to the parliament to stand up and support these ambitions  
**[0:18:23-0:18:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:23):**  and not just torpedo the whole process and let things get watered down as as it goes  
**[0:18:27-0:18:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:27):**  through the political process.  
**[0:18:28-0:18:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:28):**  I agree with you that it's been really interesting to see and really and really positive to see  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:32):**  the response of the commission in the face of this, this attempt to slow progress around  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:38):**  farm to fork that they really have kind of held held to the line that they need to make  
**[0:18:43-0:18:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:43):**  progress and think for the longer term. But I'm just just thinking about that, that sort  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:47):**  of coalition of agricultural interests that was that was pushing the commission to hold  
**[0:18:51-0:18:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:51):**  off on the farm to fork. I'm wondering whether you see the Ukraine conflict, whether they  
**[0:18:57-0:19:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:57):**  were simply being opportunistic and, and decided that this was a really good way of managing  
**[0:19:02-0:19:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:02):**  some PR and trying to, to advocate for the old status quo from the commission, or whether  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:08):**  they were coming from a position of genuine fear about the changes that were going to  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:15):**  come through the farm to fork strategy, whether they were genuinely nervous that farm to fork  
**[0:19:19-0:19:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:19):**  wouldn't be able to deliver food for people in Europe.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:23):**  Sure. I think firstly, to be honest, we're all using this as a kind of PR opportunity  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:27):**  to push for, you know, the values that we believe in. But I think there was genuinely  
**[0:19:32-0:19:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:32):**  always some fear, I think, around the direction of the farm to fork strategy from some constituents,  
**[0:19:37-0:19:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:37):**  specifically around productivity, specifically around yields, but really just because nobody  
**[0:19:42-0:19:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:42):**  likes to shake up the status quo. And I think it's been interesting to hear the commission's  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:47):**  language around some of this because they are supporting agroecology. But this is coming  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:52):**  out alongside a lot of business as usual language as well. So a lot of talk about increasing  
**[0:19:57-0:20:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:57):**  productivity, you know, sort of new breeds research into, you know, new technological  
**[0:20:02-0:20:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:02):**  strategies for climate resilience. So a lot of this is being said, but in a pretty contradictory  
**[0:20:08-0:20:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:08):**  way, because, you know, again, politically, I think you're trying to appeal to all audiences.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:12):**  But I think, you know, from a lobbying perspective, perhaps, I think there was some real fear  
**[0:20:19-0:20:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:19):**  that we are changing the models on which we're basing our systems at the moment. You know,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:23):**  we're pointing to many things beyond this conflict, we can talk about livestock, we  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:26):**  can talk about monocultures, etc. These things are all being threatened by the commission's  
**[0:20:31-0:20:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:31):**  current direction. So, you know, of course, of course, there is genuine fear that these  
**[0:20:34-0:20:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:34):**  things will be phased out as we move forward. Sue Pritchard from the Food, Farming and Countryside  
**[0:20:40-0:20:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:40):**  Commission in the UK. You're based here in Great Britain. What impact has the war had  
**[0:20:46-0:20:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:46):**  on the political appetite for agroecology in Britain, do you think? And perhaps more  
**[0:20:49-0:20:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:49):**  importantly, how do you think the war is affecting actual food production on the ground?  
**[0:20:55-0:21:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:55):**  Thanks, everyone. Just really loving listening to Chantal and Juna just really cutting to  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:02):**  the chase about what the what the big structural issues are. So I'm sure we'll talk more about  
**[0:21:06-0:21:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:06):**  that shortly. Without a doubt, the war in Ukraine, and the conditions that Chantal has  
**[0:21:13-0:21:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:13):**  already listed, before that has encouraged the kind of productivist mindset in the UK,  
**[0:21:23-0:21:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:23):**  those farmers and growers who have, you know, often for very, very good reasons. At their  
**[0:21:31-0:21:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:31):**  absolute heart and soul, this desire to feed the world, that the point of them being farmers  
**[0:21:37-0:21:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:37):**  is to, to feed the world and to feed the world as efficiently and as effectively as possible.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:43):**  In the last decade or so as the as the shift to more agroecological or regenerative paradigms  
**[0:21:51-0:21:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:51):**  has started to really grow. Those farmers who are deeply rooted in the productivist  
**[0:21:58-0:22:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:58):**  paradigm have perhaps struggled. Now, that that all being said, many of them, many farmers  
**[0:22:06-0:22:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:06):**  have already made the kinds of changes that that shift towards more regenerative farming  
**[0:22:13-0:22:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:13):**  practices, and therefore have alleviated some of the shocks that others have faced the rising  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:23):**  price of fertilizers and inputs, for example, energy costs, fuel costs. And so for those  
**[0:22:29-0:22:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:29):**  who already made the transition, they are feeling very grateful, let's say that they've  
**[0:22:37-0:22:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:37):**  already made those shifts. For farmers who have been waiting for clearer signals, clearer  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:46):**  policy signals from our own government, about the real direction of travel of farm policy  
**[0:22:51-0:23:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:51):**  in the UK. They have, I think, started to take much stronger signals from the market.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:02):**  And so for particular commodities, as both Shantal and Julia have already said, those  
**[0:23:10-0:23:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:10):**  commodity prices are going sky high. And farmers who can are really trying to maximize their  
**[0:23:18-0:23:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:18):**  production from their land holdings. So in my area, where I live in Wales, I farm in  
**[0:23:23-0:23:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:23):**  Wales, where I live in Wales, when I go for a walk around the lanes now, I can see that  
**[0:23:28-0:23:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:28):**  some of my neighbors are plowing right up to the hedges and right down to the stream  
**[0:23:35-0:23:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:35):**  corridors. Whereas just last year, they'd left two meter boundaries, and riparian corridors  
**[0:23:45-0:23:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:45):**  to protect habitats and to support wildlife corridors. Those environmental gains are already  
**[0:23:54-0:23:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:54):**  lost.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:55):**  And why is that happening, Sue? Is it a response to Ukraine and the idea that they are suddenly  
**[0:24:00-0:24:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:00):**  somehow responsible for, you know, all of the food that everybody eats around the world?  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:04):**  Or is it a response to transitions in environmental legislation in the UK arising, perhaps from  
**[0:24:11-0:24:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:11):**  Brexit and the reorganization of the way that British farmers relate to the replacement  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:16):**  for the Common Agricultural Policy?  
**[0:24:18-0:24:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:18):**  I think we're at a point in time where some of the taken for granted assumptions of what  
**[0:24:27-0:24:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:27):**  kind of food system we need in the planet have been really challenged. And we are bringing  
**[0:24:35-0:24:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:35):**  to fruition a new set of practices, but also principles and values about how food systems  
**[0:24:44-0:24:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:44):**  should be in the future. They should not harm the planet, they should be more equitable,  
**[0:24:49-0:24:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:49):**  more inclusive, more fair. The principles that are embodied really well in agroecology.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:57):**  But I think, again, Chantal named it very clearly. Even though we can point to all of  
**[0:25:06-0:25:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:06):**  the detrimental effects that the old food system has had on land and on health, on water  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:15):**  quality, on air quality around the world, we have to be very cognizant of the fact that  
**[0:25:20-0:25:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:20):**  there are still some very powerful beneficiaries of the current system. And as we work and  
**[0:25:29-0:25:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:29):**  collaborate across agencies, across organizations, across nations to try and bring a new paradigm  
**[0:25:36-0:25:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:36):**  into being, I think it would be naive of us not to recognize that the old world does not  
**[0:25:44-0:25:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:44):**  die quietly. And a phrase I've been using quite a lot recently is that for all the work  
**[0:25:50-0:25:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:50):**  that we talk about, about midwifing the new into being, using either public policy or  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:57):**  other tools and instruments, we also have to think really quite hard about hospicing  
**[0:26:02-0:26:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:02):**  the old and helping the old world die more effectively. The old values, the old ideas,  
**[0:26:10-0:26:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:10):**  the old ways of doing business, they have to be helped to come to an end really much  
**[0:26:17-0:26:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:17):**  more quickly. And that's at the heart of conversations around what a just transition looks like.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:22):**  I mean, just one slightly shocking stat that I was reminded of when I was preparing for  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:29):**  the conversation today. The sorts of things that we're talking about here and now are  
**[0:26:33-0:26:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:33):**  being talked about in a very animated way at Davos just a few weeks ago. And David Beasley,  
**[0:26:42-0:26:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:42):**  the United Nations World Food Programme lead, was pointing out the incredible urgency and  
**[0:26:49-0:26:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:49):**  seriousness of the war in Ukraine on food security, on hunger, on starvation in particular  
**[0:26:56-0:27:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:56):**  parts of the world. But alongside that particular burning platform, he reminded us that the  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:02):**  net worth of the richest, many of whom were at Davos, increased by 5.2 billion pounds  
**[0:27:09-0:27:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:09):**  per day in the last year. 5.2 billion pounds a day. Now, one of the things that I think  
**[0:27:18-0:27:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:18):**  we probably do need to come on to fairly quickly in this conversation is the willingness of  
**[0:27:26-0:27:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:26):**  governments and of international governance arrangements to require that the wealthy pay  
**[0:27:33-0:27:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:33):**  much more of their fair share to rebalance inequalities around the world. And that's  
**[0:27:42-0:27:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:42):**  not that's not a kind of that shouldn't be that shouldn't be a kind of polite request  
**[0:27:48-0:27:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:48):**  anymore. It should become an absolute requirement of of a civilised planet that the richest  
**[0:27:56-0:28:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:56):**  don't have a voluntary option to pay appropriate taxes and appropriate contributions proportionate  
**[0:28:04-0:28:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:04):**  to their wealth. They must be required to do so because anything else is just just outrageously  
**[0:28:12-0:28:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:12):**  unfair.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:13):**  So, I completely take that point. And Chantelle, I want to come back to you in just a moment.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:17):**  But before I do, you were talking about the market. I'm just wondering, you know, whether  
**[0:28:22-0:28:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:22):**  and perhaps this is what you were indicating that the way in which the war has pushed up  
**[0:28:26-0:28:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:26):**  the prices of fertiliser and other things. If there are people who have been interested  
**[0:28:31-0:28:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:31):**  in agroecology, but they haven't quite taken the plunge, do you think that this has helped  
**[0:28:36-0:28:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:36):**  to create a market driven response that's positive in terms of delivering not only well,  
**[0:28:44-0:28:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:44):**  delivering some environmental benefit as well as this challenge that you were talking about,  
**[0:28:47-0:28:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:47):**  about farmers ploughing right up to the fence, etc.?  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:51):**  I think for some people it has. But I mean, the reality is that a transition to regenerative  
**[0:28:56-0:29:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:56):**  practices doesn't happen overnight. So you just take out fertilisers from farms, you  
**[0:29:03-0:29:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:03):**  will have a drop in yields. Now, you can absolutely mitigate that in a managed transition to more  
**[0:29:09-0:29:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:09):**  generative practices using organic manures and different tilling practices. But the reality  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:16):**  is, if you're going to make a rapid change from one year to the next, you're going to  
**[0:29:20-0:29:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:20):**  take a hit on yields. And so lots of farmers have been making real kind of accountancy  
**[0:29:28-0:29:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:28):**  led decisions about the price they're anticipating getting for their arable crops next year,  
**[0:29:38-0:29:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:38):**  and the massively increased cost of those inputs. So different farmers in different  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:45):**  places with different opportunities, different bank balances, frankly, different appetites  
**[0:29:52-0:30:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:52):**  for risk are making different kinds of decisions, because the market signals are very erratic  
**[0:30:03-0:30:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:03):**  at the moment. And certainly in the UK, our government has not yet given the clearest  
**[0:30:14-0:30:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:14):**  form of leadership that it could in the transition from one set of farm support payments to a  
**[0:30:20-0:30:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:20):**  new set of farm support payments, and also being prepared to tackle the additional issues  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:26):**  of food insecurity, food poverty, health, nutrition, wellbeing.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:29):**  Chantelle, I want to come on to that issue of potentially taxing, you know, wherever  
**[0:30:34-0:30:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:34):**  that money comes from, whether it's from the richest or wherever, and spending and where  
**[0:30:42-0:30:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:42):**  that spending goes. And as we know, healthy living soil and a vibrant ecology are vital  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:48):**  for a nation's resilience and its strategic strength. And in response to the war, we've  
**[0:30:52-0:30:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:52):**  heard an awful lot about increased military spending or increasing military spending.  
**[0:30:58-0:31:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:58):**  But is it the case that genuine national defence and security should also require more investment  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:05):**  in agroecological food production and food system reform?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:08):**  I mean, sure, absolutely. Of course, as we said earlier, food security is national security  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:13):**  to a large extent. And if we want agroecology to have any chance to thrive within the current  
**[0:31:18-0:31:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:18):**  context or future context, we have to create the incentives to allow farmers to adopt agroecology,  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:23):**  as we said, diversify their production, protect lands, etc., reduce dependence on external  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:28):**  inputs. But yes, this is going to require major investment, major support. And the interesting  
**[0:31:33-0:31:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:33):**  thing is, while financing is usually the tricky part of the conversation, we actually already  
**[0:31:38-0:31:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:38):**  have, you know, we have that covered. I think the FAO report that I like to cite that was  
**[0:31:42-0:31:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:42):**  released last year stated that 90% of the, I think, $540 billion spent on global agricultural  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:48):**  subsidies per year are harmful. They're harmful to people, they're harmful to the planet,  
**[0:31:53-0:31:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:53):**  that's 90%. So, you know, redirecting even a fraction of that in the right direction  
**[0:31:58-0:32:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:58):**  could have a huge impact. Subsidies and public policies can't keep locking us into these  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:03):**  systems that, you know, as I said, are failing us. And many, you know, including the EU that  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:08):**  I mentioned earlier, are starting to talk about this strategically in the context of  
**[0:32:11-0:32:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:11):**  food security. And I think what's been interesting on this kind of finance part is that there's  
**[0:32:15-0:32:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:15):**  also been a big push within climate debates to increase climate finance for agroecology,  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:20):**  climate finance for regenerative solutions. So, you know, looking ahead to climate negotiations  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:23):**  later this year, you know, beyond kind of the food crisis, I'm really hoping and suspecting  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:27):**  that there's going to be a lot more talk about climate finance for food systems change, and  
**[0:32:32-0:32:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:32):**  specifically agroecology in those spaces. So, you know, perhaps another avenue of possibility  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:36):**  to support what we're doing. You know, but beyond that, I think we're, we've already  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:40):**  seen more support, you know, I mentioned the EU, but we just saw, I think last month, the  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:45):**  USDA announced an additional $300 million to support farmers to transition to organic.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:50):**  This is a really small amount compared to the billions they're investing in, in other  
**[0:32:54-0:32:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:54):**  types of agriculture. But you know, it's, it's a step in the right direction. So, I  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:57):**  think, you know, we just have to take these as wins and keep building from there.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:00):**  And within that farm to fork strategy, there is, and the discussion around agroecology,  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:04):**  rather than simply, you know, regenerative farm management, there is that conversation  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:09):**  where there is at least an ambition now to start trying to reconnect climate outcomes  
**[0:33:15-0:33:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:15):**  with, with biodiversity outcomes, with social outcomes, and, and a sort of a redistribution  
**[0:33:22-0:33:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:22):**  of money so that we're valuing smaller farmers as well as larger farmers. Is that right?  
**[0:33:27-0:33:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:27):**  Yeah, absolutely. I think what you're saying is, is exactly on the mark that, you know,  
**[0:33:30-0:33:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:30):**  we have to not just talk about better agricultural practices. You know, we already said, it's  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:34):**  also about how we distribute food, improve income, you know, develop the right social  
**[0:33:38-0:33:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:38):**  safety nets, so everyone can afford and access healthy foods. I think at the international  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:42):**  level, you know, that again, I'm stressing this again, that means talking about debt  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:45):**  relief, or even debt cancellation, because these vulnerable countries, they, they need  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:50):**  the funds to invest in the infrastructures and programs that are needed. You know, at  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:54):**  the national level, we can talk about ambitious anti-hunger programs. We've seen them in Brazil  
**[0:33:58-0:34:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:58):**  in the past, you know, supporting local and regional markets, which has already been mentioned.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:03):**  So really, we are talking about a system-wide revamp that, you know, needs financing, not  
**[0:34:07-0:34:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:07):**  just, not just production methods. I noticed that we're, we're running on in  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:11):**  terms of time. So, I'm going to move on to the next issue. And Sue, just thinking about  
**[0:34:15-0:34:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:15):**  the Arab Spring, where an increase in the price of bread led to, led just about coping  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:20):**  communities into protest and ultimately into revolution, and thinking about what's happening  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:24):**  in Sahel now, as Juno explained earlier, what should Western governments be doing right  
**[0:34:29-0:34:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:29):**  now to alleviate pressure on global markets and on the world's poorest people?  
**[0:34:34-0:34:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:34):**  So, it's very, very clear to me that Western governments need to take, take their responsibilities  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:42):**  really seriously in investing in sustainable and agroecological practices in those most  
**[0:34:48-0:34:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:48):**  vulnerable countries. I think we're all very alert and anxious about some global initiatives  
**[0:34:57-0:35:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:57):**  which turn their attention to the global south, but do so in an extractive and instrumental  
**[0:35:03-0:35:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:03):**  way that how certain, certain corporates or certain institutions can incorporate countries  
**[0:35:15-0:35:20](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:15):**  in the global south into a globalized food market by, by enticing them into that kind  
**[0:35:20-0:35:30](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:20):**  of monoculture and, and commodity led set of systems. But I think in, in West Western  
**[0:35:30-0:35:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:30):**  countries and in the global north, we absolutely have to be investing in the sorts of heterogeneous  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:38):**  farming practices and locally contextually relevant farming practices that enable countries  
**[0:35:44-0:35:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:44):**  to have a better chance of feeding themselves. That's, that's a critical role for, for development  
**[0:35:52-0:35:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:52):**  aid. At the moment, we're cutting our aid budget in the UK, which is horrifying and  
**[0:35:57-0:36:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:57):**  shocking at a time when we need to be investing much more in the alleviating policies that  
**[0:36:05-0:36:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:05):**  support countries who are experiencing not just the Ukraine impacts, but climate impacts.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:13):**  Again, Chantal and Juna listed those right at the start. We are, we are continuing on  
**[0:36:19-0:36:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:19):**  a trajectory where crisis after crisis after crisis is the, is the future that was foretold  
**[0:36:27-0:36:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:27):**  20, 30 years ago. This, this level of, of, of disruption and turbulence as a result of  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:38):**  the decisions that we didn't make then and are still failing to make now was it was what  
**[0:36:44-0:36:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:44):**  what we expected. So it's incumbent, I think, upon governments in the global north to be  
**[0:36:52-0:37:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:52):**  investing as, as a, as an absolute responsibility, kind of obviously kind of anti colonial responsibility,  
**[0:37:00-0:37:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:00):**  a reparations project to ensure that countries in the global south can meet their minimum  
**[0:37:07-0:37:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:07):**  needs. And that actually does mean us in the global north, having some really hard conversations  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:13):**  with ourselves about how much planetary resources we're quite prepared to suck up and waste  
**[0:37:18-0:37:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:18):**  for things that really on are not that important to the quality of our lives. So there's a  
**[0:37:26-0:37:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:26):**  big conversation I think for us in the global north to have about how we, how we think about  
**[0:37:31-0:37:40](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:31):**  demand and consumption, and, and how how far we're prepared to start introducing policies  
**[0:37:40-0:37:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:40):**  that moderate demand, and that engage citizens in those really kind of straight conversations  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:49):**  that it's for us in the global north, it is our demand on the planetary resources that  
**[0:37:54-0:38:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:54):**  is causing it's a direct cause of the crises that we are we're talking about here.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:01):**  You've talked about investment a lot there, and you started talking there about market  
**[0:38:04-0:38:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:04):**  forces and governments are always very reluctant to intervene in the market, at least they  
**[0:38:09-0:38:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:09):**  say they are, even if, you know, interventions do happen. And so I want to see as we move  
**[0:38:14-0:38:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:14):**  into this new era where fossil fuel economies are becoming stranded, where there is this  
**[0:38:19-0:38:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:19):**  new scramble and taking Chantal's point that yes, you know, food has been at the centre  
**[0:38:24-0:38:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:24):**  of conflict, resource conflict, you know, since the dawn of time, but it seems to me  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:27):**  that there is a resurgence around food as a result of the ecological breakdown that  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:32):**  we're seeing around us. What I'm wondering is how we can, either as individuals or, you  
**[0:38:39-0:38:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:39):**  know, or as think tanks and NGOs, you know, within this conversation, what can we be doing  
**[0:38:46-0:38:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:46):**  to increase a sense of food sovereignty, the importance of food sovereignty, to help to  
**[0:38:52-0:38:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:52):**  decrease corporate and governmental power, so that universal access to good quality nutrition  
**[0:38:58-0:39:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:58):**  becomes a foundation of peace and stability rather than something, which it is at the  
**[0:39:03-0:39:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:03):**  moment, that can be controlled and weaponised?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:06):**  There's so much in that question there. And I'm just going to kind of quickly start out  
**[0:39:12-0:39:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:12):**  with a quick comment that, you know, the idea that we are a kind of, you know, predatory  
**[0:39:18-0:39:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:18):**  and aggressive species isn't entirely borne out by a more thoughtful reflection on our  
**[0:39:26-0:39:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:26):**  history. For tens and tens and tens of thousands of years, humans were able to collaborate,  
**[0:39:34-0:39:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:34):**  were able to work effectively together, were able to recognise that, you know, all of our  
**[0:39:39-0:39:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:39):**  interests and our concerns are deeply, deeply interconnected and independent. So the story  
**[0:39:47-0:39:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:47):**  that we've now told ourselves that we are, you know, we're aggressive and we're predatory  
**[0:39:53-0:40:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:53):**  and it's a dog eat dog world and that's inevitable, it's an inevitable part of the human condition,  
**[0:40:00-0:40:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:00):**  I think really does need to be challenged. It does need to be confronted. That kind of  
**[0:40:04-0:40:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:04):**  argument serves particular purposes. And so in a kind of odd way, I think one of the things  
**[0:40:11-0:40:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:11):**  that we can be doing really effectively right now is changing the stories that we tell ourselves.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:16):**  About what is important to us as a species and how we can find ways of working together  
**[0:40:23-0:40:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:23):**  much more collaboratively and much more thoughtfully for everybody's interests. So instead of us  
**[0:40:32-0:40:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:32):**  kind of, you know, going along with this notion that, you know, unless we have really strong  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:42):**  mediating mechanisms, we'll just always be trying to grab what we can for ourselves.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:47):**  We just ask ourselves some different questions, we tell ourselves some different stories about  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:51):**  what's possible. So I think in very practical terms, I think that means working much more  
**[0:40:55-0:41:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:55):**  directly with citizens and citizens in communities and certainly just very quickly, the work  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:00):**  we've done at FFCC with 150 of the poorest communities in the UK with big local and local  
**[0:41:06-0:41:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:06):**  trust demonstrates that absolutely clearly to me that with the right conversations, the  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:12):**  right information, with the right data, people who are often experiencing great food insecurity  
**[0:41:17-0:41:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:17):**  themselves are horrified and furious that their poverty is being weaponized to shore  
**[0:41:23-0:41:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:23):**  up a particular version of the food system and want to see governments and business working  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:29):**  together much more effectively to create a much fairer, much more sustainable and much  
**[0:41:34-0:41:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:34):**  more balanced food system that meets everybody's needs and looks after our planet.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:41):**  Jason Vale That's great. And also just to mention to  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:43):**  people that in terms of an introduction to the Big Local Project, there is a Farmgate  
**[0:41:48-0:41:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:48):**  podcast, I'll give you the link for that, you know, in due course that we did with the  
**[0:41:52-0:41:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:52):**  Food Farming and Countryside Commission outlining the Big Local Project and its importance.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:57):**  It's a really good project. Juno, just finally coming back to you before we go to our audience.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:03):**  There have been many food crises over our lifetimes. And, you know, we've talked about  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:08):**  three in the course of the last 15 years. This is just the latest. But from what you've  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:12):**  seen and from the conversations that you've had, from the conversations you've been involved  
**[0:42:18-0:42:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:18):**  in with the World Food Programme and other agencies, do you feel hopeful that something  
**[0:42:23-0:42:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:23):**  will change for the better as a result of this food crisis?  
**[0:42:27-0:42:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:27):**  Guillermo De Soto Yeah, absolutely. And I would maybe mention  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:31):**  that that's a result of two crises. It's the food crisis and the climate crisis. And it  
**[0:42:36-0:42:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:36):**  is eventually it's just two sides of this coin of the same crisis, which is that we're  
**[0:42:43-0:42:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:43):**  living beyond the boundaries of this of this planet. There's a pretty ecological economies  
**[0:42:49-0:42:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:49):**  here say that poverty will be only made history if nature enters economic calculations the  
**[0:42:55-0:43:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:55):**  same way we calculate buildings and infrastructure. So I think that's what's happening in the  
**[0:43:01-0:43:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:01):**  air and development community. Instead of used to have these isolated interventions  
**[0:43:06-0:43:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:06):**  of water and mitigating conflict and improving food security and not really having an integrated  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:13):**  strategy on what's going on on the ground. Why are we having why are we seeing more and  
**[0:43:18-0:43:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:18):**  more conflict and worsening food security situation. And I feel because of these other  
**[0:43:25-0:43:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:25):**  people are coming to realise that a lot of the humanitarian disasters that are happening  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:31):**  caused by environmental degradation, then it's quite clear that if you really want to  
**[0:43:37-0:43:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:37):**  change something over long term, we need to take nature into account. So for instance,  
**[0:43:43-0:43:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:43):**  what we're doing with the WFP, WFP traditionally used to be food, namely, you know, those purchase  
**[0:43:51-0:43:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:51):**  from other countries and then disappeared into these poor countries. What we now looking  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:56):**  at the WFP is that how can we improve the food security and build stability in the in  
**[0:44:02-0:44:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:02):**  the community level by restoring landscapes. So we kind of going back into the sustainable  
**[0:44:11-0:44:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:11):**  governance of natural resources and then restoring ecosystems. And there we would be actually  
**[0:44:17-0:44:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:17):**  addressing way more problems than just food security. Actually, land use it's it constitutes  
**[0:44:26-0:44:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:26):**  30% of the world's carbon footprint. When would we we estimate that the cost of the  
**[0:44:34-0:44:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:34):**  renewable energy we go down. So the land use probably be even bigger share of the carbon  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:38):**  footprint and it should not be this is one of the few sectors which actually could be  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:43):**  a carbon sink. So all that is kind of coming together. What we are seeing in our work is  
**[0:44:49-0:44:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:49):**  that we do believe that over time there will be price for carbon. This price will affect  
**[0:44:56-0:45:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:56):**  that occur as you mentioned that will curve a demand on very high carbon products. However,  
**[0:45:04-0:45:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:04):**  that will also create a massive financial vehicle for landscape restoration in these  
**[0:45:08-0:45:13](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:08):**  countries where we work. It is already there. It's just pulling these things together. We  
**[0:45:13-0:45:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:13):**  believe that over time climate finance will really be a very important vehicle for financing  
**[0:45:18-0:45:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:18):**  sustainable development in these countries. And it's trying to make sure of course that  
**[0:45:23-0:45:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:23):**  the carbon financing in and of itself doesn't create distortions around other forms of natural  
**[0:45:29-0:45:35](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:29):**  capital and degradation of biodiversity in one way or another. And I think that the work  
**[0:45:35-0:45:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:35):**  that you're doing in particular, Juna, you know, with the way that you're channeling  
**[0:45:39-0:45:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:39):**  that finance in order that you can do broader natural capital restoration, the delivery  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:46):**  of agroecology and regenerative farm management in the Sahel is extremely interesting. And  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:52):**  thank you for that. Look, thanks so much to all three of you for those fantastic contributions.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:57):**  I think we should go to our audience. We only have another sort of 12 or 13 minutes before  
**[0:46:01-0:46:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:01):**  we need to draw to a close. I've got a question here from Nicky, which is, and I'm not sure  
**[0:46:06-0:46:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:06):**  whether to send this to Chantal or Sue, so perhaps you can kind of wave a hand when you  
**[0:46:11-0:46:18](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:11):**  decide. How do we address the market dependency for outputs as opposed to just inputs, for  
**[0:46:18-0:46:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:18):**  example, synthetic fertilizers? Many farmers identified the development of markets for  
**[0:46:23-0:46:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:23):**  their agroecologically produced products as being too slow to meet their demands to shift  
**[0:46:28-0:46:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:28):**  farm businesses into shorter supply chains. So how do we address the market dependency  
**[0:46:34-0:46:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:34):**  for outputs? Who wants to have a go? Sue?  
**[0:46:38-0:46:48](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:38):**  So I think there are auspicious lines emerging in the government's, albeit very weak response  
**[0:46:48-0:46:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:48):**  to the national food strategy. It talks about strengthening public procurement and local  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:55):**  supply chains. And so working with local governments and anchor institutions at a local scale over  
**[0:47:03-0:47:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:03):**  a period, I think can be really, can be really fruitful. So one of the conversations that  
**[0:47:08-0:47:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:08):**  we had in Wales as part of our own public procurement research policy was encouraging  
**[0:47:15-0:47:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:15):**  those anchor institutions to enter into conversations with collaborative farmers or collective co-ops  
**[0:47:23-0:47:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:23):**  of farmers and to shift contracts over, we said at the time, a seven year period. So  
**[0:47:31-0:47:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:31):**  that first of all, farmers and cooperatives can gear up collectively to provide the quantity  
**[0:47:38-0:47:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:38):**  of outputs that are needed, but also that the buyers can first of all, divest themselves  
**[0:47:45-0:47:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:45):**  of their existing contracts with their standard suppliers, but also be more reassured that  
**[0:47:53-0:48:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:53):**  the new arrangements would stand up to the particular demands of a big public procurement  
**[0:48:00-0:48:07](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:00):**  initiative. So I think there are glimmers, there are glimmers of possibility starting  
**[0:48:07-0:48:12](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:07):**  to show up in places around the UK. Thanks very much Sue. June, probably this  
**[0:48:12-0:48:17](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:12):**  is one for you, which is how do you see the role of precision breeding in countering ongoing  
**[0:48:17-0:48:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:17):**  issues in global food supply chains? And I guess as well as precision breeding, perhaps  
**[0:48:23-0:48:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:23):**  you should think about that more broadly in terms of the role of technology.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:33](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:27):**  Yeah, to be honest, I haven't been working that much on precision breeding. Yeah, I mean,  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:33):**  we definitely see here there's a couple of UN agencies which are developing a more drought  
**[0:48:39-0:48:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:39):**  and higher temperature resistant varieties, which I say it's only needed. But yeah, to  
**[0:48:46-0:48:49](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:46):**  be honest, I haven't been working very much on that myself.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:49):**  Yeah, I think it's a tough question maybe that I'm going to dance around, but when we  
**[0:48:53-0:48:58](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:53):**  look at precision breeding, it may offer some benefits, I think in terms of short term resilience,  
**[0:48:58-0:49:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:58):**  perhaps less input in energy use, maintaining yields, things like that. But again, from  
**[0:49:03-0:49:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:03):**  our perspective, we have to look at the context in which these technologies are being developed.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:08):**  Does precision breeding mean it's going to be the same handful of companies guiding the  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:11):**  direction of our food systems? Does this kind of innovation mean it's going to keep taking  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:16):**  public funds away from diversification from protecting biodiversity? Does it mean maintaining  
**[0:49:22-0:49:26](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:22):**  monoculture crop systems, huge industrial livestock systems, which, again, ultimately  
**[0:49:26-0:49:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:26):**  aren't so natural and aren't able to provide sustainable livelihoods for farmers? Maybe  
**[0:49:32-0:49:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:32):**  one thing is that with some colleagues, we recently looked at the uptake of any innovation  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:37):**  to be considered against the 13 principles of agroecology that were outlined by the FAO.  
**[0:49:42-0:49:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:42):**  Just to maybe use that as a benchmark to look at when we're thinking about adopting a technology,  
**[0:49:47-0:49:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:47):**  is it really delivering on all the co-benefits that agroecology proposes, beyond productivity?  
**[0:49:53-0:49:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:53):**  Is it working on environmental grounds, socio-economic grounds, cultural grounds? And I think when  
**[0:49:57-0:50:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:57):**  we look at it from this broader framing, it really helps us assess whether a technology  
**[0:50:01-0:50:06](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:01):**  is helpful or not for the long term. This next question is quite UK centric, but  
**[0:50:06-0:50:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:06):**  I think we could sort of take it in terms of the UK, but also in terms of the European  
**[0:50:10-0:50:16](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:10):**  Union and the way that farm to fork strategy might work. And the question is, by what mechanisms,  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:16):**  and most importantly, in terms of the question for me, on what timescale could the desired  
**[0:50:21-0:50:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:21):**  level of taxation that Sue talks about be delivered? What's the ideal transition time,  
**[0:50:28-0:50:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:28):**  I guess, from where we are now to where we need to be if those finances were to be shifted?  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:34):**  Well, 2030 is a critical point in time, isn't it? But that's not, you know, waiting until  
**[0:50:39-0:50:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:39):**  2030 to try and get everything done in the last year or 18 months or so. It is starting  
**[0:50:45-0:50:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:45):**  to put mechanisms in place right now so that by 2030, we've created more promising conditions  
**[0:50:52-0:51:00](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:52):**  to be able to tackle these huge issues that we're describing here. I mean, I don't really  
**[0:51:00-0:51:08](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:00):**  want to give a glib answer. It's too easy to do that. We haven't got much time. But  
**[0:51:08-0:51:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:08):**  what is clearly needed is much more energy invested in shareholder action and ensuring  
**[0:51:19-0:51:28](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:19):**  that shareholders are able to consider a whole raft of considerations, not just shareholder  
**[0:51:28-0:51:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:28):**  value, super national actions where the European Union had been doing some really good work  
**[0:51:34-0:51:42](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:34):**  on this to make sources of funds and locations of funds much more transparent, much less  
**[0:51:42-0:51:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:42):**  opaque is another step in that direction. And I think perhaps the third thing relates  
**[0:51:50-0:51:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:50):**  again to working directly with citizens, doing everything we can to work directly with citizens  
**[0:51:57-0:52:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:57):**  so that we reveal for citizens much more of what is fundamentally a very opaque food system  
**[0:52:03-0:52:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:03):**  where the kind of risks are taken by citizens and primary producers very often, but all  
**[0:52:10-0:52:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:10):**  of the rewards are being sucked up by this sort of invisible middles and global multinationals,  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:19):**  but often speculators, people who are speculating on the financialisation of food. So bringing  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:25):**  much more transparency to citizens in the global north about what's really going on  
**[0:52:31-0:52:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:31):**  and inviting them to not just change their purchasing habits in a supermarket, but change  
**[0:52:38-0:52:43](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:38):**  how they vote, how they vote for governments who are prepared to tackle those big structural  
**[0:52:43-0:52:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:43):**  issues. This is probably the final question that we'll  
**[0:52:47-0:52:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:47):**  deal with today. And I think it might be one that it's worth each of you having a bit  
**[0:52:52-0:52:59](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:52):**  of a go at and just summarising any points that you have for the end. And the question  
**[0:52:59-0:53:04](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:59):**  is, can panellists comment on how looking at the climate ecosystem food breakdown issue  
**[0:53:04-0:53:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:04):**  through the lens of water and the hydrological cycle as opposed to carbon only would change  
**[0:53:10-0:53:14](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:10):**  our emphasis on these solutions? I can comment from this. So what I'm doing  
**[0:53:14-0:53:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:14):**  and what I'm researching is the sustainable management of semi-arid arid lands. So obviously  
**[0:53:19-0:53:27](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:19):**  water is a big limiting factor there. I think how it changes the climate action is that  
**[0:53:27-0:53:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:27):**  it's actually the start that we realise that there's a water crisis, that it's actually  
**[0:53:32-0:53:38](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:32):**  the extra addition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It's just the tip of an iceberg.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:45](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:38):**  We have a way bigger problem down there. It's a collapse of biodiversity. We are losing  
**[0:53:45-0:53:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:45):**  here in Sahel, for instance, we have massive areas of land. We're completely wiping off  
**[0:53:50-0:53:55](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:50):**  biomass on top of that land. We're wiping off the rooting system. We're wiping off the  
**[0:53:55-0:54:03](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:55):**  soil organic carbon. So that means when it rains, the water doesn't stay in that landscape.  
**[0:54:03-0:54:11](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:03):**  So they're completely combined, the climate crisis and the water crisis. And then again,  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:11):**  for instance, I work with climate action. There are a lot of people getting an engineering  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:15):**  approach on climate crisis saying, let's just build a machine which will suck down  
**[0:54:19-0:54:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:19):**  carbon from the atmosphere. And then there's more, let's say more system thinking people  
**[0:54:25-0:54:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:25):**  saying, no, that's probably not going to solve the problem that we have. The extra carbon  
**[0:54:31-0:54:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:31):**  in the atmosphere, it's just an indication that we are tipping off the planet of its  
**[0:54:37-0:54:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:37):**  balance of the biodegradable cycles. I think that taking water into account, it will maybe  
**[0:54:44-0:54:52](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:44):**  channel more attention towards landscape and nature. And I think that's the right way to  
**[0:54:52-0:54:53](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:52):**  go.  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:53):**  Yeah, I think I think Juna said it all. We're mostly systems people here in this virtual  
**[0:54:56-0:55:01](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:56):**  room, not silver bullet solutions people. So I don't think a single metric is ever the  
**[0:55:01-0:55:05](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:01):**  solution, whether it's carbon, methane, perhaps water. And again, coming from a policy perspective,  
**[0:55:05-0:55:10](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:05):**  I think there's no reason we should be having these conversations separately. We have different  
**[0:55:10-0:55:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:10):**  UN institutions or UN forums dealing with biodiversity, with climate, with desertification,  
**[0:55:15-0:55:19](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:15):**  with soils. These are all part of the same problem. So we know these things are interlinked  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:19):**  and making that effort from the local to the global level to connect these issues is how  
**[0:55:24-0:55:25](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:24):**  we get to somewhere more sustainable.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:25):**  Absolutely. And it was a point that Christiana Figueres, who was championing the Paris Agreement,  
**[0:55:31-0:55:34](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:31):**  made in one of the podcasts that we did again with the Food Farming and Countryside Commission,  
**[0:55:34-0:55:39](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:34):**  wasn't it, Sue? That one of the biggest mistakes the UN had made was separating out these processes,  
**[0:55:39-0:55:44](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:39):**  these environmental processes 30 years ago, when actually the effort now needs to be to  
**[0:55:44-0:55:47](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:44):**  reintegrate them. Sue, any final thoughts from you?  
**[0:55:47-0:55:51](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:47):**  Just absolutely agreeing with everything everybody's saying, including in the chat, and perhaps  
**[0:55:51-0:55:57](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:51):**  just strengthening my current obsession, which is finding ways of engaging citizens in some  
**[0:55:57-0:56:02](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:57):**  of these big and complex issues, because I know that they are interested. People do care  
**[0:56:02-0:56:09](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:02):**  about these things, and finding the ways to talk about these complex interconnected issues,  
**[0:56:09-0:56:15](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:09):**  and through my experience, through the lens of food, because we all eat food, can be very  
**[0:56:15-0:56:23](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:15):**  powerful, very engaging, very involving, and can motivate citizens to work then not just  
**[0:56:23-0:56:29](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:23):**  on food and food issues, but also on all of the other interconnected resilience building  
**[0:56:29-0:56:32](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:29):**  issues that we know we're going to need a lot more of in the future.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:37](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:32):**  Thank you. That's all we've got time for. I think that's been a fascinating hour. If  
**[0:56:37-0:56:41](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:37):**  you haven't yet had the chance to read the Food and Global Security Network's report,  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:41):**  Soil Health, a Security Threat Profile, may I urge you to do so. There are chapters in  
**[0:56:46-0:56:50](https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:46):**  there from one or two people in the audience, as well as from at least two of the panel

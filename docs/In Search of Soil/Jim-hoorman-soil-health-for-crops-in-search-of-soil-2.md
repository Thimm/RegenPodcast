### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 21 Oct 2020 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Whenever you hear somebody talk about no-till, you always hear it talked about in a positive  
**[0:00:25-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  light.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  Why is that?  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  What is no-till preventing?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  Or maybe a better way of asking that is, what problems do tillage cause to the soil structure?  
**[0:00:37-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  And if you are farming on land that has suffered from tillage, either self-imposed or a previous  
**[0:00:42-0:00:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:42):**  owner imposed, how do you solve the problems that tillage created?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:47):**  How do you use nature to undo the work that we did?  
**[0:00:51-0:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:51):**  Well, today to answer that question and much more, I'm talking to farm educator and former  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  Extension agent, Jim Horman.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  A lot of poor soil structure is due to excess tillage.  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  The tillage is causing that when you go down and you dig in the soil and you go down two  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:08):**  inches, I can tell you that probably some type of vertical tillage, anywhere from two  
**[0:01:14-0:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  to four inches, they'll go down and you can find those layers in the soil.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:19):**  Jim is somebody who has been involved in agriculture for his whole life, from working on farms  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:23):**  as a child, to managing farms throughout his career, to studying environmental science  
**[0:01:28-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:28):**  at the PhD level at The Ohio State University, where he also was a University Extension agent,  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  an educator in the Ohio area.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:38):**  Over the course of his career, he's focused a lot on grazing, water quality, no-till and  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  cover crops, and today we're going to talk a lot about no-till and cover crops.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  You can learn more about Jim's work at HormanSoilHealth.com, which I've linked to below, and while a lot  
**[0:01:55-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:55):**  of Jim's experience is on large acreage, the subject matter is something that easily scales  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  down.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:01):**  So whether you're on 10,000 acres, 1,000 acres, or half an acre, the principles are still  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  the same.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:08):**  Keep the soil covered, minimize soil disturbance, and keep a living root in the soil as much  
**[0:02:14-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  as possible.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  But now let's jump right into it with the great Jim Horman.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:20):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:23):**  Jim, when you look at soil, at the very basics, for people that might not understand soil  
**[0:02:30-0:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:30):**  and they might think it's, hey, this is just a inert thing in the ground that I grow plants  
**[0:02:35-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:35):**  in, how do you describe soil to farmers?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:40):**  I would have to say that soil is a living organism.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  When you look at the composition of soil, it's 45% mineral, and it should be about 50%  
**[0:02:51-0:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:51):**  pore space.  
**[0:02:52-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:52):**  But the most important part of that soil, what really makes soil what it is, is that  
**[0:02:57-0:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  other 4-5%, 3-4-5%.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:59):**  A lot of our soils are now down to 2% organic matter.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  But the organic matter to me is like the head and the brain and the heart.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  It controls so many things in the soil.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:10):**  I can remember I was interviewed about Martian soils, and I said, that's really not soil  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  because it doesn't have organic matter.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:19):**  It doesn't have the living organisms in it.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:23):**  That's what makes soil.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:24):**  Otherwise soil is really just ground up rock.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:27):**  And if you look at sand, silt, and clay, the only difference between those three is the  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  size of the particles.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:34):**  Sand will break down into silt.  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:36):**  Silt breaks down into clay, and that's just ground up rock.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  It doesn't become soil until you add the biology.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:44):**  I know from looking at a lot of the work that you've done, you've talked a lot of compaction  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  in the past.  
**[0:03:49-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:49):**  Let's focus on that.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  We'll circle back to organic matter a little bit down the line.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  For pore space and compaction, how big of a problem is that when it comes to soils?  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  You've seen a lot of ag soils throughout the Midwest.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  When you look at them, can you talk about a compacted soil and how that maybe performs  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:08):**  differently than a soil that's looser and friable?  
**[0:04:12-0:04:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  So it all goes back to that carbon.  
**[0:04:16-0:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  When you till a soil, that's really what creates the compaction.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:22):**  I really get upset, or I upset a lot of engineers because they will tell you that soil compaction  
**[0:04:29-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:29):**  is due to wheel traffic.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:31):**  But it would be interesting to do an experiment.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  We could take 100 people and put them across the field and put them a foot apart and have  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:38):**  them dig in the soil, and every one of them will find a compacted layer there.  
**[0:04:43-0:04:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:43):**  Now, are you telling me that tires went evenly across that whole field?  
**[0:04:48-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:48):**  No, that is where the tillage tool went.  
**[0:04:51-0:04:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  It's smoothing.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:52):**  What happens is it smooths that soil when it's wet, and that's causing the compaction.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:57):**  Basically, if you take two clay particles, they have a negative charge, you put a positive  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  atom in between there, it's going to set up like concrete.  
**[0:05:07-0:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:07):**  And that's what's happening in our soil.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:09):**  We're losing the organic matter with the tillage.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  And what we call soil compaction is really just poor soil structure.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  That's really what most soil...  
**[0:05:18-0:05:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:18):**  Now, does that mean that if I have heavy equipment and I go across the field, yes, I can cause  
**[0:05:24-0:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:24):**  soil compaction.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:25):**  But rain can cause soil compaction.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  If you plow a field and that soil will start to settle, you'll lose pore space as it rains.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:38):**  And the rain is coming down sometimes 30 miles per hour, it can actually compact you.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  So rain and gravity are also maybe not as much of an extent.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:48):**  The heavy equipment is major.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  But really what soil compaction is due to, or poor soil structure, is due to a lack of  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  living roots, it's due to a lack of biology in our soils.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:00):**  Our soils, we've lost anywhere from 50, 60, as much as 80% of our organic matter from  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:06):**  our soils.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  And when you do that, what happens is they shrink.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:11):**  I do this quite regularly.  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:13):**  I mean, anybody can do this.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:15):**  Just go out to a fence row and look at the fence row.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:20):**  And you will see anywhere from a six to nine inch elevation difference where you have undisturbed  
**[0:06:26-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  soils.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  And the difference between that and say your end row.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  Now on the end rows, it tends to be a little more compacted.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  But the difference there is due to the tillage, we've taken all that organic matter, put it  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  up into the atmosphere, and what has happened is our soils have shrunk.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  And that's that lack of pore space.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  Now all we have left is mainly the middle portion of the soil and it's cemented together  
**[0:06:51-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:51):**  by those negative and positive charges, and it becomes very dense.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  The way you can break that up, you can do it with tillage, but unfortunately, you're  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:00):**  just making it worse.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  But a root will do the same thing.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  It'll push the soil down, it pushes out, and it physically lifts that soil, expands it  
**[0:07:09-0:07:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:09):**  like an accordion.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:11):**  And then when that root decomposes, now you get the pore space.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  And that's how you start to expand your soil is by adding roots, and you start to add that  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  organic matter, and that's what makes good soil is the organic matter.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  Then we start, instead of forming micro aggregates, those are the real fine tiny pieces of soil  
**[0:07:34-0:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:34):**  that are covered.  
**[0:07:36-0:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:36):**  Now we're going to start to form what we call macro aggregates.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:41):**  Those are the little pieces of organic matter and roots and clay and silks and sand particles,  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:47):**  kind of all glued together with the root accidents and the microbial poop, and that will allow  
**[0:07:53-0:07:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  the air and the water and the gas exchange, and that will start to expand our soil.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:57):**  And that's when you see the soil crumble, that's when you know you have good soil structure,  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:03):**  okay?  
**[0:08:04-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:04):**  And that's what we're trying to do.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  When you look at compaction, you have organic matter being depleted, and then you also have  
**[0:08:11-0:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:11):**  the actual tilth of the structure of the soil being changed by, say, tillage.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:17):**  Is there a bigger cause of compaction in there?  
**[0:08:20-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:20):**  Is it the tilling which breaks up that natural supportive pore space and loosens it up so  
**[0:08:25-0:08:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  then when rain comes it wants to make it settle?  
**[0:08:27-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:27):**  Or is it the fact that you're now oxygenating that soil, bringing the organic matter up,  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  it's volatilizing off, it's burning off, it's being consumed by the microbes in the soil,  
**[0:08:37-0:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  and then you get both?  
**[0:08:38-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:38):**  So is there one side that is more problematic?  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:41):**  I'd say it's just a combination of both.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:43):**  It's that whole process.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:45):**  When you oxygenize a soil, the microbes go nuts, and they eat up.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  The most important part, what's lacking in most of our conventional soils, is the active  
**[0:08:57-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:57):**  organic matter.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  So the active organic matter is your root accidents, your sugars, your polysaccharides  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  in the soil that give us good soil structure.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:07):**  And when you oxygenize it and you turn it over or you really fluff it up like that,  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  what happens is you put a whole bunch of oxygen in there and the microbes go nuts, and then  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:18):**  the microbes start to consume all that active carbon, and then pretty soon what will happen  
**[0:09:25-0:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:25):**  is you lose all your structure, micro-aggregates, not as many macro-aggregates, and pretty soon  
**[0:09:33-0:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:33):**  your soil starts to shrink.  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:36):**  And then the other problem that happens is when you take that tillage tool across that,  
**[0:09:41-0:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  now what you're doing is you're taking all those micro-aggregates and you're cementing  
**[0:09:46-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:46):**  them together.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  Because I can go out in any field, I just did this the other day for another video,  
**[0:09:53-0:09:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:53):**  and we went out there and we dug in a soil that had been no-till since 1992, quote no-till.  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:59):**  Only it really wasn't no-till.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:00):**  The guy told me that he'd done some turbo-till, and I could tell you the exact depth that  
**[0:10:05-0:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  he turbo-tilled it, and he told me what years he did it.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:08):**  You know, it was a couple of years apart, but we could find those levels in the soil  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:12):**  and that soil broke apart on an even plane, straight across, right to the depth that he  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:17):**  turbo-tilled that soil.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  And we could see that in the soil.  
**[0:10:21-0:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:21):**  And then we went to another conventional field, and that field was like a solid chunk of concrete.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:28):**  They had done so much tillage that the soil was just really hard, really dense.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  Of course, it was dry out, and it's always going to look worse when it's dry, but you  
**[0:10:39-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:39):**  could get in that soil and it was just solid, had no structure to it whatsoever.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  So the more seeds you do, the more oxygen you put in, and then you're going to start  
**[0:10:51-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:51):**  getting these levels.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  I can still find the plow pan from 50, 60 years ago, even though guys haven't plowed  
**[0:10:59-0:11:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:59):**  for 50, 60 years.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:00):**  We can find that level still in the soil.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:02):**  It's still there if you're doing conventional tillage.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:05):**  Now, if you start doing no-till, cover crops, start growing a lot of wheat and things like  
**[0:11:11-0:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  that, it's a little harder to find because they're breaking that up.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:14):**  The more roots you get in there, it takes a little time, but they'll break those levels  
**[0:11:18-0:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  up and they can get down there.  
**[0:11:20-0:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:20):**  The biggest thing I can remember, a quick story, is we went to Minnesota, oh, probably  
**[0:11:26-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  10 years ago.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  Most beautiful soil I've ever seen, the soil was the color of your shirt, just pure black.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:33):**  I said, oh, this is such beautiful-looking soil.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:37):**  We dug in the soil and we could find a compacted layer.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:41):**  Their biggest complaint was, I said, boy, you guys must get pretty good yields here.  
**[0:11:44-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:44):**  Well, it really varies.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  He said, depends on how much rain we get during the summer.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  And yet there was a field right next to it, they had a dry summer and the corn didn't  
**[0:11:54-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:54):**  look very good.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  125, 150 bushel corn, okay?  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:57):**  Should raise 250, easy.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:00):**  Right next to it was this beautiful no-till field and had the same amount of moisture.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:04):**  Well, we went over there, no compaction, the roots were getting real deep.  
**[0:12:08-0:12:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:08):**  So we dug a hole where the conventional soil was.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:11):**  Guess what?  
**[0:12:13-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:13):**  They plow their soils every single year, whether it's corn or soybeans, compacted layer there.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  The roots could not get to the moisture six inches below where the roots were.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:23):**  There was more soil there, but they couldn't reach it because of that compacted area.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  So compaction is a major problem.  
**[0:12:30-0:12:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:30):**  It can last for multiple years.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:33):**  We have seen in research studies where we compacted the soil, it can last easily nine  
**[0:12:39-0:12:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:39):**  to ten years if you don't do something to remediate that.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:43):**  The best way to remediate it, it's slower, but it's used roots.  
**[0:12:47-0:12:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  Roots is what's going to heal our soils, but that can take two to three years to break  
**[0:12:52-0:12:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:52):**  up those compacted layers.  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:53):**  So from a single tillage, you can see that plow pan last nine to ten years?  
**[0:12:59-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  Wow.  
**[0:13:01-0:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  A single tillage, but in our research studies, what we did is we took zero, ten, and twenty-ton  
**[0:13:10-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:10):**  loads.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  This was started way back in the 70s, and so they used the same methodology.  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:16):**  We had no-till fields, and then we had conventional fields.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:21):**  I can tell you that conventional fields had poor soil structure and more compaction than  
**[0:13:27-0:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:27):**  the no-till fields.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:29):**  And what I'd really like to do now is do no-till with a cover crop, but these were set up 50  
**[0:13:35-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:35):**  years ago.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  They're not going to change them very quickly.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:37):**  These are ongoing, long-term research studies that are being done by Ohio State.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  But all I'm telling you is that it's a combination of tillage.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:45):**  The wheel compaction is a big issue, especially on some of our big farms now.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:51):**  We have grain carts that can hold two semi-loads worth of grain.  
**[0:13:56-0:14:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:56):**  Why you would want to put that much grain on that many axle loads going across your  
**[0:14:00-0:14:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:00):**  field makes no sense to me whatsoever.  
**[0:14:02-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:02):**  But on really big fields, yes, we're going to get wheel traffic.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  But a lot of poor soil structure is due to excess tillage.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  The tillage is causing that when you go down and you dig in the soil and you go down two  
**[0:14:16-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  inches, I can tell you that probably some type of vertical tillage, anywhere from two  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  to four inches, they'll go down and you can find those layers in the soil.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:28):**  You can find where the tip of that tillage tool went because there's almost like a perfect  
**[0:14:33-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:33):**  break in the soil, especially when it's dry right now.  
**[0:14:35-0:14:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:35):**  You might not see it as much when it's wet, but when it's dry right now, you can dig in  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  the soil.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:41):**  You can see exactly where you tilled either last year or the last couple of years.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:46):**  It'll break perfectly on an even plane across that whole field.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  I can dig almost anywhere in that field and I can find that same level.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:55):**  So, again, tillage is a major, major part of the problem that we're having with poor  
**[0:15:00-0:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:00):**  soil structure, what we call soil compaction.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:02):**  One of the big principles of soil conservation is minimize soil disturbance.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:08):**  So when it comes to no-till, or quote no-till, are there degrees of tillage that you think  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  are more harmful than others?  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  There's a lot of proponents of vertical tillage, at least maybe in the conversion process of  
**[0:15:24-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:24):**  going from conventional to no-till.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  And then you have going back to a moldboard plow, which is going to do complete inversion  
**[0:15:31-0:15:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:31):**  to on a smaller scale, we see a lot of people using tillers, which are doing inversion.  
**[0:15:37-0:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:37):**  How do you view tillage on a curve of severe to extreme and are they going to lead to the  
**[0:15:44-0:15:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:44):**  same types of results?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:45):**  Oh, yes.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:47):**  Tillage is going to be harmful, but if I was to start with the one that I would give you  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  the best results would probably be your strip till.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:57):**  Because what you can do is you can take maybe a couple inch zone that you're going to till,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  that will dry that soil out.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:05):**  Every time you do tillage, you dry the soil out a half inch to an inch.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:09):**  Okay?  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:10):**  And that's a zone where you can get good seed to soil contact, you can get your corn, your  
**[0:16:14-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:14):**  beans or whatever you're trying to grow, if we're talking more row crops, corn and beans  
**[0:16:20-0:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  would be the big ones, but maybe cotton or something like that.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:24):**  But you could put it in that little zone, but then you've got a nice area on either  
**[0:16:28-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  side of it that's undisturbed and that area can heal and as those roots grow out, they're  
**[0:16:34-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:34):**  going to get into that undisturbed soil.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  So for me, kind of an area where guys kind of make the transition would be on strip till.  
**[0:16:43-0:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:43):**  I'm going to say all tillage is going to be bad, but strip till is probably one of those  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:49):**  ways that we can transition.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:51):**  And maybe at some point, you'll heal that soil enough that you say, it's almost like  
**[0:16:56-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:56):**  training wheels.  
**[0:16:57-0:16:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  Okay?  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:58):**  I need a crutch.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  My crutch is a strip till.  
**[0:17:01-0:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  I'm going to do that for maybe the first five, 10 years.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:04):**  Once I get the rest of the soil healed up and I get good water infiltration and I'm  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:09):**  getting good nutrient recycling, well, maybe I don't even need that crutch anymore.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:13):**  Maybe I don't need the training wheels.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:15):**  Maybe I can throw them away and go to full blown no-till.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  So I think that would be the optimal deal is to go to full blown no-till.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:23):**  But no-till by itself is only about 40% of the solution.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  You got to have the live roots in there, the extra roots from the cover crops.  
**[0:17:34-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  You got to have that soil covered with living roots year round.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  That's what's going to heal your soil.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:39):**  If you're just doing no-till by itself, it's going to take you a long, long time.  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  You're going to see those compacted layers in there for many, many years because you're  
**[0:17:48-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:48):**  only getting one set of roots.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  Whatever crop you're growing, and you might only grow that crop for maybe four months,  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:54):**  five months out of the year at most, you got to have live roots in there year round.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:59):**  That's just the way most of our soils develop.  
**[0:18:01-0:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  Live roots is what's going to heal your soils and make them better.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  And it's going to add that carbon back into the soil.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  Root turnover, that's why the prairie soils, 50% of those roots turned over every year.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  That's why out in the prairies, we have soil profiles that are 10, 15, 20, 30 feet deep  
**[0:18:22-0:18:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:22):**  with organic matter because half of those prairie roots turned over every year.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:26):**  The area that I live in, in Ohio, we had mainly forested areas.  
**[0:18:32-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32):**  And these tall oak trees would live 100, 200 years, and there was very little root turnover.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  So most of the organic matter came from the leaves and from the roots that turned over  
**[0:18:43-0:18:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  in the top six inches, but then our soils aren't very well developed because we didn't  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:48):**  have very much root turnover.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  As you go out west and you get into areas that don't have trees, those prairie plants,  
**[0:18:55-0:18:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  the roots are turning over 50%.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:57):**  And some of those roots go down 5, 10, 15 feet deep in the soil, and that's how they  
**[0:19:03-0:19:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:03):**  get those really high levels of organic matter on those what we call mollisols soils, is  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:09):**  what they are.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:10):**  And those are some of the most productive soils in the world, okay, is the mollisols.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:15):**  And what's interesting is you can change your soil to make it act like a mollisol, and if  
**[0:19:22-0:19:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:22):**  you want to do that, you have to have a large turnover, raise as many crops as you can,  
**[0:19:28-0:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:28):**  and have a large turnover of roots, and then you'll transition your soil to becoming more  
**[0:19:33-0:19:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:33):**  and more like a mollisols soil.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:36):**  Soils are not static.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:37):**  They're changing all the time.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:40):**  And you can either do management that makes them better, or what we've done in the last

**[0:20:30-0:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  Corn is actually quite a bit better than soybeans.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:34):**  Soybeans are the worst.

**[0:20:47-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:47):**  They don't add a lot of organic matter.  
**[0:20:49-0:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  You can harvest a field of soybeans, and if you look at the residue on the above ground,  
**[0:20:56-0:21:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:56):**  and really what we're worried about, mainly concerned about, is the residue below ground.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:00):**  We need some residue on the surface to armor it, but once you get above ground, you generally

**[0:21:10-0:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:10):**  We're burning more organic matter than we're gaining.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:14):**  So what happens over time is your soils get harder and denser when you grow a lot of soybeans.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  If you really want to add organic matter to your soils, if you were to go continuous corn,

**[0:21:31-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:31):**  corn.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  What we see is when you look at the research, every year you grow corn, you add a little  
**[0:21:38-0:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  more organic matter because it has a big root, and they're not fine, but they're very big,  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:43):**  and that's part of the problem.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:45):**  Those big roots can't break up the soil as well as the fine roots, so you'll get more  
**[0:21:50-0:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:50):**  organic matter with corn than you will with soybeans, and you can actually build your  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:58):**  organic matter levels with corn.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:00):**  So if you have corn in the rotation more often, you'll see it.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  Now, maybe that's not good from a rotational aspect, but the way we can make up for that  
**[0:22:12-0:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:12):**  is if I'm going to grow soybeans, well then I need to put in another crop after the soybeans,  
**[0:22:17-0:22:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  something like cereal rye or winter oats or annual rye grass, something like that that  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:24):**  will add the roots, and we can get more root turnover, and if I could add maybe several  
**[0:22:29-0:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:29):**  things in a mixture, I want some shallow roots, I want some deep roots, I want some thick  
**[0:22:36-0:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:36):**  roots and thin roots, you want all different kinds of roots.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:40):**  The more diversity you get out there, the quicker you're going to be able to break up  
**[0:22:44-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:44):**  that compassion.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  Our biggest problem with corn is a lot of times the soybeans have compacted the soil  
**[0:22:51-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:51):**  so much that when the corn starts to grow, when it hits a compacted area, what happens?  
**[0:22:55-0:22:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  It goes off at a 90-degree angle.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:58):**  We call those J-roots.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  They go off at a 90-degree angle, and they have to wait until they can stretch out until  
**[0:23:07-0:23:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:07):**  they can find a crack in the soil, and then they'll go down that crack, and then they'll  
**[0:23:11-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:11):**  spread out.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  Well, that takes some time, and then that generally hurts your yields.  
**[0:23:17-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:17):**  It's a lot better if that corn can go straight down and just really spread out and not be  
**[0:23:22-0:23:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  restricted.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:23):**  If you get a great big ball of corn roots out there that are growing down four or five

**[0:23:33-0:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:33):**  matter to your soil.  
**[0:23:35-0:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:35):**  Eventually, what they'll do is most roots are following the same path almost every year.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:40):**  So when one crop's done, the next crop is going to look for the path of least resistance.  
**[0:23:46-0:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  You'll either find a crack, a root hair, or some of these bigger macro-aggregates or macro-pores,  
**[0:23:52-0:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:52):**  I'm sorry, macro-pores, and it'll follow those.  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:55):**  That's why earthworm holes are so beneficial, because the earthworm lines its hole with  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:01):**  a lot of nutrients that are readily available, and the roots will just jam-pack an earthworm

**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:14):**  the earthworms.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:15):**  Usually, if you have earthworms, that means you're on the path to good soil health.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:19):**  If you have a lot of earthworms and you're promoting earthworms and you start getting  
**[0:24:24-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:24):**  some, a little bit of residue, now these earthworms will take a lot of that residue deep into  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  the soil and kind of mix it in, and you've got to feed your livestock.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:35):**  So guys have had problems where they've had so many earthworms that they just pull all  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  the residue down, then they leave that top there.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  But those are things that we just have to work through, and that's where you put in  
**[0:24:47-0:24:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  a lot of different diversity of different cover crops.  
**[0:24:51-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:51):**  Some of the earthworms kind of like a certain residue a little bit better than others.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  If you get really big chunks, they can't pull it into the soil, and that will kind of armor  
**[0:25:00-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:00):**  your soil so that you won't have soil erosion.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  Okay?  
**[0:25:04-0:25:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:04):**  We want to keep that soil, have a lot of different residue there.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:08):**  Most of the residue in healthy soils is breaking down very quickly.  
**[0:25:11-0:25:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:11):**  We're getting a very high turnover.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:14):**  If you're in a soil, in a field, and your residue is not breaking down, chances are

**[0:25:57-0:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:57):**  Is it more like if I put my fist into the sand, when I pull my hand out of the sand,

**[0:26:59-0:27:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:59):**  Those are the glues and the sugars that are in the soil that causes soil to be sticky.  
**[0:27:08-0:27:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:08):**  What's happening in a macroaggregate is you're taking all the microaggregates, the root goes

**[0:27:19-0:27:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  soil particles, and it's actually compacting the soil.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:22):**  People didn't realize this, but roots actually compact the soil, but they do it with a purpose.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  So what they're doing is they're lining up these particles of soil, and then they're  
**[0:27:34-0:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  enveloping them with some of the root exudates, and they're forming what we call macroaggregates.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:43):**  And then the microbial waste.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:45):**  And then pretty soon what you get is this little pad that will crumble, and that's what  
**[0:27:49-0:27:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:49):**  we call good soil structure.  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:52):**  When you can go into soil and you look at it, those macroaggregates, the soil just crumbles  
**[0:27:58-0:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:58):**  on you.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:59):**  Those are macroaggregates.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:01):**  When you go into a soil that's been heavily tilled, and it's just one solid mass, that's  
**[0:28:07-0:28:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:07):**  really just a bunch of very, very small microaggregates that are all cemented together like bricks  
**[0:28:13-0:28:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:13):**  in a house, those are your microaggregates, the bricks would be, they're all cemented

**[0:28:22-0:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  it.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  So there's a lot of things going on.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  Throughout your soil, everything is a microenvironment.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  You can have just a couple millimeters away totally different soil conditions.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:38):**  One can be totally saturated just a little bit away.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  The pH can be at one level just a couple millimeters away.  
**[0:28:45-0:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  The pH can totally change and it can be aerated.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:49):**  And that's why we always talk about soil on a micro view.  
**[0:28:55-0:29:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:55):**  Everything is in a very, very, it changes so much within the soil.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:01):**  There really is no such thing as a uniform soil condition because it's so variable throughout  
**[0:29:06-0:29:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:06):**  the field.  
**[0:29:07-0:29:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:07):**  And we like to just combine everything together and take kind of an average, but there really  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:12):**  isn't a thing called averages in the soil.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  It's all over the board, even just within a very, very short distance.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:20):**  And that's actually very good and healthy to have different conditions because as the  
**[0:29:24-0:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:24):**  roots going out there, it can search out different minerals and different conditions and it makes  
**[0:29:31-0:29:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:31):**  the nutrients available.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:32):**  What's happening in most of our soils is our soils are becoming too compacted.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:38):**  We're getting away from that balance.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:40):**  And what's happening is we're getting oversaturated soils or soils that are just totally compacted  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:47):**  and then we don't have that balance.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:50):**  And we've gone too far one way or the other.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:53):**  Then your plants become sick and they just don't grow as well because they have nutrient  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:59):**  deficiencies.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:00):**  So what we're trying to do is in a healthy soil, you should have a balance of conditions  
**[0:30:05-0:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  and not any one condition should be prevalent throughout that soil.  
**[0:30:11-0:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:11):**  And that's actually good.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:13):**  You get more diversity when you have a balance.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:16):**  Does that make sense?  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  It does.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  It does make a lot of sense.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:19):**  So thinking of that and thinking back to this idea of corn hitting a compaction layer, J-rooting,  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:28):**  how can cover crops start to break up that compaction?  
**[0:30:31-0:30:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:31):**  If you have a plant in there that is hitting a compaction layer and J-rooting, what's changing  
**[0:30:37-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:37):**  when you introduce other plants?  
**[0:30:39-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  Why can they break up?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  You said corn has larger roots.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:41):**  Is it they have finer roots?  
**[0:30:42-0:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:42):**  Is it different and more microbiology happening?  
**[0:30:47-0:30:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:47):**  I always talk about the situation where, you know, carpenter, if you think about carpenters,  
**[0:30:54-0:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:54):**  if you ever do any carpentry work, if you got to drill a hole, you'll drill a pilot  
**[0:31:00-0:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:00):**  hole first.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:01):**  Okay.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  That makes it easier for the bigger drill bit to get through.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  So think of the corn as being a big drill bit.  
**[0:31:08-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:08):**  And when it hits a very dense area, it can't get through.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  But if you have a cover crop that has a lot of very fine root hairs, they can get in between  
**[0:31:18-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:18):**  some of these areas and start to break it up a little bit.  
**[0:31:22-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  And then when the next root comes along, it can follow that same path.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  And a lot of the nutrients are going to be there and better gas exchange.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  And it'll follow that same path.  
**[0:31:33-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  But it's just about like drilling a pilot hole.  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  It makes it a lot easier for that bigger root then to penetrate into that.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  And over time, it might take two to three years to break up your compaction in soil.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:45):**  Generally, we say cover crop roots can go down about a foot each year, but there's always  
**[0:31:51-0:31:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:51):**  going to be areas in a soil that are really, really compacted.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:54):**  And it may only, it might be more, it might be better to think instead of how many feet  
**[0:32:01-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  that they go down or inches, it might be better to think of it in percent.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  Maybe the first year they take out 10 or 20% of the compaction, the next year they take  
**[0:32:10-0:32:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:10):**  out another 20 to 30% of the compaction.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:13):**  And then by the maybe the third year, now we're up to 70, 80% of the total soil is less  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  compacted, and the roots can get through there.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  And then after, you know, four, five, six, seven years, that soil just literally crumbles  
**[0:32:28-0:32:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:28):**  and you can't find any compacted layers whatsoever.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  So it takes time.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:32):**  It's probably better to think of soil structure and soil compaction in percentages, how much  
**[0:32:38-0:32:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  compaction we can take out versus in depth.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:42):**  Because most of the time, the compaction, the poor soil structure is at certain levels  
**[0:32:47-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:47):**  in the soil, and we're trying to get through that.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:50):**  And maybe the first year we only take out 10% or 20%.  
**[0:32:54-0:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:54):**  It's hard to say.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:55):**  I've not done any studies on this.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  But just visualizing it and thinking about it as you add more roots, the next year, you're  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:03):**  going to start to spread out and you're going to start to break up more of that soil.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  And by the third, fourth, fifth year, you're just every year you're making that soil a  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:11):**  little bit better place and a little bit easier to get through.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:15):**  And pretty soon that soil starts to crumble.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:17):**  It smells better.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  You got more biological life.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:21):**  And then it's going to start to perform.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:24):**  Most of our problems in no-till start with soil compaction.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:29):**  Until you get your soil to be healthy, you got to get rid of the compaction.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:36):**  You've got to get good soil structure.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:37):**  And until that happens, you're going to struggle to make no-till.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:40):**  Corn, soybeans, whatever crop you're trying to raise, you're going to have a hard time  
**[0:33:44-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:44):**  making that successful to you, get better soil structure.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:47):**  And that may take a couple years, one, two, three, four, five years.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:52):**  Just depends on how bad it is.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  So do you typically see a yield drop where somebody's producing at a high level pre-no-till  
**[0:34:00-0:34:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:00):**  and then they go and start to transition no-till, maybe yield drops, their soil structure improves,  
**[0:34:04-0:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:04):**  and then it starts getting back up there and creeping back up?  
**[0:34:08-0:34:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  Yes.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:09):**  Yes.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:10):**  And there's a couple reasons for that.  
**[0:34:13-0:34:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:13):**  A lot of it has to do with nitrogen.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:16):**  So when you have poor soil structure, I always like to think of, let's think of any natural  
**[0:34:22-0:34:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:22):**  disaster.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:24):**  And really tillage is a natural disaster.  
**[0:34:27-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  So the one I always think about, and I'm a little older than most people, maybe Katrina,  
**[0:34:32-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  a lot of people can remember the big hurricane that happened down in New Orleans.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  Let me ask you a question.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:39):**  What was the worst day?  
**[0:34:40-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:40):**  Was it the worst day for the people that were down there, the actual day that the hurricane  
**[0:34:45-0:34:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:45):**  hit?  
**[0:34:46-0:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:46):**  Well, most people found shelter.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:48):**  But then what happened?  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:49):**  All of a sudden, the lights went out and the floodgates didn't work.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:54):**  And the area started to flood and people started to get away.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:57):**  But what was the absolute worst time?  
**[0:35:00-0:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:00):**  Probably about four, three, four, five weeks after the actual hurricane, because things  
**[0:35:06-0:35:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  were so bad that help couldn't get in there to make it better.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:10):**  So the worst time in a natural disaster isn't when the hurricane actually hit, which is  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  tillage.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:18):**  Okay.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:19):**  It actually takes a period of time.  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:21):**  Things are going to get worse before they get better.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  Does that make sense?  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:25):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:26):**  And that's exactly what's happening in our soils.  
**[0:35:28-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:28):**  If you're going to make your soils heal, you got to figure out what's wrong.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  And the big thing is, the compaction is the biggest problem.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:37):**  When you have compaction, you're going to get more denitrification, you're going to  
**[0:35:41-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:41):**  have less nitrogen.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:45):**  And because you have less nitrogen, your yields start to go down.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  Until you break that compacted layer up, that's going to be a problem.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:53):**  The other thing is, you've got to change your microbial community.  
**[0:35:57-0:35:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:57):**  And that takes a little bit of time.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:58):**  It can take you one, two, three years to change that microbial community.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  In a conventional tilled system, it's dominated by bacteria.  
**[0:36:06-0:36:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:06):**  Bacteria live six hours, maybe a couple days at the most.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  Fungi live many, many years.  
**[0:36:14-0:36:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  And it can take a couple years to build those populations back up.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:19):**  So that's why we see that dip until you start to make the transition.  
**[0:36:23-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  And then the other thing is, you got to get the air.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  You got to get the pore space back in there so that you can get the carbon and all the  
**[0:36:30-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:30):**  nutrients to recycle.  
**[0:36:32-0:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  And you got to get the right biology.  
**[0:36:34-0:36:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:34):**  So there's a lot going on with no-till.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:36):**  That's why we typically see that two to three, sometimes up to a five to seven year dip.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  Now the best way to make that go quicker is to add cover crops.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:47):**  Go with a multi-species cover crop the first year.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  Or even better yet, put it into a hay crop where you already have the biology and you  
**[0:36:56-0:36:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:56):**  have already kind of broken that soil up.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:59):**  It's a lot easier to go into no-till, say into a perennial crop like hay or pasture  
**[0:37:05-0:37:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:05):**  or CRP, Conservation Reserve Program.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:09):**  You can make that transition a lot quicker.  
**[0:37:11-0:37:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  The hardest place, and this is what 90, 95% of the people do, is they try to do it on  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:16):**  a corn-soybean rotation.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  Just adding wheat one year and after the wheat, putting in a multi-species cover crop will  
**[0:37:25-0:37:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:25):**  greatly increase your chances for success for no-till the next year.  
**[0:37:31-0:37:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:31):**  You got to heal the soil and we got to find ways to heal it quicker.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:35):**  And any way that you can add more carbon back into that soil and get those root accidents  
**[0:37:41-0:37:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:41):**  and that microbial poop and all that active carbon in the soil to heal the soil, that's  
**[0:37:48-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:48):**  going to make your soils perform better.  
**[0:37:51-0:37:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:51):**  It can take one, two, three years, sometimes if you're really going slow and you're doing  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:56):**  corn after soybeans and you didn't get rid of the compaction, it can take seven to nine  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  years to make that transition.  
**[0:38:02-0:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  But I just told you a whole lot of things you can do to speed this thing up.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  Manure is just really, really great.  
**[0:38:10-0:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:10):**  We're mimicking the bison, the buffalo.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:13):**  So adding some manure and getting more roots and healthier plants out there can really  
**[0:38:19-0:38:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:19):**  restore a soil fairly quickly.  
**[0:38:23-0:38:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:23):**  You'll get twice as many roots, twice as much biomass if you fertilize your cover crops  
**[0:38:28-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:28):**  with some manure.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:31):**  So it can just really help to speed up the process a little bit.  
**[0:38:35-0:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:35):**  Does that make sense?  
**[0:38:36-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:36):**  It makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  If you think about manure on a smaller scale, people add compost.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  How do you view building soil from the top down versus the bottom up?  
**[0:38:45-0:38:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:45):**  The bottom up approach is we're going to put a bunch of roots in there, get the carbon

**[0:38:52-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:52):**  The top down approach is we're going to either bring in grazing animals, we're going to apply

**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:59):**  How do you view those two as how they build organic matter?  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  Absolutely complementary.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  If you can add grazing animals, that's the optimal because now you've got the urine,  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:14):**  you've got the feces, you're maybe doing some disturbance on the top, but you're getting  
**[0:39:21-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  a lot of root turnover.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  Every time that cow or sheep goes down to graze, what happens is you've got more root  
**[0:39:31-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:31):**  growth than you do top growth, so those roots are going to die back until they can support

**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:51):**  So light rates, you gotta think like the buffalo.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:55):**  The buffalo would move around, they would graze and they would deposit their manure  
**[0:44:00-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  and go away for a couple months and then come back and regraise again.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:06):**  Think about what the buffalo did, is they spread their manure thin and that would be  
**[0:44:12-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:12):**  incorporated into the soil and would fertilize the plants and then they would come back and

**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:19):**  So that's really what we need to do but getting there can be a little bit difficult.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  When you've degraded your soils as much as we have, it can take a little bit of time  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:28):**  to get that soil life back in there again.  
**[0:44:32-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:32):**  So you just have to be a little patient or you can do things like doing multi-species

**[0:44:46-0:44:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:46):**  That will speed it up faster than anything else that you can do.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:50):**  But if you can't graze it, maybe you can mow it at a couple different heights and things

**[0:45:13-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:13):**  You let it grow about three, four feet tall, mowing off high, maybe eight to 12 inches

**[0:46:25-0:46:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:25):**  80-85% of the soil organic matter is actually a root.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:29):**  What the residue does on the surface is protects the soil from rainfall impact generally.

**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:41):**  And I like to talk about this because I think this is really important.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:45):**  What do you think the average soil erosion rate is in the United States?  
**[0:46:49-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  The average soil erosion rate across the whole United States is 7.6 tons per acre.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  Now most people can't visualize a ton, so let's break it down into pounds.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  If you take that times 2,000, that's 15,200 pounds of soil that erodes on average off  
**[0:47:09-0:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  of every acre of land.  
**[0:47:10-0:47:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:10):**  Now some soils will be 2, some will be 15.  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:14):**  Let's think about what the average soybean yield is in the United States.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  50 bushel.  
**[0:47:21-0:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  50 times 60 pounds per bushel is 3,000.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:26):**  And here's a startling statistic.  
**[0:47:29-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:29):**  On average in the United States, for every one pound of soybeans that we produce, we're  
**[0:47:35-0:47:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  losing five pounds of topsoil.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:37):**  Is that sustainable?  
**[0:47:41-0:47:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:41):**  It's not.  
**[0:47:42-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:42):**  It's not sustainable.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:43):**  And even when you do the numbers for corn, just simply because we have more biomass,  
**[0:47:48-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  on average we're losing about 1.5 to 1.7, 1.8 pounds of topsoil for every one pound  
**[0:47:55-0:47:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  of corn that we produce.  
**[0:47:59-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:59):**  So even on corn it's not sustainable.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  We need to get that down.  
**[0:48:05-0:48:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:05):**  The average soil is only going to add about 1,000 pounds of topsoil.  
**[0:48:10-0:48:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:10):**  And everybody will say, well, how do you add topsoil?  
**[0:48:12-0:48:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:12):**  Well, think about what soil it's made of.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:15):**  It's made out of rocks, ground up rocks.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  So on average, the rocks in the soil will decompose or break down into sand, silt, and  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:24):**  clay at about 1,000 pounds.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:26):**  That's just an average number, about 1,000 pounds a year.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  That's a half a ton.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:32):**  So if we want to be sustainable, if we want to talk, you know, this idea that we can lose  
**[0:48:37-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:37):**  four to five ton an acre and be sustainable, NRCS came up with that years ago, well, that's  
**[0:48:45-0:48:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  nowhere close.  
**[0:48:47-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:47):**  We need to be losing less than 1,000 pounds of topsoil, that's less than a half a ton  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  per acre in order to be sustainable.  
**[0:48:56-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:56):**  And I often ask this question, is it, should we try to get soil erosion down to zero?  
**[0:49:03-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  And the answer is no, that's not even natural either because the fish and the wildlife in  
**[0:49:10-0:49:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:10):**  the water do need some nutrients.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:12):**  So maybe 200, 300, 500 pounds loss is a sustainable level.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  Just as long as we're not losing over 1,000 pounds, we want to be below 1,000 pounds.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  I don't know what the absolute, you know, the best level would be, but you do have to  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:27):**  have a little bit and we're never going to get it down to the point where we don't have  
**[0:49:31-0:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:31):**  some erosion.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:32):**  So it's not something we probably really need to worry about.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:35):**  But a lot of people think that all erosion is bad.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:37):**  No, it's a balance.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:38):**  Okay.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:39):**  So water erosion is okay, but it's a very little, very little erosion.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:44):**  We don't want a lot.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  And right now we're way over out of whack on soil erosion in the United States.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  If we would just concentrate on soil erosion and minimizing soil erosion, we would fix  
**[0:49:56-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  so many problems.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  Because in order to fix soil erosion, we would have to improve soil health and we would make  
**[0:50:03-0:50:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:03):**  nutrient availability better and we would have a lot less water pollution.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:09):**  And nutrient runoff.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:11):**  If we just concentrated on soil erosion again, I think we would get there quicker than thinking  
**[0:50:16-0:50:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:16):**  about making this too complicated and thinking about water quality and trying to improve  
**[0:50:21-0:50:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:21):**  it.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:22):**  Just concentrate on the big thing, soil erosion.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:25):**  And the things that fix soil erosion are the same thing that's going to fix your nutrient  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:29):**  recycling, less fertilizer needs, and you'll have a lot less nutrient runoff.  
**[0:50:35-0:50:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:35):**  Sometimes we make things just a little too complicated.  
**[0:50:36-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:36):**  That's what we do as people.  
**[0:50:38-0:50:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  You know, it's a human thing.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:40):**  If you think about a thousand pounds of acre in a great system where somebody's doing quote  
**[0:50:45-0:50:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:45):**  everything right, how much topsoil do you think you could produce per acre per year?  
**[0:50:51-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:51):**  Okay, so the average number is about a thousand pounds.  
**[0:50:56-0:50:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  That's mainly the mineral portion.  
**[0:50:57-0:51:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:57):**  But when we're really talking about the portion that we really want to enhance in the soil  
**[0:51:03-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:03):**  is the organic matter.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  So when we're doing multi-species cover crops, we can get 20, 30, even up to 40, maybe as  
**[0:51:13-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  much as 50,000 pounds of residue.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  The problem with that is most of that is going to decompose and go up into the atmosphere.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  So we only keep maybe in the Midwest, we're losing anywhere from 60 to 80% of that.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  So let's just say 75% is lost.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:33):**  That means a quarter of whatever we're putting above ground is what we're going to add to  
**[0:51:41-0:51:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:41):**  our soil.  
**[0:51:42-0:51:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:42):**  So generally what we get above ground, we get below ground.  
**[0:51:44-0:51:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:44):**  So you can kind of do the numbers on your own and see how much you can add to your soil.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:48):**  It's going to vary by region a little bit.  
**[0:51:52-0:51:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:52):**  The more humid you are, the higher the temperature, the faster you lose organic matter.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:58):**  As you go north, it's interesting.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:01):**  The soils at the equator have the least amount of organic matter.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  As you go further and further north, soils have more and more organic matter.  
**[0:52:09-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:09):**  It all comes down to climate when it's cold and when it's drier as you get closer and  
**[0:52:15-0:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:15):**  closer to the Arctic Circle, it tends to get colder and drier and you keep the organic  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  matter there.  
**[0:52:25-0:52:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:25):**  Or if it is saturated, it's going to freeze and you're not going to have that breakdown.  
**[0:52:31-0:52:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:31):**  So it really depends on where you're located geographically.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:36):**  It depends on the climate, but it also depends on how much residue you're putting out there.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:42):**  So we can manipulate the residue and by growing multi-species cover crops, it's possible to  
**[0:52:49-0:52:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  add.  
**[0:52:50-0:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:50):**  I've talked to Dave Brant and his soils were down to about 2% here in Ohio.  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:55):**  And he has some fields that are now 8% organic matter.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:59):**  He's done that in about a 23-year time period.  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:02):**  But he really worked at it.  
**[0:53:04-0:53:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:04):**  In some fields, he really went overboard trying to get more and more organic matter there.  
**[0:53:09-0:53:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:09):**  It is possible to manipulate the system to do that.  
**[0:53:13-0:53:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:13):**  Is there an upper limit of where you think organic matter, you start to lose value in  
**[0:53:18-0:53:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:18):**  it?  
**[0:53:19-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:19):**  There's something wrong with the soil if organic matter keeps going up.  
**[0:53:22-0:53:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  It's not breaking it down.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:23):**  I've heard this statement, the whole point of organic matter is to lose it.  
**[0:53:27-0:53:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:27):**  What do you think about that?  
**[0:53:32-0:53:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:32):**  I haven't seen an upper limit yet and it's going to take you a long time to get there.  
**[0:53:36-0:53:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:36):**  So I really wouldn't worry about it.  
**[0:53:38-0:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:38):**  But let's just take an example.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:40):**  Our muck soils, they can be 30 to 50% organic matter.  
**[0:53:45-0:53:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:45):**  They produce really good crops, but they have to be drained.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:49):**  In the process of draining them, what happens?  
**[0:53:52-0:53:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:52):**  We oxidize them and they burn up.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:54):**  It's just like putting wood in a stove when you open that damper up and you put the oxygen  
**[0:53:59-0:54:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:59):**  in there, you're going to burn that carbon up.  
**[0:54:01-0:54:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:01):**  Well, in that carbon is a lot of nutrients and they can be extremely productive.  
**[0:54:06-0:54:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:06):**  So instead of thinking about trying to reach what I would call really high levels of organic  
**[0:54:16-0:54:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:16):**  matter, I would think about organic matter turnover.  
**[0:54:20-0:54:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:20):**  That's what's more important.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:21):**  So let me give you a real quick example.  
**[0:54:23-0:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:23):**  Let's think about a really good sandy loamy soil that has 1 to 2% organic matter.  
**[0:54:32-0:54:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:32):**  And then let's compare that to a heavy clay loam soil that has 5 to 6% organic matter.  
**[0:54:42-0:54:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:42):**  Can I produce 200 to 300 bushel corn on both of those?  
**[0:54:47-0:54:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:47):**  The answer is yes.  
**[0:54:48-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:48):**  But what's the difference?  
**[0:54:49-0:54:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  The difference on the 1 to 2% organic matter is we have very fast carbon turnover and the  
**[0:54:56-0:55:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:56):**  corn is going to grow quickly, but we're going to get fast carbon turnover.  
**[0:55:00-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:00):**  We need to keep replacing that carbon.  
**[0:55:02-0:55:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  We don't want to get it down too well.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:03):**  If you get it down like a half a percent, that's going to become like blow sand.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:08):**  It's just not going to do very well.  
**[0:55:09-0:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:09):**  But you have a pretty good sandy soil that has 2 to 3% organic matter that can produce  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:16):**  just as well as a 4, 5, 6% clay soil.  
**[0:55:21-0:55:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:21):**  Now the clay soil, the organic matter is very high, but it's turning over much slower.  
**[0:55:28-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:28):**  So it's not so much, it's really about a combination of organic accumulation, but it's also about  
**[0:55:37-0:55:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:37):**  organic turnover that's really important.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:41):**  Both systems we can get good crops.  
**[0:55:44-0:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:44):**  You just have to know that in a sandy soil, it's going to be very hard to get 5, 6, 8%  
**[0:55:51-0:55:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:51):**  organic matter on a sandy soil just because of the porosity that's there.  
**[0:55:55-0:55:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:55):**  There's a lot of oxygen there.  
**[0:55:57-0:56:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:57):**  But that doesn't mean you can't raise good crops.  
**[0:56:01-0:56:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  A good organic matter level on a sandy soil is going to be a lot different than a good  
**[0:56:05-0:56:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:05):**  organic matter on a clay soil.  
**[0:56:07-0:56:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:07):**  So you've got to understand those differences and it's really about organic matter turnover  
**[0:56:13-0:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:13):**  that we're looking at and when those nutrients are available.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  Both systems can do quite well for us.  
**[0:56:21-0:56:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:21):**  Does that kind of make sense?  
**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:22):**  It makes a lot of sense.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:24):**  Hopefully I keep asking you that.  
**[0:56:25-0:56:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:25):**  Yeah, no, I'm following along with you so you're doing a great job of explaining it.  
**[0:56:30-0:56:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:30):**  If you think about building organic matter, one way to do that is to keep that living  
**[0:56:34-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:34):**  root in the soil.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  You've talked a lot about multi-species cover crop.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:40):**  If somebody, to try and keep it as universal as possible, I know you're in Ohio, but to  
**[0:56:44-0:56:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:44):**  try and keep it geographically as universal as possible, how should somebody think about  
**[0:56:48-0:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:48):**  putting together a multi-species cover crop blend for their land if they're in a no-till  
**[0:56:55-0:56:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:55):**  system, they're looking to improve the quality of the soil, build topsoil, build organic  
**[0:56:59-0:57:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:59):**  matter?  
**[0:57:02-0:57:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:02):**  So what we need to think about in a multi-species mix is we want that diversity.  
**[0:57:08-0:57:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:08):**  So there's a couple different types of cover crops that we want to think about as a group.  
**[0:57:13-0:57:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:13):**  So you have your warm season cover crops.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:15):**  It kind of depends on the time of the year.  
**[0:57:18-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:18):**  Warm season cover crops are crops that are going to be grown in the summer.  
**[0:57:22-0:57:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  They're going to die with the first frost.  
**[0:57:23-0:57:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:23):**  So if you are planting them in the fall, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to plant  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:28):**  a warm season.  
**[0:57:29-0:57:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  But if you've got, say, after a week or you can have a long growing season and you can  
**[0:57:36-0:57:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:36):**  put in a warm season cover crop, try to do a mixture of warm season with cool season.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:43):**  Cool seasons are the ones that will survive the winter and will survive a frost.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:47):**  So you try to do a mixture.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:48):**  So that's one way of looking at it.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  We also like to see diversity in legumes or clovers that are going to add nitrogen.  
**[0:57:55-0:58:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:55):**  They typically tend to have more tap roots versus grasses which have finer roots and  
**[0:58:01-0:58:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:01):**  are going to add more carbon.  
**[0:58:03-0:58:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:03):**  So your legumes will add a little more nitrogen.  
**[0:58:05-0:58:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:05):**  Your grasses are going to add more carbon and we want to have a balance of those.  
**[0:58:09-0:58:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:09):**  Then we want to throw in maybe a couple brassicas.  
**[0:58:13-0:58:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:13):**  These can be warm and cool season just depending on your growing season.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:17):**  And then there might be some what we call other ones, things like buckwheat and sunflower.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:22):**  They can make really great pollinators to help us with soil health.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  So you try to get a diversity of different plants.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:30):**  Some people have experimented up to 15 or 20 different species.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:36):**  I would maybe when you're starting it can be a little more difficult.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:39):**  You might start off with say 3 to 5.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  And then if you're comfortable with that, try to go to 7 to 8 to 10.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  And then you can go wherever you want.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:49):**  But just remember seed cost does become an issue as you add more and more species.  
**[0:58:54-0:58:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  Some of these cost a lot more.  
**[0:58:56-0:59:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:56):**  Try to put in some of the species that are both small seeded because they tend to be  
**[0:59:01-0:59:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:01):**  quite a bit cheaper.  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:03):**  And if you put those in you only need maybe a quarter to half a pound.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:08):**  And they might only be just a couple bucks versus putting something that's really expensive.  
**[0:59:12-0:59:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:12):**  If you're getting up $5, $7, $10 a pound, it can get pretty expensive.  
**[0:59:18-0:59:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:18):**  I've seen cover crop mixes cost as little as $10 to $12 to as much as $100 an acre.  
**[0:59:26-0:59:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:26):**  And it's a lot harder to make that $100 an acre pay for itself.  
**[0:59:30-0:59:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:30):**  So there's a happy mix.  
**[0:59:32-0:59:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:32):**  Usually $20 to $25 an acre is what I try to stick with.  
**[0:59:36-0:59:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:36):**  Most people will go that if I can go a little bit cheaper in tough times, maybe go just  
**[0:59:40-0:59:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:40):**  a little cheaper and put in something that doesn't cost quite as much.  
**[0:59:44-0:59:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:44):**  And anything that has a live root is going to help you generally.  
**[0:59:49-0:59:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:49):**  You don't want to have weeds.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:51):**  The only reason I say that is if they go to seed, why then?  
**[0:59:55-0:59:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:55):**  Then you're going to be fighting your weeds.  
**[0:59:57-1:00:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:57):**  So try to find something that's a little easier to kill and maybe a little cheaper and can  
**[1:00:02-1:00:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:02):**  give you the most benefits possible.  
**[1:00:06-1:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:06):**  What if somebody was just fighting compaction and they weren't beholden to any sort of crop  
**[1:00:09-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:09):**  rotation?  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:10):**  Like in a perfect world they could take a few years off and just solve their compaction  
**[1:00:14-1:00:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:14):**  issues.  
**[1:00:15-1:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:15):**  Is there a species mix that you'd look at for really taking on compaction?  
**[1:00:22-1:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:22):**  Probably the best ones are some of the grasses really do a good job.  
**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:26):**  Sorghum sedan is one of the best compaction annual rye grass.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:33):**  Cereal rye does pretty good and so does oats.  
**[1:00:35-1:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:35):**  Kind of in that about that order, those would be the ones on the grasses.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:38):**  On the brassicas, there's nothing probably better than the tillage radish or the daikon  
**[1:00:44-1:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:44):**  radish.  
**[1:00:45-1:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:45):**  As you said, tillage is a particular variety, whereas daikon is the species.  
**[1:00:51-1:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:51):**  So we're looking for the white radish, the daikon radish, and there's several different  
**[1:00:58-1:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:58):**  varieties.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:59):**  Guys are selling different ones out there.  
**[1:01:02-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:02):**  Different companies have different varieties of that.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:07):**  So the daikon is really good.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:09):**  A sunflower is really deep rooted.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  That can be a good one.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:14):**  Buckwheat is really shallow rooted.  
**[1:01:15-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  So if you have shallow compaction, go with buckwheat and phacelia.  
**[1:01:20-1:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:20):**  If you have really deep compaction and you're trying to break it up, go with something like  
**[1:01:25-1:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:25):**  alfalfa and your sunflower are all very deep roots.  
**[1:01:30-1:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:30):**  So it kind of really depends on what your situation is.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:33):**  And even better is if you can graze it or utilize that as a forage, well then that helps  
**[1:01:39-1:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:39):**  to pay for that cover crop.  
**[1:01:41-1:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:41):**  You know, with something like a sorghum sedan grass, it can grow to be huge and 10 feet  
**[1:01:46-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:46):**  tall in the right climate.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  Yeah.  
**[1:01:48-1:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:48):**  So what do you get, you probably hear this all the time, of reconciling the nutrient  
**[1:01:53-1:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:53):**  use versus the benefit.  
**[1:01:55-1:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:55):**  Oh, that big plant, it's going to take all that biomass, it's got to produce it, it's  
**[1:01:59-1:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:59):**  going to take all the nutrients out of the soil to make that biomass.  
**[1:02:03-1:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:03):**  Am I not creating this problem where now I'm going to have to over amend to put all that  
**[1:02:08-1:02:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:08):**  stuff back?  
**[1:02:12-1:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:12):**  It depends on what you're doing with it.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:13):**  If you're not harvesting it, all you're doing is bringing nutrients to the soil surface,  
**[1:02:19-1:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:19):**  and then the biology will pull it deeper back into the soil and recycle it.  
**[1:02:24-1:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:24):**  Okay.  
**[1:02:25-1:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:25):**  Now if you're harvesting it, and you're going to take it off, well hopefully if you're going  
**[1:02:29-1:02:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  to take it off, then you've got the manure as a byproduct that you can put it back.  
**[1:02:33-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:33):**  Now if you go to sell it, that's where you've got a problem, then you can.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  But in some places that can actually be a strategy.  
**[1:02:41-1:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:41):**  So we have areas that have extremely high phosphorus, excess nutrients, water quality  
**[1:02:47-1:02:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:47):**  issues, we can use sorghum sedan as a crop that we can harvest multiple times, maybe  
**[1:02:53-1:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:53):**  three, four cuttings a year, and take that almost off like alfalfa hay, feed it to cattle,  
**[1:02:59-1:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:59):**  but we're going to ship it maybe 100, 200 miles away, away from an area where we have  
**[1:03:06-1:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:06):**  water quality, and we can actually start to lower the nutrients in the soil.  
**[1:03:10-1:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:10):**  So you've got to use it to your advantage is what I'm saying.  
**[1:03:14-1:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:14):**  And as long as you're keeping that on the soil and you're putting the manure back, it's  
**[1:03:18-1:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:18):**  not really a big issue.  
**[1:03:20-1:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:20):**  We're kind of mimicking those buffalo, and the buffalo and the bison there, they had  
**[1:03:26-1:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:26):**  a real nice cycle going on, and the crops grew really well, and we just kept improving  
**[1:03:32-1:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:32):**  the soil every year.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:34):**  Carbon is our limiting element in the soil, so that's the one we need to give.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:38):**  So I can tell you a real quick story about carbon.  
**[1:03:41-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:41):**  So let's say you're trying to grow 200 bushel corn.  
**[1:03:46-1:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  How much carbon do you need on a daily basis to grow 200 bushel corn?  
**[1:03:50-1:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:50):**  Have you ever thought about that?  
**[1:03:51-1:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:51):**  Well, you need about 100 pounds.  
**[1:03:54-1:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:54):**  Where does that carbon come from?  
**[1:03:56-1:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:56):**  Well, most of us have been taught it comes from the atmosphere, but if you want to all  
**[1:04:01-1:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:01):**  come just from the atmosphere and no place else, you would need an area of about 32 to  
**[1:04:07-1:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:07):**  33 cubic acres of air to get 100 pounds of carbon out of the atmosphere.  
**[1:04:13-1:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:13):**  So when we start to think about this, where is the carbon coming from?  
**[1:04:17-1:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:17):**  It's actually coming from the roots.  
**[1:04:20-1:04:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:20):**  The concentration in the atmosphere is around 400 to 410 parts per million.  
**[1:04:26-1:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:26):**  The concentration of carbon in the root zone is about 3,000 to 10,000 parts per million.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:34):**  So let's think about this just a little bit.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:36):**  So what do leaves take in?  
**[1:04:40-1:04:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:40):**  They're taking in carbon dioxide and they're giving off oxygen, right?  
**[1:04:45-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:45):**  What do the roots take in?  
**[1:04:47-1:04:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  Roots take in oxygen and they're giving off carbon dioxide.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:52):**  And it even gets a little bit better.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  As we get to the lower night temperatures, we can raise that carbon concentration in  
**[1:05:01-1:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:01):**  that soil up from about 3,000 to 10,000 up to maybe 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 parts per  
**[1:05:09-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:09):**  million at daybreak.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  And then let's think about photosynthesis.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:14):**  How effective are we on photosynthesis?  
**[1:05:16-1:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:16):**  Do you realize that within about the first one, two hours at the most, we've used up  
**[1:05:22-1:05:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:22):**  all of our carbon dioxide reserves in that soil within just a very short period of time,  
**[1:05:28-1:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:28):**  we're only about 10 to 20 percent efficient at photosynthesis.  
**[1:05:33-1:05:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:33):**  And it's all due to a lack of carbon dioxide in the soil.  
**[1:05:38-1:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:38):**  We used to have 6 to 8 percent organic matter.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:43):**  We've lost 60 to 80 percent of our carbon from our soils.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:48):**  We're now down to an average probably 2, 2.5, 3 percent organic matter.

**[1:12:18-1:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:18):**  And what the plants figured out is that they were very good at photosynthesis.  
**[1:12:25-1:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:25):**  And we have a tremendous...  
**[1:12:26-1:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:26):**  We're only 15 to 20% efficient.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:28):**  So let's think about corn.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:30):**  What is the optimum...  
**[1:12:31-1:12:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:31):**  I shouldn't say optimal, but what's the highest level of corn production that could be possible?  
**[1:12:38-1:12:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:38):**  The scientists have looked at this and said, we could produce 1100 bushels of corn per

**[1:12:44-1:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:44):**  What's our current level?  
**[1:12:46-1:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:46):**  Let's just say we average 200, and a lot of places don't.  
**[1:12:49-1:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:49):**  Maybe it's 150, 200, but 200 is an easy number.  
**[1:12:54-1:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:54):**  We're only roughly 20% efficient at photosynthesis.  
**[1:12:59-1:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:59):**  In order to get 1100, everything would have to be absolutely perfect.  
**[1:13:02-1:13:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:02):**  And we'll probably not reach that level on average, but is it possible to reach four,  
**[1:13:07-1:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:07):**  five, six, even 700 bushels?  
**[1:13:10-1:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:10):**  It could be if we were to improve the soil enough.  
**[1:13:13-1:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:13):**  And to get it back to where it was, you'd almost have to go back to maybe having those  
**[1:13:19-1:13:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:19):**  virgin type soils.  
**[1:13:21-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:21):**  And that's kind of what we're doing with the cover crops and soil health is we're restoring  
**[1:13:25-1:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  our soil.  
**[1:13:27-1:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:27):**  Very easy to think about this.  
**[1:13:29-1:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:29):**  Think about Brazil.  
**[1:13:31-1:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:31):**  Okay.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:32):**  Brazil has what we call oxisol soils.  
**[1:13:36-1:13:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:36):**  These are worn out soils.  
**[1:13:37-1:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:37):**  They have a lot of rainfall, 60 to 80 inches, 120 inches a year.  
**[1:13:43-1:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:43):**  They've really flushed out a lot of the nutrients out of their soil.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  And yet today when we go to Brazil, what are their soybean yields?  
**[1:13:51-1:13:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:51):**  Well, they're getting 50, 60, 70, even 80 bushel soybeans off of soils that are worn

**[1:14:01-1:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:01):**  Well, they took the tropics and they basically burned up the organic matter in the trees.  
**[1:14:08-1:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:08):**  And within about four or five years, their soils would get harder to rock.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:11):**  When they started growing cover crops, and now what they're finding is they're turning  
**[1:14:16-1:14:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:16):**  those oxisol soils, worn out soils, and they're becoming more and more like mullet soils every

**[1:14:23-1:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:23):**  Okay.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:24):**  They're putting a cover crop, then they grow their next crop, and then they grow cover  
**[1:14:28-1:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:28):**  crop.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:29):**  And they're even interseeding cover crops into their beans.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:33):**  They have now gotten, they were starting out, they were getting 80 bushel corn.  
**[1:14:37-1:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:37):**  Well, now they're going to become one of our biggest competitors on corn.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:41):**  They have now raised their corn yields up to 130, 140, 150, even 160 bushel per acre.  
**[1:14:48-1:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:48):**  They're not that far behind us.  
**[1:14:50-1:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:50):**  And what they've done over the last 30, 40, 50 years is they have transitioned their soils  
**[1:14:55-1:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:55):**  from oxisols into more and more like a mullet soil.  
**[1:15:01-1:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:01):**  Now they're not mullet soils yet, but if you look at it, they're adding so much organic  
**[1:15:06-1:15:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:06):**  matter to their soils and they're long term no-till down there and using extensive cover  
**[1:15:12-1:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:12):**  crops.  
**[1:15:13-1:15:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:13):**  80, 90% of their soils now have cover crops and no-till.  
**[1:15:17-1:15:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:17):**  The guys that will do just, do conventional tillage, what they find within four to five

**[1:15:35-1:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:35):**  Our soils are becoming compacted.  
**[1:15:38-1:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:38):**  They're becoming like rock.

**[1:15:54-1:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:54):**  that we talked about.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:56):**  Basically minimize soil disturbance, maximize live roots, maximize surface residue, and  
**[1:16:03-1:16:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:03):**  maximize your biodiversity.  
**[1:16:05-1:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:05):**  Those four things, and some people like to add the fifth principle, which is grazing,  
**[1:16:10-1:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:10):**  add livestock.  
**[1:16:12-1:16:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:12):**  And if you did those four or five principles, that's the fastest way to improve the soil.  
**[1:16:18-1:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:18):**  It's almost guaranteed to make it better as long as you don't do something between here.  
**[1:16:24-1:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:24):**  We can add a lot of chemicals and things like that.  
**[1:16:26-1:16:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:26):**  We could screw it up, I guess.  
**[1:16:29-1:16:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:29):**  But if you just kind of let the system alone, it will heal itself.

**[1:16:34-1:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:34):**  We have a lot of CRP land.

**[1:16:39-1:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:39):**  So somebody will take their worst field, and it's low in soil fertility.  
**[1:16:45-1:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:45):**  It has a lot of compassion.

**[1:16:52-1:16:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:52):**  And I have guys in my area that are looking for that CRP ground.

**[1:16:57-1:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:57):**  Because that soil has healed itself.  
**[1:16:59-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:59):**  Now there's two ways to farm CRP.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:02):**  I'll tell you the way that it's typically done.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:05):**  Guys will go in there, and they'll start tilling it up, and within four or five years, they'll

**[1:17:10-1:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:10):**  But for four or five years, they'll get tremendous nutrients and tremendous yields, and then  
**[1:17:16-1:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:16):**  they'll restore it back to its degraded condition in about four or five, maybe six, seven, eight  
**[1:17:20-1:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:20):**  years.  
**[1:17:21-1:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:21):**  Okay?  
**[1:17:22-1:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:22):**  Now what's the smart way to handle it?  
**[1:17:24-1:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:24):**  Now that I've healed it, go and put cover crops back on there.  
**[1:17:28-1:17:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:28):**  Do it in a no-till system.  
**[1:17:30-1:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:30):**  Maybe start with beans for one or two years just to get a little extra nitrogen in there.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:35):**  But then go with a corn, bean, soybean rotation.  
**[1:17:39-1:17:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:39):**  Maintain that fertility.  
**[1:17:40-1:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:40):**  Keep it in that almost pristine state.  
**[1:17:44-1:17:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:44):**  And you can get extremely good yields off that.

**[1:17:57-1:17:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:57):**  Okay?  
**[1:17:58-1:18:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:58):**  So that's kind of what we're trying to do with the whole soil health thing is heal our  
**[1:18:03-1:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:03):**  soils, get them from a degraded state into a very productive and healthy soil again.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:10):**  That's what we're trying to do.  
**[1:18:11-1:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:11):**  Do you think the next step in the evolution is a companion planting or an inter-planting,  
**[1:18:17-1:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:17):**  having your cash crop grown with cover crops?  
**[1:18:21-1:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:21):**  I see a lot of things that are going on that are very interesting right now.  
**[1:18:27-1:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:27):**  We can plant, you know, what they do in Brazil.  
**[1:18:29-1:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:29):**  I kind of told you half the story, but another way that they do is they plant their corn.  
**[1:18:36-1:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:36):**  And in between the rows, they wait about three to five days, maybe a week.  
**[1:18:40-1:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:40):**  It kind of depends on the area.  
**[1:18:41-1:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:41):**  And then they'll plant sun hemp.  
**[1:18:43-1:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:43):**  And the sun hemp will grow with the corn, but it'll be behind the corn.  
**[1:18:47-1:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:47):**  And the corn will tassel and set an ear, and then the sun hemp grows above the corn.  
**[1:18:53-1:18:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:53):**  Now, the sun hemp is a big legume, and it'll have nodules that are as big as your thumb,  
**[1:18:58-1:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:58):**  okay?  
**[1:18:59-1:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:59):**  And it can put on 200 pounds of nitrogen.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:02):**  They don't fertilize their corn in Brazil.  
**[1:19:05-1:19:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:05):**  They just use the companion cropping, the sun hemp, okay?  
**[1:19:09-1:19:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:09):**  And what they'll do is they'll let the corn dry down.  
**[1:19:14-1:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:14):**  They'll go through with a real high combine, and they'll harvest the sun hemp and get that  
**[1:19:19-1:19:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:19):**  as an oil seed.  
**[1:19:20-1:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:20):**  And they can use that both for feed and also for another cover crop.  
**[1:19:25-1:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:25):**  But then they'll turn around, come back at a later date, and harvest their corn.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:29):**  And then they'll plant a cover crop until they plant their next crop, which is either  
**[1:19:35-1:19:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:35):**  soybeans or maybe they go back to corn again.  
**[1:19:37-1:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:37):**  Kind of depends on the area.  
**[1:19:39-1:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:39):**  But that's kind of a nice system, okay?  
**[1:19:41-1:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:41):**  We can do the same thing up here, but we have a little bit shorter growing season.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:46):**  So what some people are doing is they're interseeding cover crops.  
**[1:19:49-1:19:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:49):**  Generally, what we're seeing is guys are starting to widen their rows out.  
**[1:19:53-1:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:53):**  I see a lot of twin row corn now starting to be experimented with, where they'll have  
**[1:19:58-1:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:58):**  60-inch rows.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:00):**  And some guys are planting their corn really thick there, but they're getting more sunlight  
**[1:20:04-1:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:04):**  in there.  
**[1:20:06-1:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:06):**  And if they've got a flexier on that, a variety, they can actually get bigger ears and get  
**[1:20:11-1:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:11):**  the same yield, same amount of corn, and just as good, maybe even better yields.  
**[1:20:15-1:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:15):**  But now they've got this wide area there that they can put a cover crop, and that cover  
**[1:20:19-1:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:19):**  crop can grow real well.  
**[1:20:21-1:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:21):**  And some of them are even introducing sheep or something like that, that they'll graze  
**[1:20:26-1:20:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:26):**  that.  
**[1:20:27-1:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:27):**  I've had some where I've looked at these fields, and the corn is so close together, it almost  
**[1:20:31-1:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:31):**  looks like the kale bars, okay?  
**[1:20:34-1:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:34):**  The sheep would have to go all the way to the end to get through there unless they're  
**[1:20:37-1:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:37):**  going to knock down the corn.  
**[1:20:38-1:20:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:38):**  So there's some things like that that are starting to go on that I think are really  
**[1:20:43-1:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:43):**  interesting that I think is going to help us with this.  
**[1:20:48-1:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:48):**  This companion cropping, we do some of that.  
**[1:20:51-1:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:51):**  We let your corn get up, grow with a little bit shorter maturity in corn, and you can  
**[1:20:57-1:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:57):**  fly on or use a high boy and get your cover crops.  
**[1:21:01-1:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:01):**  That's more of an interseeding top option, late, say about right now in August and early  
**[1:21:07-1:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:07):**  September, we can put on the cover crop and kind of get one started and always have a  
**[1:21:12-1:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:12):**  live crop out there year round.  
**[1:21:14-1:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:14):**  That would be the absolute goal.  
**[1:21:16-1:21:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:16):**  So there's a lot of different ways to go with this.  
**[1:21:18-1:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:18):**  Some of them are using, I see some research going on on cura clover.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:23):**  Guys are actually putting a crop down, and they'll stunt that clover a little bit, and  
**[1:21:28-1:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:28):**  they'll plant their corn into it, and that's supplying their nitrogen.  
**[1:21:32-1:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:32):**  And then as the temperatures get a little cooler and the corn's drying down, sunlight  
**[1:21:36-1:21:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:36):**  comes out, the cura clover grows the best in the spring and in the fall.  
**[1:21:41-1:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:41):**  And then the next year, they'll go right back to corn.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:44):**  They'll let the cura clover grow through the winter, and then they'll plant another crop.  
**[1:21:49-1:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:49):**  So I think there's a lot of different ways to slice this and try a lot of different things.  
**[1:21:54-1:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:54):**  Yeah, a lot of innovation out there.  
**[1:21:58-1:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:58):**  What have you seen in systems that have really healthy soil in terms of plant health, pest  
**[1:22:05-1:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:05):**  resistance?  
**[1:22:06-1:22:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:06):**  Do you notice a correlation between soil health and plant health?  
**[1:22:10-1:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:10):**  That's something that a lot of people claim.  
**[1:22:11-1:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:11):**  There's mixed feelings.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:12):**  What are your thoughts?  
**[1:22:14-1:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:14):**  Yeah.  
**[1:22:15-1:22:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:15):**  Where you have healthy soils, one of the reasons, one of the things that I've studied some is  
**[1:22:22-1:22:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:22):**  pest suppression.  
**[1:22:26-1:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:26):**  Most insects go after unhealthy plants.  
**[1:22:30-1:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:30):**  And unfortunately, when you raise crops on degraded soils, do you think you get healthy  
**[1:22:35-1:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:35):**  plants?  
**[1:22:36-1:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:36):**  Well, you get incomplete photosynthesis.  
**[1:22:39-1:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:39):**  And when you have incomplete photosynthesis, you get a lot of nitrates in your plants,  
**[1:22:44-1:22:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:44):**  and you don't get full protein synthesis.  
**[1:22:49-1:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:49):**  Insects love nitrates.  
**[1:22:50-1:22:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:50):**  And when they sense that a plant is unhealthy, they'll attack it.  
**[1:22:54-1:22:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:54):**  And that's why most, a lot of our plants, since they're unhealthy, the insects, we see  
**[1:22:59-1:23:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:59):**  a lot of insects.  
**[1:23:00-1:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:00):**  But if you have a healthy plant, the insects can sense that, that you have full protein  
**[1:23:06-1:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:06):**  synthesis, you'll have higher protein content, you'll have higher test weights, you'll have  
**[1:23:12-1:23:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:12):**  more dense food, and the insects will leave that alone because they cannot digest the  
**[1:23:19-1:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:19):**  amino acids and the full proteins in there, as well as they can the nitrates.  
**[1:23:24-1:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:24):**  So a lot of our plants, even though maybe we're getting pretty good yields, the nutrient  
**[1:23:32-1:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:32):**  density is a lot lower, the protein content is lower.  
**[1:23:36-1:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:36):**  We've kind of assumed that high yields, all crops are the same, that the yields are all  
**[1:23:42-1:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:42):**  the same.  
**[1:23:43-1:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:43):**  But really, we should be talking yield wise, we should be thinking about total pounds of  
**[1:23:48-1:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:48):**  protein versus just yields.  
**[1:23:52-1:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:52):**  Yield is one of those things that, you know, I can have 300 bushel corn, and let's just  
**[1:23:57-1:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:57):**  say it has 5%, let's keep the numbers even, 5% crude protein.  
**[1:24:04-1:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:04):**  Okay.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:05):**  Well, let's compare that to say 200 bushel corn, or let's just make, yeah, say 200 bushel  
**[1:24:11-1:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:11):**  corn.  
**[1:24:12-1:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:12):**  What if I had 200 bushel corn?  
**[1:24:15-1:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:15):**  And just to make the math easy, generally it'd be maybe 8%, 9%, but let's just say it's  
**[1:24:19-1:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:19):**  10%.  
**[1:24:20-1:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:20):**  Take 200 bushel times 10 to 10% crude protein and then take 300 times 5% crude protein.  
**[1:24:31-1:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:31):**  You can see that the 200 bushel corn actually has more protein in it.  
**[1:24:35-1:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:35):**  And if you feed that to a cattle or to a hog or to a chicken, they will eat all of the

**[1:24:47-1:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:47):**  for them, they'll eat all that first before they'll eat the low density.  
**[1:24:50-1:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:50):**  So we really ought to be talking about nutrient density and even human health.  
**[1:24:56-1:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:56):**  They're all related.  
**[1:24:57-1:25:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:57):**  A lot of these, you know, if you look over the last 40, 50 years, there's a much higher  
**[1:25:02-1:25:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:02):**  incidence I happen to be diabetic.  
**[1:25:05-1:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:05):**  So diabetic, autism, all these diseases, yes, yields have gone up in the United States,  
**[1:25:13-1:25:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:13):**  but with that has come less nutrient density.  
**[1:25:16-1:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:16):**  And some of this could be related to human health, some of the problems that we have  
**[1:25:19-1:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:19):**  with human health.  
**[1:25:20-1:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:20):**  Think about all the people with arthritis and all the aches and pains.  
**[1:25:24-1:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:24):**  Now it is true, we're living a little longer, but the quality of life in a lot of cases,  
**[1:25:30-1:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:30):**  if you look at our bone density and some of the things that are going on, we're not as  
**[1:25:35-1:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:35):**  maybe healthy as what we could be if we were eating better food.  
**[1:25:39-1:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:39):**  So I think it's all related.  
**[1:25:41-1:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:41):**  It's very interesting to study.  
**[1:25:44-1:25:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:44):**  I think there's a lot of new innovations out there, things that are, we're starting to

**[1:25:56-1:25:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:56):**  to look at this.  
**[1:25:57-1:26:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:57):**  I mean, we all know good food when we eat it.  
**[1:26:00-1:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:00):**  You can taste the difference.  
**[1:26:03-1:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:03):**  And those are the flavonoids.  
**[1:26:05-1:26:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:05):**  And our bodies, we're just like, in that sense, we're like a cow.  
**[1:26:10-1:26:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:10):**  If you give a person a bad, let's say a nutrient-dense tomato and one that's less nutrient-dense, if  
**[1:26:18-1:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:18):**  you bite into the one that tastes good, you'll eat all that one first.  
**[1:26:22-1:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:22):**  And if you're still hungry, you might go after the other one, but you'll say, man, this one  
**[1:26:25-1:26:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:25):**  just doesn't taste as good.  
**[1:26:27-1:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:27):**  We can sense the difference.  
**[1:26:29-1:26:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:29):**  We're just not quite as good at it as maybe the cow can smell it.  
**[1:26:32-1:26:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:32):**  We have to actually eat it or taste it before we're probably going to be able to tell the  
**[1:26:36-1:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:36):**  difference.  
**[1:26:37-1:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:37):**  You might be able to weigh it, but there are new machines out there.  
**[1:26:41-1:26:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:41):**  I don't know if you've heard about this, but they have now come up with one that's probably  
**[1:26:47-1:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:47):**  going to hit the supermarkets here pretty soon.  
**[1:26:49-1:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:49):**  It costs a couple hundred dollars, but you can actually test your produce now to tell  
**[1:26:54-1:26:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:54):**  you how nutrient-dense it is.  
**[1:26:56-1:26:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:56):**  So that's kind of a new innovation that's coming out that I think people will start  
**[1:26:59-1:27:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:59):**  to get into this nutrient density a little bit more.  
**[1:27:02-1:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:02):**  And that may have an influence on us and how we're going to be producing our produce in  
**[1:27:07-1:27:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:07):**  the future.  
**[1:27:08-1:27:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:08):**  So...  
**[1:27:09-1:27:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:09):**  Is it really come down to then, I know there's no absolute answer to this, and I don't think  
**[1:27:14-1:27:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:14):**  anybody knows, but is a healthier plant just lacking photosynthesis?  
**[1:27:19-1:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:19):**  It's not photosynthesizing at its full potential.  
**[1:27:23-1:27:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:23):**  The nutrients, the minerals might be there in the soil.  
**[1:27:26-1:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:26):**  It just can't get access to them.  
**[1:27:28-1:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:28):**  What's causing the plant to be healthier?  
**[1:27:31-1:27:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:31):**  This goes back to that yield thing of 200 bushel corn versus 1100 bushel corn.  
**[1:27:37-1:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:37):**  What could tip that limit?  
**[1:27:39-1:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:39):**  How do you get better photosynthesis?  
**[1:27:41-1:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:41):**  How do you get healthier plants?  
**[1:27:44-1:27:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:44):**  You got to have the microbes.  
**[1:27:47-1:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:47):**  It's all about that soil environment.  
**[1:27:50-1:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:50):**  When we start to till the soil, we get imbalance of microbes.  
**[1:27:54-1:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:54):**  We're mainly bacteria, not enough fungus.  
**[1:27:56-1:27:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:56):**  We want to have that balance.  
**[1:27:58-1:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:58):**  So the soil compaction is going to have an impact.  
**[1:28:02-1:28:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:02):**  You're going to have more bacteria.  
**[1:28:03-1:28:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:03):**  So now you're going to have that imbalance.  
**[1:28:05-1:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:05):**  You're not going to have the right nutrients.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:07):**  And if you don't have the right nutrients, you might have the nutrients there, but it  
**[1:28:10-1:28:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:10):**  may be in the wrong form.  
**[1:28:12-1:28:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:12):**  And if it's not plant available, then we're going to limit photosynthesis.  
**[1:28:15-1:28:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:15):**  So it's all these things combined.  
**[1:28:17-1:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:17):**  You got to have the right soil environment.  
**[1:28:20-1:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:20):**  You got to have the right microbes.  
**[1:28:22-1:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:22):**  And then a lot of times the nutrients are there, but they're in the wrong form.  
**[1:28:26-1:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:26):**  You got to have the right microbes to transform them into the right form so that they're plant  
**[1:28:33-1:28:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:33):**  available.  
**[1:28:34-1:28:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:34):**  And then that whole system then will add more carbon into your soil.  
**[1:28:38-1:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:38):**  Over time, you'll build up that carbon in your soil.  
**[1:28:41-1:28:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:41):**  Now you're at full production.  
**[1:28:43-1:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:43):**  But think about this.  
**[1:28:44-1:28:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:44):**  If we overuse fungicides, we start overusing the chemicals.  
**[1:28:48-1:28:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:48):**  Glyphosate is one of those examples.  
**[1:28:50-1:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:50):**  So we know that glyphosate is a key later.  
**[1:28:54-1:29:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:54):**  So it ties up a lot of micronutrients, especially manganese and a couple other things.  
**[1:29:01-1:29:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:01):**  But one of the things that we're seeing on almost all of our soybeans and a lot of our  
**[1:29:05-1:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:05):**  corn is it's manganese deficient.  
**[1:29:08-1:29:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:08):**  Well that's going to limit photosynthesis.  
**[1:29:12-1:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:12):**  And so the theory used to be that a lot of people would talk about the staves in a barrel.  
**[1:29:21-1:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:21):**  And they say whatever element is limiting, that's the one that's going to limit your  
**[1:29:28-1:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:28):**  photosynthesis, limit your yield.  
**[1:29:30-1:29:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:30):**  But what has happened over time is because we put on so many nutrients, sometimes we  
**[1:29:36-1:29:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:36):**  have an excess nutrient.  
**[1:29:38-1:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:38):**  So the barrel stave idea is the law of the minimum.  
**[1:29:43-1:29:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:43):**  Now we're starting to concentrate a little bit more on the law of the maximum.  
**[1:29:46-1:29:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:46):**  And what does the law of the maximum say?  
**[1:29:49-1:29:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:49):**  Every nutrient has an effect on other nutrients.  
**[1:29:53-1:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:53):**  So if you get too much of one nutrient, it can tie up some of the other nutrients.  
**[1:29:59-1:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:59):**  So maybe by actually cutting back, we tend to overapply nitrogen and phosphorus and even  
**[1:30:07-1:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:07):**  potash a lot or potassium.  
**[1:30:09-1:30:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:09):**  If we're overapplying them, we could be tying up some micronutrients.  
**[1:30:14-1:30:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:14):**  So maybe if we put on a little bit less of some of these and maybe we add a little bit  
**[1:30:19-1:30:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:19):**  of the other ones but we also improve the biology, all of a sudden we get things back  
**[1:30:24-1:30:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:24):**  into balance and all of a sudden our barrel, all of a sudden the staves are a little more  
**[1:30:30-1:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:30):**  even and we can hold more water in that barrel, which means we're basically generating more  
**[1:30:34-1:30:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:34):**  yield.  
**[1:30:35-1:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:35):**  So maybe not only more yield, but maybe more nutrient dense and healthier food at the same  
**[1:30:41-1:30:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:41):**  time.  
**[1:30:42-1:30:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:42):**  So it all works together.  
**[1:30:43-1:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:43):**  We got to understand it.  
**[1:30:44-1:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:44):**  That's why it's been a little bit complicated.  
**[1:30:47-1:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:47):**  We haven't understand how the pieces all move together and how they all fit together.  
**[1:30:51-1:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:51):**  We're starting to get a little clearer understanding on what we need to do to make this system  
**[1:30:55-1:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:55):**  work better.  
**[1:30:56-1:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:56):**  So again, glyphosate, what it does is it creates conditions that chelate manganese.  
**[1:31:04-1:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:04):**  Manganese is used by the plant to split the water molecule in half and if you don't have  
**[1:31:11-1:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:11):**  enough manganese, you're going to have incomplete photosynthesis.  
**[1:31:17-1:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:17):**  Glyphosate also causes more fusarium in the soil.  
**[1:31:21-1:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:21):**  So now we're getting this disease organism there.  
**[1:31:24-1:31:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:24):**  One good way to overcome glyphosate is actually oats.  
**[1:31:29-1:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:29):**  Oats does the exact opposite.  
**[1:31:31-1:31:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:31):**  It promotes manganese, makes manganese more plant available and it reduces some of the  
**[1:31:38-1:31:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:38):**  fusarium in the soil.  
**[1:31:39-1:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:39):**  So we can use cover crops.  
**[1:31:41-1:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:41):**  I would suggest that people who have really overused Roundup try to use like crimper rollers  
**[1:31:47-1:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:47):**  and maybe try to limit how much you use.  
**[1:31:51-1:31:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:51):**  If you're going to use Roundup, try to instead of using it three, four times a year or five  
**[1:31:56-1:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:56):**  times like they do in cotton, maybe try to use it only once or if you can get away without  
**[1:32:01-1:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:01):**  using it at all, use a crimper roller, use Gramaxone.  
**[1:32:04-1:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:04):**  We actually find with Gramaxone, we don't see a dip in soil health.  
**[1:32:08-1:32:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:08):**  Every time that we use Roundup, we'll actually see the soil health go down in the soil for  
**[1:32:13-1:32:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:13):**  a couple weeks until that soil recovers.  
**[1:32:17-1:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:17):**  But we really want to keep our microbes happy all the time.  
**[1:32:20-1:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:20):**  And I think glyphosate is starting to reach its economic life.  
**[1:32:25-1:32:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:25):**  There's a lot of lawsuits out there and we've overused it.  
**[1:32:30-1:32:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:30):**  And I think over time, we're probably going to have less reliance on glyphosate just because  
**[1:32:36-1:32:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:36):**  of the economic forces now and the resistance to the overuse of glyphosate.  
**[1:32:42-1:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:42):**  So we need to start thinking ahead of what are we going to use to replace that glyphosate  
**[1:32:48-1:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:48):**  and see if there isn't something else.  
**[1:32:49-1:32:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:49):**  I'm not saying we have to totally get rid of it.  
**[1:32:51-1:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:51):**  I'm just saying maybe we've overused it.  
**[1:32:54-1:32:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:54):**  Maybe we can cut back a little bit and we'll find out that maybe it actually improves our  
**[1:32:58-1:33:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:58):**  soil health a little bit more.  
**[1:33:02-1:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:02):**  It also has an impact on phosphorus.  
**[1:33:04-1:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:04):**  But that's pretty hard to talk about.  
**[1:33:07-1:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:07):**  I know just enough to be dangerous on that, so I prefer not to talk about it, but it can  
**[1:33:13-1:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:13):**  have an impact on that.  
**[1:33:15-1:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:15):**  I think one of the knocks on Big Ag is it's unsustainable.  
**[1:33:20-1:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:20):**  Corn and soil rotation, two crop rotations that, you know, seven tons of topsoil going  
**[1:33:27-1:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:27):**  off per year, you're using sprays, you're using all these inputs.  
**[1:33:32-1:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:32):**  Do you, based on what you know, and kind of intuiting the rest, do you think we could  
**[1:33:37-1:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:37):**  get to a day where we could keep the same amount of corn and soil production, only we  
**[1:33:44-1:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:44):**  could remove all inputs from the system, fertilizer inputs, by just cover cropping in there?  
**[1:33:51-1:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:51):**  So we're removing inputs.  
**[1:33:53-1:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:53):**  We replaced that with cover crops and our yields are near where they are now.  
**[1:34:00-1:34:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:00):**  Great question and we're headed down that road.  
**[1:34:03-1:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:03):**  So if you look at organic production and the interest in organic, there's like 10 times  
**[1:34:11-1:34:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:11):**  the demand for organic production.  
**[1:34:14-1:34:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:14):**  But what's the problem with organic?  
**[1:34:16-1:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:16):**  It's really not as organic as it sounds because we're doing tillage.  
**[1:34:20-1:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:20):**  So we're ruining soil structure with that.  
**[1:34:22-1:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:22):**  Now if you look at another road, if you look at the no-till and the cover crops, you know,  
**[1:34:29-1:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:29):**  we're still using chemicals, some herbicides and some fungicides and things like that,  
**[1:34:35-1:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:35):**  but more and more the no-till and the cover crops and that we're using less and less fungicides,  
**[1:34:41-1:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:41):**  less and less herbicides.  
**[1:34:42-1:34:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:42):**  I think the organic road and the no-till and the cover crop road are converging.  
**[1:34:49-1:34:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:49):**  The no-till and the cover crop guys are becoming more and more organic.  
**[1:34:54-1:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:54):**  The organic guys haven't quite figured it out yet, but they're starting to figure out.  
**[1:35:00-1:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:00):**  And there's one guy that kind of embodies this and that's Rick Clark.  
**[1:35:05-1:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:05):**  Rick Clark farms about 7,000 acres.  
**[1:35:08-1:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:08):**  He's long-term no-till, he's cover crops and he's now organic.  
**[1:35:13-1:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:13):**  Seven thousand acres, corn, soybeans and wheat.  
**[1:35:17-1:35:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:17):**  And what he's doing is he starts with maybe a hay crop and then he'll plant his corn into  
**[1:35:25-1:35:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:25):**  the hay, usually maybe used as an under cutter or terminates the hay, plants his corn, lets  
**[1:35:34-1:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:34):**  the corn come up.  
**[1:35:35-1:35:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:35):**  After the corn comes, he'll use a short season corn and then he'll plant two to three bushel  
**[1:35:42-1:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:42):**  of cereal rye into that.  
**[1:35:44-1:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:44):**  He'll roll that and plant, well first of all, he'll plant his beans into it, planting green.  
**[1:35:51-1:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:51):**  And then after the beans come up, maybe four or five inches tall, he'll roll it and now  
**[1:35:56-1:35:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:56):**  he's conserving moisture and he don't have to use herbicides.  
**[1:35:59-1:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:59):**  Now he has a few weeds, but he says after a couple years, he says we have very little  
**[1:36:03-1:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:03):**  weed seed.  
**[1:36:04-1:36:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:04):**  And then after the soybeans, he goes to wheat.  
**[1:36:08-1:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:08):**  After the wheat, he plants a 10-way mix of cover crops and then he'll plant his corn  
**[1:36:15-1:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:15):**  green into that and then he'll roll that and he's using hardly any herbicides.  
**[1:36:20-1:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:20):**  He's got hogs and he's got some cattle.  
**[1:36:23-1:36:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:23):**  There's his manure, there's his fertilizer, so he's not putting on a lot of fertilizer.  
**[1:36:28-1:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:28):**  He's not using treated seed and he's not using fungicides.  
**[1:36:33-1:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:33):**  And he will tell you that my yields are average, but my prices are way above average.  
**[1:36:41-1:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:41):**  I can live with average yields, but I'm making a lot more money by going organic because  
**[1:36:47-1:36:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:47):**  he's getting organic prices on that.  
**[1:36:50-1:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:50):**  And his nutrient density is going up, he's got better quality feed.  
**[1:36:55-1:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:55):**  So maybe if you think about it from a yield aspect, maybe he's getting average yields,  
**[1:37:00-1:37:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:00):**  but when you're looking at pounds of protein harvested per acre, he's probably actually  
**[1:37:05-1:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:05):**  outdoing some of the other guys that have slightly higher yields.  
**[1:37:08-1:37:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:08):**  But again, his price is compensating for that.  
**[1:37:12-1:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:12):**  He said farming has now become fun again because you don't have to worry about all the chemicals.  
**[1:37:17-1:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:17):**  So is it possible?  
**[1:37:18-1:37:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:18):**  It's already a reality.  
**[1:37:19-1:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:19):**  Do you know where his input costs are relative to a conventional farmer on the same amount  
**[1:37:25-1:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:25):**  of acreage?  
**[1:37:27-1:37:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:27):**  His input costs are so low and his prices are so much better, double what the other  
**[1:37:37-1:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:37):**  ones are that, yes, he's quite a bit more profitable than anybody else.  
**[1:37:41-1:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:41):**  That's really what it's about.  
**[1:37:44-1:37:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:44):**  Profitability per acre, he's sustainable, he's profitable, and he has nutrient-dense  
**[1:37:49-1:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:49):**  good food.  
**[1:37:50-1:37:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:50):**  I mean, he's hit the jackpot.  
**[1:37:52-1:37:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:52):**  Like I said, this is reality.  
**[1:37:54-1:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:54):**  It's already here.  
**[1:37:55-1:37:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:55):**  We're starting to go down that road.  
**[1:37:57-1:38:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:57):**  Now does he have a few problems now and then?  
**[1:38:00-1:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:00):**  Yes.  
**[1:38:01-1:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:01):**  But we have a lot of ways to work with this.  
**[1:38:02-1:38:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:02):**  We have leaders now that are gas-powered little robots that can go up and down the road and  
**[1:38:10-1:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:10):**  take out with electrical charge, take out weeds.  
**[1:38:13-1:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:13):**  We have the propane.  
**[1:38:16-1:38:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:16):**  You can go up and down the roads with propane and burn off some of the weeds.  
**[1:38:21-1:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:21):**  And if you have healthy plants, you're not going to have as many insects and things like  
**[1:38:26-1:38:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:26):**  that.  
**[1:38:27-1:38:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:27):**  He has less disease.  
**[1:38:28-1:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:28):**  He might have to work on his genetics and things.  
**[1:38:31-1:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:31):**  And that doesn't mean that once in a while he doesn't have a blow-up.  
**[1:38:35-1:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:35):**  There might be years where things don't go so well, but you know what?  
**[1:38:38-1:38:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:38):**  He's got pretty good profit margins.  
**[1:38:40-1:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:40):**  He's banking some of that money.  
**[1:38:42-1:38:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:42):**  He can take a hit once in a while.  
**[1:38:44-1:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:44):**  And like he says, farming now has become a lot more enjoyable than what it was just five,  
**[1:38:50-1:38:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:50):**  10 years ago when he was trying to really push yields.  
**[1:38:54-1:38:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:54):**  We really should be talking about optimal yields, not maximum yields.  
**[1:38:59-1:39:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:59):**  And maybe for him, optimal is just having average yields but having really good nutrient  
**[1:39:03-1:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:03):**  density.  
**[1:39:04-1:39:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:04):**  When we look at the protein levels again, that might actually be better.  
**[1:39:09-1:39:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:09):**  And it's much, much more profitable for him.  
**[1:39:11-1:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:11):**  His margins are low.  
**[1:39:12-1:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:12):**  Well, the most always doesn't equate with better.  
**[1:39:17-1:39:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:17):**  That's right.  
**[1:39:18-1:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:18):**  That's right.  
**[1:39:19-1:39:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:19):**  And a lot of people listening to this, they're working on one seven-thousandth of the land  
**[1:39:25-1:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:25):**  he is, and it works for him.  
**[1:39:26-1:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:26):**  So I know you work big ag, but for somebody growing on a small scale, like intensive vegetable  
**[1:39:32-1:39:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:32):**  production, how would you think about some of these principles if you were trying to  
**[1:39:36-1:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:36):**  integrate them into that?  
**[1:39:37-1:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:37):**  Is it the same thing, just try and continually cover crop, keep fields covered when they're  
**[1:39:42-1:39:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:42):**  not in use, maybe companion plant alongside or interplant tomatoes, but you have a cover  
**[1:39:46-1:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:46):**  crop alongside them.  
**[1:39:48-1:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:48):**  When you think about growing small scale vegetables, what do you think?  
**[1:39:52-1:39:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:52):**  Yes.  
**[1:39:53-1:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:53):**  So for vegetable production, what we see is cereal rye works really well.  
**[1:39:58-1:40:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:58):**  You can grow cereal rye and then you can roll it.  
**[1:40:01-1:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:01):**  And then after you roll it, you can transplant tomatoes, you can transplant melons, watermelon,  
**[1:40:09-1:40:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:09):**  muskmelon.  
**[1:40:10-1:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:10):**  It works really well with beans and peas.  
**[1:40:12-1:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:12):**  You can just plant the peas and the beans in there and then let them come up.  
**[1:40:17-1:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:17):**  A crop roller works really well because we're actually finding out with the crop roller  
**[1:40:24-1:40:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:24):**  that you let those beans or peas get up just a little bit.  
**[1:40:29-1:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:29):**  And when you nick them a little bit with the crop roller, it sends a hormonal response  
**[1:40:32-1:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:32):**  to them.  
**[1:40:33-1:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:33):**  They actually put on more pods per plant.  
**[1:40:37-1:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:37):**  So we're finding out that it now helps with weeds, that keeps the ground cooler, it conserves  
**[1:40:43-1:40:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:43):**  moisture, but it also gives you a little bit of a yield increase.  
**[1:40:48-1:40:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:48):**  There's a lot of ways of doing it.  
**[1:40:50-1:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:50):**  I think something else that people need to be looking at is some of the inoculants.  
**[1:40:57-1:41:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:57):**  I'm doing some little bit of research with worms, red worms.  
**[1:41:04-1:41:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:04):**  It takes three tons of, let's say, carbon straw or leaves or anything that's made of  
**[1:41:11-1:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:11):**  carbon will decompose with the worms down into about a ton of fertilizer.  
**[1:41:17-1:41:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:17):**  And so three to one is generally the ratio.  
**[1:41:20-1:41:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:20):**  That ton of fertilizer is worth about $400.  
**[1:41:23-1:41:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:23):**  And so you can put out some rows of just leaves that you get from the city if you wanted to.  
**[1:41:33-1:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:33):**  And you can put your worms in there and let them do the work for you.  
**[1:41:38-1:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:38):**  Takes about a year for that all to decompose and go and it's so rich in nitrogen, phosphorus,  
**[1:41:44-1:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:44):**  a lot of the micronutrients, and you can just keep adding to it a little bit.  
**[1:41:48-1:41:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:48):**  And then when the time comes, you can spread that out on your field and that makes a really,  
**[1:41:53-1:41:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:53):**  really good compost.  
**[1:41:54-1:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:54):**  I mean, the plants just absolutely go nuts on it because it's a highly enriched organic  
**[1:41:59-1:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:59):**  fertilizer and you can do it on your own.  
**[1:42:01-1:42:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:01):**  You don't have to pay someone.  
**[1:42:02-1:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:02):**  You got trucking involved, but unless you're growing it yourself, but most of the time  
**[1:42:07-1:42:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:07):**  you're probably going to get it from maybe another source.  
**[1:42:11-1:42:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:11):**  I'm looking into that myself, getting some leaves and maybe a straw or you might even  
**[1:42:16-1:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:16):**  if you're growing the sorghum, you can take the sorghum back if you wanted to cut some  
**[1:42:19-1:42:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:19):**  of that up and bale it.  
**[1:42:22-1:42:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:22):**  You could turn that into organic fertilizer that you could reapply maybe to other fields.  
**[1:42:28-1:42:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:28):**  Maybe you have one field that's a little high in nutrients, you can transfer some of those  
**[1:42:32-1:42:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:32):**  nutrients to another field that way.  
**[1:42:34-1:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:34):**  There's a lot of different ways to work this.  
**[1:42:35-1:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:35):**  Just depends on your situation.  
**[1:42:37-1:42:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:37):**  What about above ground amendments?  
**[1:42:40-1:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:40):**  You go to any ag trade show and you go to an exhibition hall and it's loaded with companies  
**[1:42:45-1:42:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:45):**  that have stuff that you can apply above ground.  
**[1:42:49-1:42:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:49):**  Micronutrients, enzymes, biostimulants, you name it.  
**[1:42:56-1:42:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:56):**  I think people love that stuff because it seems like a quick fix.  
**[1:42:59-1:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:59):**  It's easy, I can buy it, I can put it on and I feel like I did something.

**[1:43:06-1:43:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:06):**  You look at that stuff after you've minimized tillage, after you got a continual cover over  
**[1:43:12-1:43:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:12):**  the soil, after you have a lean root, then look at that stuff.  
**[1:43:17-1:43:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:17):**  I would agree with you.  
**[1:43:19-1:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:19):**  You're just going to put it on the first year.

**[1:45:21-1:45:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:21):**  The reason I know it works is I did some research on it between Christmas and New Year's a couple

**[1:45:35-1:45:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:35):**  Well, it just so happens that this company, it's Valen, it's their endo-prime.  
**[1:45:40-1:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:40):**  What's interesting, the reason I like that product is they give you a money-back guarantee  
**[1:45:45-1:45:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:45):**  that you'll get a yield increase.  
**[1:45:47-1:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:47):**  If you don't, now you have to go to the extra work, you put out a control plot where you

**[1:45:57-1:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:57):**  It's about 12 bucks an acre, but when you put that on, about 80% of the time they'll  
**[1:46:02-1:46:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:02):**  more than pay for the product.  
**[1:46:04-1:46:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:04):**  About 10, 15% of the time they'll get a yield increase, but they may not quite pay for it.  
**[1:46:10-1:46:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:10):**  I suspect the reason they may not quite pay for it, it's either one or two things.  
**[1:46:14-1:46:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:14):**  For example, on Dave Brant's, they tried it on his, Dave already had the microbes.  
**[1:46:18-1:46:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:18):**  Either you have the microbe or maybe you just don't quite have the right environmental conditions  
**[1:46:25-1:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:25):**  and it might take you two or three years until that will fully work for you.  
**[1:46:30-1:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:30):**  What they're finding out is these products work on these no-till fields with cover crops  
**[1:46:35-1:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:35):**  maybe two to three years after that you've been totally inoculated your field and you  
**[1:46:40-1:46:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:40):**  don't even need the product anymore.  
**[1:46:41-1:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:41):**  So it's a money-back guarantee.  
**[1:46:43-1:46:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:43):**  I think if they're going to give you a money-back guarantee, you have nothing to lose, I think  
**[1:46:48-1:46:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:48):**  then you can go ahead and try it.  
**[1:46:50-1:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:50):**  And what they like is the guys that do like strip-till, guys will put it on, they'll see  
**[1:46:55-1:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:55):**  enough of an economic advantage that they want the product, but they're going to need  
**[1:47:00-1:47:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:00):**  it every single year because the species that they have in there are so sensitive to tillage  
**[1:47:07-1:47:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:07):**  that they're killing them off every year.  
**[1:47:09-1:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:09):**  But they're still getting enough of an economic response that they're going to go ahead and  
**[1:47:12-1:47:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:12):**  buy it.  
**[1:47:13-1:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:13):**  And the other guy loves those guys.  
**[1:47:15-1:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:15):**  They don't like the long-term no-tillers and cover crops quite as much because they say,  
**[1:47:19-1:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:19):**  well, we can only sell them a product for two or three years and then we got to go find  
**[1:47:22-1:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:22):**  somebody else because now their fields are inoculated and they find out they don't need  
**[1:47:26-1:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:26):**  it anymore.  
**[1:47:27-1:47:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:27):**  So I do think some of these products can be good.  
**[1:47:31-1:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:31):**  The problem is there's just so many of them.  
**[1:47:35-1:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:35):**  And unless you do the trials, a lot of times they're not so good at telling you what's  
**[1:47:40-1:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:40):**  in their product and you have to do the research on your own.  
**[1:47:44-1:47:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:44):**  So I pull my hair out trying to figure out and I can read the label and unless they give  
**[1:47:50-1:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:50):**  me the species name, I really don't know what I'm buying until I try it.  
**[1:47:55-1:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:55):**  Even then, unless you got a lot of money and you want to have it tested, that can be very  
**[1:48:00-1:48:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:00):**  expensive.  
**[1:48:04-1:48:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:04):**  It's like the wild, wild west right now with inoculants.  
**[1:48:08-1:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:08):**  It really is.  
**[1:48:09-1:48:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:09):**  But a couple things you can do is some of these inoculants you can do yourself.  
**[1:48:15-1:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:15):**  You can make them yourself.  
**[1:48:16-1:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:16):**  So I'll give you an example.  
**[1:48:17-1:48:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:17):**  A couple years ago, I went out and I really was researching mycorrhizae.  
**[1:48:24-1:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:24):**  So I found out that there was a recipe for making your own mycorrhizae.  
**[1:48:28-1:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:28):**  I went out and got eight virgin soils, brought back about a barrel of each, mixed them all  
**[1:48:34-1:48:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:34):**  up and then put them in this medium.  
**[1:48:37-1:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:37):**  I had about a 16 foot by 12 foot area that I made my own little mixture, put this in  
**[1:48:45-1:48:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:45):**  there and started growing my own mycorrhizae and then growing oats and sorghum, sedan and  
**[1:48:51-1:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:51):**  some vegetables in there.  
**[1:48:53-1:48:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:53):**  After about two, three years, I got the inoculant level pretty high and then you can broadcast  
**[1:48:58-1:48:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:58):**  that on your own fields.  
**[1:48:59-1:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:59):**  Now, you can't sell it because in order to sell it, you'd have to sterilize it and that  
**[1:49:03-1:49:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:03):**  kind of defeats the purpose, but you can do this on your own.  
**[1:49:07-1:49:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:07):**  You can do that.  
**[1:49:08-1:49:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:08):**  The other thing you can do is with the worms, there's what we call David Johnson is doing  
**[1:49:13-1:49:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:13):**  the static compost and he's finding out that he's doing that and getting really good levels  
**[1:49:20-1:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:20):**  of healthy bacteria and different fungi in the soil, not the mycorrhizae, but other fungi  
**[1:49:27-1:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:27):**  and getting really good results with that.  
**[1:49:28-1:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:28):**  So I actually think that maybe rather than buying a lot of these things, maybe we ought  
**[1:49:32-1:49:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:32):**  to be looking at trying to grow things on our own.  
**[1:49:35-1:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:35):**  I totally agree with that.  
**[1:49:37-1:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:37):**  Companies don't like that.  
**[1:49:38-1:49:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:38):**  Yeah, yeah.  
**[1:49:39-1:49:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:39):**  It's a lot easier.  
**[1:49:40-1:49:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:40):**  I mean, I shouldn't say it's easier.  
**[1:49:41-1:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:41):**  It's actually a little more hard.  
**[1:49:43-1:49:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:43):**  There's a lot of labor involved, but if you have a low budget, you can do these things

**[1:49:49-1:49:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:49):**  I'm experimenting with the worm compost right now and doing some things and they are finding  
**[1:49:55-1:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:55):**  out.  
**[1:49:56-1:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:56):**  I think these worms are just little inoculators.  
**[1:49:59-1:50:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:59):**  They've got all these different species of bacteria that they're inoculating the compost  
**[1:50:04-1:50:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:04):**  with and it's not only, you know, as I look at my worm piles, I'm not only finding worms,  
**[1:50:09-1:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:09):**  guess what else?  
**[1:50:10-1:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:10):**  There's all kinds of pill bugs and spiders and every critter imaginable.  
**[1:50:15-1:50:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:15):**  Matter of fact, the other day I was putting a little extra water on my compost pile and  
**[1:50:19-1:50:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:19):**  out jumped a real little baby possum.  
**[1:50:22-1:50:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:22):**  And you know, most people would have said, well, let's just compost the possum.  
**[1:50:25-1:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:25):**  But I'll tell you what, I left him go.  
**[1:50:27-1:50:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:27):**  I put a board in there so he could get out.  
**[1:50:29-1:50:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:29):**  Why did I do that?  
**[1:50:30-1:50:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:30):**  Because possums are very good at eating ticks.  
**[1:50:33-1:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:33):**  And I have a lot of deer ticks around my farm and I thought, you know what, I'm gonna let  
**[1:50:38-1:50:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:38):**  that little sucker go because hopefully he's gonna eat up the deer ticks.  
**[1:50:42-1:50:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:42):**  I don't really like to be pulling off ticks all the time.  
**[1:50:45-1:50:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:45):**  So, you know, we got to learn to live with mother nature.  
**[1:50:48-1:50:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:48):**  Sure thing.  
**[1:50:49-1:50:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:49):**  Yeah.  
**[1:50:50-1:50:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:50):**  No, I love a lot of the suggestions, insight you've brought in this episode.  
**[1:50:54-1:50:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:54):**  Is there anything you'd like to leave the listener or viewer with, some final words  
**[1:50:59-1:51:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:59):**  to say, hey, if you're out there farming, give this a try or do this or anything else?  
**[1:51:06-1:51:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:06):**  Well, there's one thing that I found interesting.  
**[1:51:10-1:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:10):**  I probably should have added it on the other one.  
**[1:51:13-1:51:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:13):**  But, you know, on nitrogen, we know that compacted soils hurts us with denitrification.  
**[1:51:22-1:51:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:22):**  Okay.  
**[1:51:23-1:51:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:23):**  So we're losing 60 to 80% of our nitrogen from the soil in the Midwest from denitrification.  
**[1:51:30-1:51:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:30):**  Okay.  
**[1:51:31-1:51:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:31):**  Saturated soils, when we get those soils, they warm up, we can lose 60 to 80% of our  
**[1:51:38-1:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:38):**  nitrogen.  
**[1:51:39-1:51:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:39):**  That really hurts us on corn.  
**[1:51:40-1:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:40):**  Well, you know, I got to thinking about that and I was doing some research and does compassion  
**[1:51:46-1:51:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:46):**  have an impact on phosphorus?  
**[1:51:48-1:51:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:48):**  Does it have an impact on potassium?  
**[1:51:50-1:51:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:50):**  Well, I got to looking at it and I've done some research on phosphorus and we're finding  
**[1:51:56-1:52:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:56):**  out that under saturated soil conditions, phosphorus becomes more soluble and it flows  
**[1:52:02-1:52:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:02):**  with the water under very saturated soil conditions.  
**[1:52:06-1:52:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:06):**  And that's due to the fact that a lot of soils are high in iron and under saturated soil  
**[1:52:12-1:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:12):**  conditions, iron releases phosphorus.  
**[1:52:15-1:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:15):**  So let's think about this for a minute.  
**[1:52:17-1:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:17):**  As your organic matter levels go down, you have to use aluminum, iron and calcium to  
**[1:52:24-1:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:24):**  tie up your phosphorus.  
**[1:52:26-1:52:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:26):**  One of the reasons that we have a lot of water quality problems in the Midwest and around  
**[1:52:30-1:52:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:30):**  the world is because we've lost a lot of the organic matter from our soils.  
**[1:52:35-1:52:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:35):**  The other thing that's happened is in the 1980s, we started the Clean Air Act.  
**[1:52:42-1:52:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:42):**  And what happened?  
**[1:52:43-1:52:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:43):**  We used to talk about acid rain.  
**[1:52:44-1:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:44):**  Nobody talks about acid rain anymore, but the pH of the water coming down was about  
**[1:52:49-1:52:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:49):**  four and a quarter.  
**[1:52:51-1:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:51):**  And over time, we've cleaned that up and it went to five and a quarter.  
**[1:52:55-1:52:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:55):**  And now it's at six and a quarter.  
**[1:52:57-1:52:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:57):**  Well, guess what?  
**[1:52:58-1:53:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:58):**  Under very acid conditions 20 years ago, we didn't have all this soluble reactive phosphorus  
**[1:53:04-1:53:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:04):**  in Lake Erie causing the harmful algae blooms, but we had acid rain, iron under those acid  
**[1:53:09-1:53:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:09):**  conditions when that rain would come down and hold on to that phosphorus very tightly.  
**[1:53:14-1:53:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:14):**  But now as we've lost organic matter, and we've got a lot of iron in our soils, and  
**[1:53:18-1:53:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:18):**  now the pH is two points higher, that's a factor of 100 times more alkaline.  
**[1:53:26-1:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:26):**  That means the iron is holding on to that phosphorus less tightly, and it's being lost.  
**[1:53:33-1:53:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:33):**  Well, what's that got to do with soil health?  
**[1:53:35-1:53:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:35):**  The factor is we don't have the organic matter.  
**[1:53:38-1:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:38):**  And a lot of people here are doing the vertical tillage.  
**[1:53:40-1:53:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:40):**  So what happens now is we got a compacted layer about an inch, two inches deep.  
**[1:53:45-1:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:45):**  When it rains, all the phosphorus is at the surface.  
**[1:53:48-1:53:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:48):**  And now it's either going to go right down a crack to our tile line, or it's going to  
**[1:53:51-1:53:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:51):**  flow off right into our soil.  
**[1:53:54-1:53:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:54):**  If we had the organic matter in a cover crop, we would get that to go down into the soil,  
**[1:53:59-1:54:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:59):**  and then the roots would take it up.  
**[1:54:01-1:54:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:01):**  What do roots absorb?  
**[1:54:03-1:54:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:03):**  Soluble nitrogen, soluble phosphorus.  
**[1:54:05-1:54:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:05):**  So now we see a relationship between soil compaction on nitrogen and phosphorus.  
**[1:54:11-1:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:11):**  Hmm, do you think there might be a relationship to potash or potassium?  
**[1:54:18-1:54:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:18):**  Interesting thing, we've done some research in Ohio, Steve Coleman, last three years we  
**[1:54:22-1:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:22):**  updated our fertility guide, and they were looking at potassium, and they said something  
**[1:54:27-1:54:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:27):**  strange is going on with potassium, we don't understand it.  
**[1:54:30-1:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:30):**  The last three years, they went out and they soil tested, and they had, let's just say,  
**[1:54:36-1:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:36):**  a level of potassium, and then they would fertilize it, and then they would test the  
**[1:54:41-1:54:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:41):**  soil again.  
**[1:54:42-1:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:42):**  So let's say you put on 100, 200 pounds of potassium fertilizer, what would you expect  
**[1:54:49-1:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:49):**  the soil test to do?  
**[1:54:50-1:54:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:50):**  Should it go up?  
**[1:54:51-1:54:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:51):**  Should it stay the same, or should it go down?  
**[1:54:53-1:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:53):**  It should go up, right?  
**[1:54:55-1:54:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:55):**  Every time it went down.  
**[1:54:57-1:54:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:57):**  They said, what's going on here?  
**[1:54:59-1:55:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:59):**  And I just happened, when Steve was talking about this, I was sitting in the back row,  
**[1:55:03-1:55:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:03):**  so I went up afterwards and I said, Steve, I said, did you apply that in the fall?  
**[1:55:08-1:55:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:08):**  Yes.  
**[1:55:09-1:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:09):**  I said, did you broadcast that?  
**[1:55:11-1:55:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:11):**  Well, yeah, Jim, you know, that's typically how we put on potassium.  
**[1:55:15-1:55:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:15):**  And I said, did you vertical till it in?  
**[1:55:18-1:55:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:18):**  And he said, yeah.  
**[1:55:20-1:55:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:20):**  I said, well, you know that under saturated soil conditions, when you vertical till that,  
**[1:55:25-1:55:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:25):**  and we've had three wet falls in a row, what happened is you get potassium induction.  
**[1:55:31-1:55:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:31):**  And he said, what's potassium induction?  
**[1:55:34-1:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:34):**  Well, with our clay soil particles, what happens is, potassium is a very small ion, and under  
**[1:55:40-1:55:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:40):**  compacted saturated soil conditions, the clay opens up, it swallows up the potassium.  
**[1:55:47-1:55:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:47):**  That's why when they would soil test, and after they broadcast it, and they would work  
**[1:55:52-1:55:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:52):**  it into the ground, and the soil was saturated a little bit, it would tie up the potassium,  
**[1:55:57-1:56:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:57):**  and it would make the potassium unavailable.  
**[1:56:00-1:56:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:00):**  I went back and looked at a lot of our soil tests, and in very dry years, when we have  
**[1:56:07-1:56:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:07):**  more oxidation, we would find pretty good levels of potassium.  
**[1:56:11-1:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:11):**  I looked at a soil test that was taken three years later on these same fields, and it dropped  
**[1:56:17-1:56:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:17):**  by almost 200%.  
**[1:56:19-1:56:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:19):**  I mean, it went down that much, just because we've had saturated soils, it's tying up our  
**[1:56:25-1:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:25):**  potassium.  
**[1:56:26-1:56:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:26):**  And again, that goes back to the compaction and the lack of soil health.  
**[1:56:30-1:56:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:30):**  Once you get your soil in good shape, and you have soil health, you're going to have  
**[1:56:34-1:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:34):**  better nutrient availability, you're going to have healthier crops, more nutrient dense,  
**[1:56:40-1:56:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:40):**  and everything's going to work a little bit better, you're going to make more money, because  
**[1:56:44-1:56:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:44):**  you're going to have less input.  
**[1:56:45-1:56:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:45):**  So trying to get there, though, that's the hard part.  
**[1:56:48-1:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:48):**  And again, I would probably just tell people, you've got to start, you can't wait, don't  
**[1:56:55-1:56:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:55):**  wait too long, because it's not going to get any better.  
**[1:56:58-1:57:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:58):**  It's only going to get worse unless you take an active interest in it.  
**[1:57:02-1:57:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:02):**  Try to keep live roots out there year round as much as you can.  
**[1:57:05-1:57:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:05):**  And if people want to learn more about the work you're doing, where can they go?  
**[1:57:10-1:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:10):**  Yes.  
**[1:57:11-1:57:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:11):**  So let me tell you a little bit about myself.  
**[1:57:13-1:57:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:13):**  So I worked for Ohio State University for 24 years.  
**[1:57:17-1:57:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:17):**  I'm retired from there.  
**[1:57:19-1:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:19):**  Then I worked for the Natural Resource Conservation Service for three years as the soil health  
**[1:57:24-1:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:24):**  specialist.  
**[1:57:25-1:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:25):**  I more or less quit that job.  
**[1:57:29-1:57:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:29):**  And now I have my own company.  
**[1:57:31-1:57:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:31):**  It's called Horman Soil Health Services.  
**[1:57:33-1:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:33):**  I'm working on a number of grants, I do consulting, I sell some cover crop seed.  
**[1:57:39-1:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:39):**  I also sell some crimper rollers.  
**[1:57:42-1:57:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:42):**  I'm getting into that a little bit and doing a lot of different things.

**[1:58:30-1:58:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:30):**  And these COVID times, it's been a little bit difficult.  
**[1:58:32-1:58:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-02-JimHoorman-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:32):**  We're doing more webinars and staying home a little bit more.

### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  For the past 50 years, the Holy Grail and Agricultural Research has been getting nitrogen-fixing  
**[0:00:25-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  bacteria to form a relationship with non-legumes.  
**[0:00:32-0:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  Scientists have tried, explorers have looked, but the solution has never been found.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:38):**  It would be an amazing discovery if you could find that microbe-plant relationship and get  
**[0:00:43-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:43):**  it to work with agricultural crops.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  It would solve our fertilization problem because an industry that's fertilizer-intense could  
**[0:00:53-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:53):**  switch fossil-fuel-based nitrogen to something naturally occurring.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  But as I said to start this, it's the Holy Grail that's never been found.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  That's where synthetic biology comes in.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  Synthetic biology is a form of science that involves engineering microbes to perform functions  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:12):**  that they normally wouldn't do.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  And today I'm talking to the CEO of a company who's using synthetic biology to solve the  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  world's fertilization problem.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:23):**  In this episode of In Search of Soil, I'm joined by CEO of JOINbio, Mike Milley.  
**[0:01:29-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:29):**  JOIN's a unique company.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  They're using synthetic biology to engineer beneficial microbes to give growers the same  
**[0:01:35-0:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  or better optimized solutions that traits or chemicals do.  
**[0:01:40-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:40):**  They're seeking to reduce chemical use and possibly even replace it in the future using  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  microbe-plant relationships.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  Today's episode is a true glimpse into the future.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:53):**  And while you may or may not agree with synthetic biology, I think this episode will really  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  help you understand the complex systems that are occurring naturally within our soils.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:04):**  So let's get a glimpse into that future at SciFi Today with CEO of JOINbio, Mike Milley.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:12):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  So Mike, thanks for taking the time to join me today.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  You're currently CEO of the company JOINbio, and it's a really interesting company.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:24):**  At the core of it, what is JOIN setting out to do?  
**[0:02:29-0:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:29):**  I'd say our core mission is to answer a question that is, from our perspective, very important  
**[0:02:38-0:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:38):**  to agricultural innovation.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:41):**  And that is, can you take beneficial microbes and using the advanced technologies of synthetic  
**[0:02:49-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:49):**  biology, can you engineer those microbes in an optimized way so that they're delivering  
**[0:02:57-0:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  solutions to growers that have the same performance and the same consistency as traits and chemicals  
**[0:03:06-0:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  do?  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:07):**  And we're just trying to answer that question, can you do that?  
**[0:03:12-0:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  Can you actually engineer that beneficial microbe so that it provides performance that  
**[0:03:20-0:03:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:20):**  is unprecedented from a microbial solution perspective?  
**[0:03:24-0:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:24):**  When you think about that question and even asking that question, how possible is it?  
**[0:03:31-0:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:31):**  Obviously, you guys must think it's possible if you have a company setting out to do it.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:35):**  Is this like a 10 out of 10, extremely hard problem to crack?  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  We wouldn't be there now without the technology we have, or maybe we even need more technology  
**[0:03:45-0:03:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  to get there, or is it more like a five?  
**[0:03:48-0:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:48):**  It's doable with the tech we have, the knowledge we have, but there's just a lot of work that's  
**[0:03:52-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  going to have to go into making it happen.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  How hard is this to actually achieve?  
**[0:03:58-0:04:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  So I think there's a couple of ways to look at it.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:00):**  I think when we were proposing this company slash concept inside of Bayer almost three,  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:08):**  three and a half years ago, it was referred to as a moonshot.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  So it wasn't a Mars shot, but it also wasn't going across country.  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  So we talked about it as a moonshot, and this was fairly specific to our nitrogen fixation  
**[0:04:27-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:27):**  project.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  So is it difficult?  
**[0:04:31-0:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:31):**  Yes.  
**[0:04:32-0:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:32):**  There's really a couple big hurdles that you have to get over.  
**[0:04:37-0:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:37):**  One is that historically, synthetic biology has been used and has been done in a contained  
**[0:04:44-0:04:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:44):**  environment.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:46):**  And those microbes that are engineered in that contained environment are engineered  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  to produce a product, produce a metabolite, produce a fragrance, produce a specialty chemical  
**[0:04:56-0:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  that's then isolated away.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:58):**  And everything that happens is inside that container, right, with that engineered microbe.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  So that's done.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:05):**  What we need to do is engineer that microbe and grow it up.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:09):**  But it has to function in the field.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  It has to function on a seed.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  It has to function for a grower out in the environment.  
**[0:05:17-0:05:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:17):**  And so that means we have to find a whole new set of chassis or host microbes that have  
**[0:05:23-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:23):**  very different properties than E. coli or yeast or some of the traditional synthetic  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  biology hosts that are used.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  So that's one big hurdle.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:33):**  Can you find those hosts or chassis?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  And will they go out and survive in the field?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:39):**  Will they go out and colonize the plant as the delivery vehicle, right?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:43):**  The second piece is on a totally different scale or perspective is if you do that, and  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:51):**  they work really well, can you get them registered?  
**[0:05:55-0:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  And what's the consumer acceptance of a GMO or an engineered microbe?  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:00):**  Can you get over that hurdle?  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  We believe the answer to that is a strong yes.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:06):**  We believe it's connected directly to benefit.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:10):**  So that if we provide a solution to something as critical as reducing fertilizer levels  
**[0:06:17-0:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:17):**  with cereal crops, or if we could provide a new solution for Asian soybean rust or citrus  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:25):**  greening, some of these big problems in ag, we believe people will give it a chance.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  And then it's just a question of can we develop the safety data packages that support being  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:38):**  able to use these products in the environment?  
**[0:06:42-0:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:42):**  So these are big hurdles, if you will, or reasons why somebody like Bayer would probably  
**[0:06:50-0:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:50):**  not take this on in their internal crop science.  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:54):**  It's too risky, right?  
**[0:06:56-0:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  And that's why they set up the joint venture with Ginkgo and are doing this.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:01):**  We've been funded to do this as an independent company because we can take more risk and  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  do it at arm's length.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  We can be more entrepreneurial if we're successful, then one of the folks that we would go back  
**[0:07:14-0:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:14):**  to with that solution is Bayer.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:16):**  So it's a very cool model from their perspective.  
**[0:07:20-0:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:20):**  And it's a really creative way for Bayer to drive innovation for transformative but high  
**[0:07:27-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:27):**  risk projects versus doing it internally where the R&D has to be.  
**[0:07:35-0:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  I would just say it has to have a higher probability of success or has to have poor hurdles.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:41):**  When you think about that first problem that you brought up, you have to create a microbe  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:45):**  that can survive outside of the lab.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:47):**  It has to survive in the wild.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  Is there an analogy of that out there?  
**[0:07:52-0:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:52):**  Not necessarily an ag, but anywhere where science is engineering microbes that are surviving  
**[0:07:59-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  in the wild to perform a function that they weren't naturally derived to do?  
**[0:08:06-0:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  I would say that we're really just on the cusp of looking at that.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:12):**  So I think we're clearly driving that question or driving that from an agricultural perspective.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  There are people who are looking at it in terms of the human gut microbiome and potential  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  solutions there.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  There's people that are looking at it from an animal health perspective.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  There's people who are going to look at it in the context of bioremediation.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  So can you take a microbe that already is pretty good at chewing up oil from an oil  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  spill and can you engineer it so that it's 10 times or 100 times more effective?  
**[0:08:50-0:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  Or can you engineer a microbe so that it can bioremediate heavy metals in this type?  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:56):**  So yeah, I think we're at such an early stage.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  And I think a lot of this, it's interesting if you go back over the last five, six years  
**[0:09:07-0:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:07):**  and look at what scientific topics have been the most published, have had the most articles.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:17):**  Number one is CRISPR-Cas, right?  
**[0:09:20-0:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  Hands down.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:21):**  Number two is the microbiome.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  And this whole concept of understanding the microbiome, its relationship to human health,  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:29):**  its relationship to animal health, and in our case, its relationship to plant health  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  and soil health and the plant microbiome and the soil microbiome, just understanding how  
**[0:09:40-0:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  integral these microbes are to the everyday health and production and longevity of these  
**[0:09:50-0:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:50):**  plants.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:51):**  This is a whole new area.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:52):**  People are just starting to understand this and it's us, it's exciting to see not only  
**[0:09:57-0:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  is on the plant side, but look at the amount of effort that's going on on say the human  
**[0:10:02-0:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:02):**  side, recognizing the human microbiome and its role in a lot of different diseases and  
**[0:10:08-0:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:08):**  human health.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:12):**  In terms of difficulty and this moonshot, the too risky for Bayer to take on, how much  
**[0:10:19-0:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  of it is it actually being hard and how much of it is our understanding or lack of understanding  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:28):**  of microbiology?  
**[0:10:30-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:30):**  I hear this a lot and I don't know if it's true and you can tell me, I mean, you're in  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  the field that a lot of things when it gets into soil microbiology, we don't understand  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:39):**  very much of how those things function down there in the soil.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:44):**  And I'm sure it's the same in the human gut.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  Is that accurate and is that we're trying to build off of a non-robust knowledge base  
**[0:10:53-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:53):**  going forward?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  Is that part of the problem or is this just hard to begin with?  
**[0:10:57-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:57):**  But we know enough at the foundation, it's just hard.  
**[0:11:01-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  I think it's hard for two reasons.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  One is I think the complexity can be overwhelming.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  If you take a tablespoon of soil, there's like 4 billion microbes in there.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  So the sheer complexity of the microbiome, whether it's on the human skin, whether it's  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:25):**  in a human gut, whether it's on a plant or whether it's in a tablespoon of soil, there's  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  just a complexity there that at this stage is somewhat overwhelming.  
**[0:11:36-0:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:36):**  What has made it suddenly approachable, if you will, are the explosion of sequencing  
**[0:11:44-0:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:44):**  and genomic tools in a high throughput way, along with the software and the algorithms  
**[0:11:50-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:50):**  to process all that information that are emerging from the synthetic biology field.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  And so even though there might be a million or a billion of these, our ability to sort  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:01):**  out and look at these is starting to emerge.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:06):**  But it's absolutely true that we're just at the very, just because of the sheer complexity  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  of it, we're at the very tip of the iceberg of trying to understand it, very early stages.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  Now, if you isolate and take a single microbe, so you reduce, you take the complexity from  
**[0:12:28-0:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  what's in a soil sample to let's isolate a single microbe, now you've got something that's  
**[0:12:34-0:12:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:34):**  actually fairly easy to work with from an engineering perspective.  
**[0:12:38-0:12:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:38):**  Easier to work with than a plant, much easier to work with than an animal or a human from  
**[0:12:43-0:12:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:43):**  an engineering.  
**[0:12:44-0:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:44):**  So understanding pathways, introducing genes or adjusting pathways.  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:50):**  So optimizing, optimizing certain aspects of that microbe for a specific purpose at  
**[0:12:56-0:13:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  the individual microbe level, it suddenly has become doable, if you will.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:03):**  So I think it's that contrast between incredible complexity out there in the soil, but if you  
**[0:13:10-0:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:10):**  get to that single microbe, you actually have something that today's genomic tools can actually  
**[0:13:15-0:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:15):**  work with and sequence and understand fairly effectively.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:19):**  So when you set out about to do this and you isolate the single microbe, there's two potential  
**[0:13:24-0:13:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  paths I see here is one, you look for a microbe that can survive out in the wild and is receptive  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:33):**  to taking on the traits that you want it to take on.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  In this case, it's nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:38):**  So you take that existing microbe and you build nitrogen fixation onto it.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  Another pathway could be you take a nitrogen fixing microbe, Rhizobia, and instead of having  
**[0:13:49-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:49):**  it bond with just certain plants, you now essentially open up its filter or its lens  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  and it can now bond with other plants that aren't just legumes.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:01):**  Is there one path that is more likely or is there a third path that I'm not seeing?  
**[0:14:06-0:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  No, I think in the case of the nitrogen fixation, I think in simple terms, those are sort of  
**[0:14:13-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13):**  the two paths that you have.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  If you think about what the characteristics are of what we call a chassis or host microbe,  
**[0:14:24-0:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:24):**  some of the ones you mentioned, it needs to be stable in the environment.  
**[0:14:28-0:14:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:28):**  It needs to be tractable or easily engineered.  
**[0:14:32-0:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:32):**  But the other critical one for us is it needs to colonize and associate with the plant.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:39):**  And so if you think about the ideal nitrogen fixation product for corn, it would be applied  
**[0:14:49-0:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:49):**  to the corn as a seed treatment.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:53):**  That's by far the most effective way to apply a new solution to a crop like that, where  
**[0:14:59-0:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  you've already got a lot of the farmer has already invested heavily in acquiring that  
**[0:15:07-0:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:07):**  corn seed from either Bayer or Cortella, two of them, right?  
**[0:15:11-0:15:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:11):**  But you get it and it's already been optimized from a genetic standpoint, from a breeding,  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  hybrid corn breeding standpoint.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  And then if you can put a seed treatment on it that provides additional benefit, in this  
**[0:15:23-0:15:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:23):**  case, the nitrogen fixing microbe, if you can put it on, when that grower goes to plant  
**[0:15:30-0:15:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:30):**  the corn, she's going to do that microbe, that nitrogen fixation solution is already  
**[0:15:37-0:15:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:37):**  on the seed.  
**[0:15:38-0:15:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:38):**  Now what that microbe has to do then is as that seed germinates, as it goes into the  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:45):**  soil and as it germinates, ideally you want a microbe that associates with the entire  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  corn plant through its entire life cycle, right?  
**[0:15:55-0:16:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:55):**  And it will grow and populate that plant, colonize it in a symbiotic way.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:02):**  So you might say, well, are there microbes that do that?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:04):**  And the answer is absolutely, right?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  There are microbes who form symbiotic relationships and they get something that they need from  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  the corn and vice versa, right?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:14):**  And that microbe can be providing things signaling or providing things back to the corn plant.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:19):**  So what we're looking for, one of the things we're looking for ideally is sort of a combination  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:25):**  of what you mentioned, which is start with some microbes that already have some of the  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  nitrogen fixing machinery in them.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  Make some adjustments to it.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:38):**  Because one of the things that happens in those microbes is that they will typically,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  they have mechanisms that when there's plenty of nitrogen around, they shut off.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  And so what you want that nitrogen fixing microbe to do is not shut off its nitrogen  
**[0:16:53-0:16:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  fixation, but actually ramp it up.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:55):**  And so you actually have to do some engineering to make that happen.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  The other part of this, and I mentioned life cycle of the corn.  
**[0:17:04-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:04):**  If you're a corn grower, the biggest benefit of a product like this, of a new solution  
**[0:17:10-0:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:10):**  like this would be if it can deliver the nitrogen in the second half of its life cycle.  
**[0:17:18-0:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:18):**  Because that's when it takes up most of its, if you think about a corn, the corn plant,  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:22):**  it's growing up, it's in that second half of its growth period that it's actually producing  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  the corn.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:30):**  And that's when it uses about 78, it needs about 70 to 80% of its nitrogen.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:35):**  However, if you think about, well, when did the fertilizer get applied?  
**[0:17:39-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:39):**  Way back before when it was planted, right?  
**[0:17:42-0:17:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  So that's why they have to put on, that's one reason why the levels of synthetic fertilizer  
**[0:17:47-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:47):**  are as high as they are, because they have to try to last in the soil through that whole  
**[0:17:52-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  growing season.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:53):**  So if we can get a microbe that fixes the nitrogen, colonizes the corn plant via a seed  
**[0:18:01-0:18:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  treatment, right?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:03):**  Then, and it goes through the lifetime, it can be fixing and delivering nitrogen in that  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:09):**  second half of the growth cycle.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:12):**  And that's ideal for the grower because now he doesn't have to rely on putting so much  
**[0:18:17-0:18:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  on in the beginning and he doesn't have to worry about having to go back out if he needs  
**[0:18:22-0:18:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:22):**  to and reapplying nitrogen to make sure he's got the right amount of nutrient there to  
**[0:18:28-0:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:28):**  optimize his yield or his productivity per acre.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:33):**  And I just from doing reading the nitrogen fixation process in a plant, it's very carbon  
**[0:18:39-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:39):**  intensive in order to do that.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  Given that, do you have to modify the carbon flow of a corn plant so it feeds those microbes  
**[0:18:51-0:18:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:51):**  what they need to do that conversion?  
**[0:18:54-0:18:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:54):**  I don't think you can get just a free lunch, right, where they fix nitrogen, they're not  
**[0:18:57-0:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:57):**  taking anything back.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  So do you need to change something within the corn to now deliver surplus carbon in  
**[0:19:05-0:19:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:05):**  the form of sugars to really get that pump going?  
**[0:19:09-0:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:09):**  I think that's a good question.  
**[0:19:11-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:11):**  I don't, to be honest, I don't think we know exactly how it's going to work in a successful,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  so one of the things we're looking at is exactly that.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  Are there microbes that are out there that have that relationship already in place or  
**[0:19:27-0:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:27):**  that in theory can form that symbiotic relationship with the corn?  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:33):**  So part of the studies and assays that we do is identifying what we call endophytic  
**[0:19:41-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:41):**  bacteria, ones that are inside, will exist inside the plant and not just on the roots  
**[0:19:48-0:19:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  or not just in the soil, but can they actually populate the entire plant that actually will  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:55):**  be getting nutrients or getting something beneficial from that corn plant, right, such  
**[0:20:01-0:20:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:01):**  that they're actually incented or they actually do colonize over an extended period of weeks  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:09):**  and even a couple of months.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  That's what we're looking for.  
**[0:20:13-0:20:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:13):**  And so for us, because this is new, because people haven't really gone out there and tried  
**[0:20:18-0:20:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:18):**  to find chassis or hosts that do the colonization and also can be reasonably engineered in the  
**[0:20:27-0:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:27):**  ground, a big part of our initial work is identifying as many of these potential hosts  
**[0:20:34-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:34):**  or chassis as we can.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  If we zoom out here and we just think microbiology or just general biology, is there a reason  
**[0:20:44-0:20:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:44):**  why nitrogen-fixing bacteria form relationships with legumes but they don't with other plants?  
**[0:20:52-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:52):**  In other words, why did some plants evolve not to have this relationship?  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  What I've heard, I'm not an expert in this area of plant evolution, but my understanding  
**[0:21:09-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:09):**  is that in the case of say soybeans or peanuts and some of the legumes that do fix nitrogen  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:17):**  and actually fix it with these rhizobia microbes, they actually fix it with the nodules in their  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  roots at a level where they almost don't need fertilizer.  
**[0:21:26-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:26):**  As a matter of fact, people will actually rotate soybeans with corn because after growing  
**[0:21:32-0:21:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  soybeans for a year, there's actually more nitrogen in the soil than before you planted  
**[0:21:39-0:21:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  it.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:40):**  They actually are nitrogen-positive, if you will.  
**[0:21:43-0:21:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:43):**  Where in this whole thing is soybeans were evolving, they must have been in an environment  
**[0:21:48-0:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:48):**  that was nitrogen-poor.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:51):**  It was an evolutionary thing where the ones that actually started to develop these nodules  
**[0:21:56-0:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:56):**  and these nitrogen-fixing microbes would outcompete and would eventually be the norm, if you will,  
**[0:22:06-0:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:06):**  versus soybeans that were in a soybean environment where you had depleted nitrogen.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:12):**  You didn't have enough nitrogen there.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:15):**  Evolution is going to favor the ones that can actually fix the nitrogen, actually evolve  
**[0:22:21-0:22:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  that way.  
**[0:22:22-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:22):**  For whatever reason, if you think about corn, if you go back to the Haber-Bosch reaction  
**[0:22:28-0:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  in the early 1900s, when they came up with the synthetic fertilizer, as soon as that  
**[0:22:34-0:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:34):**  started being applied routinely in US ag, for example, the need for nitrogen was being  
**[0:22:42-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  totally supplied synthetically.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  There was no driver, there was no pressure, evolutionary pressure or environmental pressure  
**[0:22:51-0:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:51):**  for microbes to do it.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:53):**  Matter of fact, it was actually removed in that process.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:56):**  So when you look at corn and wheat and some of these cereals, for some reason, they never  
**[0:23:02-0:23:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:02):**  had that, they never had the opportunity to evolve with the nitrogen-fixing microbe.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:10):**  There was never environmental pressure to drive that.  
**[0:23:13-0:23:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:13):**  And so, A, if you look at the corn we have today, there are no known, there is no magic  
**[0:23:19-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:19):**  microbe that you can put on as a seed treatment.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  There's no magic microbe you can associate with corn that will deliver nitrogen, will  
**[0:23:27-0:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:27):**  fix nitrogen from the air and deliver it to the plant like the microbes that are in the  
**[0:23:33-0:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:33):**  soybeans or peanuts or legumes in general.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:37):**  So in this moonshot, is the moon landing?  
**[0:23:41-0:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:41):**  You have a microbe that can associate with corn, colonize with corn and 100% replace  
**[0:23:49-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:49):**  all of the external fertilization needs for that corn plant?  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  No.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  I think I'd say no, that's not, for us, I would define the moon landing as us having  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:04):**  a seed treatment or inferal product that a grower can put out there and he can reduce  
**[0:24:11-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:11):**  his synthetic fertilizer use 40 to 50% and get the same yield or higher yield.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  So it's more of a Prius type approach as opposed to a Tesla.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:25):**  So we, at this point, we're not trying to go all the way to replace it 100%.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  We're not even sure that that's practical, but we think it would be transformative to  
**[0:24:35-0:24:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:35):**  agriculture to be able to show that you could reduce it 40 to 50%.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:40):**  That's a huge step.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:41):**  Now, where you go from there, we'll know better in three or four years, right?  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  As the whole field sort of evolves and as people make progress.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:50):**  But for us, the moon landing would be 40, 50% reduction in the input while maintaining  
**[0:24:58-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:58):**  the exact same yield or higher yield than what they're getting if they did a full 100%  
**[0:25:06-0:25:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  input of the synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:09):**  You think about what's going on now out there with CRISPR-Cas.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  I've talked to several people who are involved in the food space, the prepared food space  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  who are using that technology to do really amazing things.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  One thing you said I thought was really interesting was sometimes you can take these microbes  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:26):**  and tweak them to say, get that nitrogen production to really come in the second half of the corn's  
**[0:25:33-0:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:33):**  lifestyle.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:36):**  Is there any thought of looking at an existing legume, a soybean, that already has the fixation  
**[0:25:42-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  part, that's salt, and just really dialing up the nitrogen fixation.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  So it supplies, suddenly its roots are putting on 3X the nitrogen that it needs 300 times  
**[0:25:56-0:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:56):**  as much nitrogen as it needs.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:58):**  So when that plant dies off, it got enough nitrogen to grow itself, but there's a huge  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  abundance left in the ground for the next crop that follows it on.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  In this whole corn-soybean rotation that we have here in the US, a lot of farmers are  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  planting corn after soy.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:19):**  Those soy roots are already there, they just dissolve into the surface, those nutrients  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:23):**  become bioavailable.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:24):**  What about turning up the dial on current legumes to just produce more in an existing  
**[0:26:30-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:30):**  rotation?  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  It's a really interesting question.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:37):**  In theory, it should be possible.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:39):**  I would say that from our perspective, we focused our initial technical proof of concept  
**[0:26:48-0:26:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  and our initial research on working specifically with the corn itself and trying to associate  
**[0:26:56-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:56):**  some of that nitrogen fixation with the corn.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  However, I would say if you could think about it, like you've said, if you could increase  
**[0:27:07-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  the amount of nitrogen production from a soybean, if you could increase it by 10 or 100x and  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  you leave behind in a rotational world, if you leave behind that much more, it's going  
**[0:27:23-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:23):**  to be complementary to, or that's going to be an incremental benefit to what you can  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  do to reduce the synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  I would say that's one of those ideas we have that we would look at in phase two or phase  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  three of our work.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  We haven't done anything to date to explore it, I would just say that.  
**[0:27:50-0:27:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:50):**  But I think in theory, it's absolutely possible.  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:55):**  The whole point of using these engineering techniques is you can take something very  
**[0:27:59-0:28:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:59):**  targeted, and if you understand the pathways and the genes and what they're doing, there's  
**[0:28:05-0:28:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:05):**  ways that you can optimize them for a very particular purpose, which may not happen in  
**[0:28:13-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:13):**  nature for 100 million years, but with the tools we have by making these changes, you  
**[0:28:20-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:20):**  can suddenly make the change in a matter of months and years as opposed to waiting for  
**[0:28:28-0:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  evolutionary pressures to drive it.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  That's really accelerating evolution when you think about it, is the ability to go in  
**[0:28:38-0:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:38):**  there and have a very targeted output that you want, and then understanding the mechanics  
**[0:28:45-0:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:45):**  or the mechanisms of that microbe and tweaking it so that you focus all its energy or all  
**[0:28:51-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:51):**  of its overexpression on that targeted output that you want.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  Yeah, and it's being done everywhere.  
**[0:28:58-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  It's yogurt and a lot of other food products have this being done in wines.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  When you think about problem or challenge number two that you face, and that's public  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:09):**  acceptance of this, how much legitimate worry is there that this goes Jurassic Park?  
**[0:29:17-0:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:17):**  You suddenly introduce these microbes into the soil biome that can now colonize with  
**[0:29:25-0:29:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:25):**  non-legumes and there's four billion, some large amount of microbes in a tablespoon of  
**[0:29:33-0:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  soil that you throw off that whole balance that's evolved to be there.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:40):**  There's either unforeseen ripples or it creates some sort of trickle-down effect.  
**[0:29:47-0:29:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:47):**  How do you even think about when you drop that in the water where the ripples go, given  
**[0:29:54-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:54):**  that immense complexity?  
**[0:29:57-0:30:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  I think the honest answer is that you don't know until you can do the testing.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:06):**  I think it's an important question that we have to answer.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  When I was talking earlier about if there's a big enough benefit to a new technology,  
**[0:30:16-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:16):**  to something novel that people haven't had before, that's really what drives it.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:23):**  That's what gets you in the door.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:25):**  What actually gets you registered or what actually allows you to be a product is you're  
**[0:30:31-0:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:31):**  able to provide both regulatory agencies and the public with enough safety information  
**[0:30:39-0:30:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:39):**  that you can answer those types of questions.  
**[0:30:43-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:43):**  Obviously if we come up with a solution like that, one of the questions is going to be,  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  well, okay, how long is it around?  
**[0:30:50-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:50):**  What's the persistence?  
**[0:30:51-0:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  Does it stay in the soil or is it gone at the end of the season type thing?  
**[0:30:57-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  What impact, if any, is it having on any other microbes that are in there?  
**[0:31:04-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:04):**  At this point, we've worked with native microbes for quite some time.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  We've also done some work now with some of the engineered ones.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:16):**  We're compiling data that shows that those type of worst case effects or worst case outcomes,  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:25):**  that's not what's happening.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:26):**  That's not the reality with what's going on with the microbes.  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:30):**  You can't just presume that.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  You actually have to go out and do the testing and be able to answer the questions to the  
**[0:31:36-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:36):**  satisfaction of the regulatory folks and to a certain extent the consumer.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  If you think about ways that these microbes could play out in terms of lifestyle or life  
**[0:31:49-0:31:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:49):**  cycle, one could be you inoculate the seed at the time the seed goes into the ground  
**[0:31:55-0:31:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:55):**  or right before.  
**[0:31:56-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:56):**  It exists on the plant as long as the plant's alive.  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  Plant dies, microbe dies with it.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  I mean total death, not dormancy, doesn't sporulate or anything like that.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  The other way would be it's like a normal legume.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  When the plant itself dies, the microbes go dormant in the cycle and most dormant in the  
**[0:32:17-0:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:17):**  soil and they'll stay there until the next legumes are planted or until they just can't  
**[0:32:23-0:32:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  live any longer.  
**[0:32:24-0:32:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:24):**  Would there be a desired outcome here when you're looking at colonizing some of these  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:28):**  non-legumes like corn?  
**[0:32:30-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:30):**  Is it associating with the plant while it's alive and then it's gone?  
**[0:32:35-0:32:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  I'm thinking from a farmer's standpoint, you'd want these in the soil, you inoculate and  
**[0:32:40-0:32:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:40):**  you probably do it every time just to be safe, but why not have them survive in the soil  
**[0:32:45-0:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  if they could?  
**[0:32:47-0:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:47):**  Yeah I think it's, obviously you can look at it from both perspectives.  
**[0:32:55-0:32:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:55):**  If you're investing money in developing a new product, ideally if you're the company  
**[0:32:59-0:33:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:59):**  producing the product, you want the grower to buy it every year.  
**[0:33:04-0:33:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  The economics of it, but in this case I don't think it's black and white.  
**[0:33:08-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:08):**  I think that with time, if we can find microbes that do tend to stay in the soil, and so next  
**[0:33:18-0:33:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  year when you come back, if you plant that corn, if there's a little extra there, it's  
**[0:33:22-0:33:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:22):**  an extra boost.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:23):**  With time, it carries on.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  I think that's only a positive because I think what the grower is going to be able to do  
**[0:33:32-0:33:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  then is go from a 40 or 50% reduction, maybe they can go to 60, maybe they go to 70.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:38):**  You just keep incrementally ratcheting it up.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:41):**  To me, I think you've got to remember that what's the problem you're trying to solve

**[0:33:49-0:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  Where does the benefit of this come from?  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:52):**  A big part of it is from the fact that the synthetic fertilizers, while absolutely critical

**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:36):**  These are pretty well publicized environmental concerns.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:42):**  If you just keep doing it, it's not environmentally sustainable.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:46):**  Yet today, you can't vilify it because today, it's absolutely crucial to the production

**[0:35:03-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:03):**  to reduce that synthetic fertilizer use to the smallest number we can.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  It both brings down the greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time, we'll have a significant  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:14):**  reduction in the runoff.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  Part of this also is you have to design this microbe to work in a synthetic fertilizer

**[0:35:48-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:50):**  That's one of the engineering pieces that us and a few others are looking at is what  
**[0:35:56-0:36:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  can you turn off or turn on to ensure that that microbe is not only fixing nitrogen,  
**[0:36:05-0:36:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:05):**  but also delivering it to the plant regardless of the environment.  
**[0:36:11-0:36:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  You want it to do it in a nitrogen rich environment so that it's not turning off.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:17):**  That's exactly one of the sets of engineering approaches that we're taking.  
**[0:36:24-0:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:24):**  When you think about the science of this, if you put rhizobia that associate with legumes

**[0:36:38-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:38):**  Is it just like they just don't communicate?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  They're just there both next to each other and there's no reaching out by quote either  
**[0:36:48-0:36:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:48):**  party to try and form a relationship?  
**[0:36:52-0:36:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:52):**  What triggers that?  
**[0:36:53-0:36:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:53):**  Do you have any idea in terms of your expertise is there a chemical signal that's-  
**[0:36:57-0:36:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:57):**  Yeah, no, it's an interesting question.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:59):**  I personally don't.  
**[0:37:00-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  I know people have done some work and that association and that is not there.  
**[0:37:14-0:37:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  Because of the type of microbe that rhizobia is, it also its stability is totally dependent  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:21):**  on that association with the soy root and the dynamics that that evolved with.  
**[0:37:26-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:26):**  You just don't have that whole infrastructure, if you will, that it has with a corn plant.  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  So as simple as it seems, just transplant it.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:42):**  The attempts to do that work that's been done on that, it doesn't work.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  What I don't personally know is the exact physiological reasons that are preventing  
**[0:37:51-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:51):**  that or why that doesn't happen.  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  So I'm imagining this corn is your control.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  That's where you start with, okay, we have this corn plant, we're not changing this.  
**[0:38:01-0:38:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  We got to get a microbe to go over and talk to this.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:08):**  What's there?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  What has to happen there for the microbe that you're designing to form that relationship  
**[0:38:16-0:38:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:16):**  with the corn?  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:17):**  Is it the microbe picks up on a chemical signal the corn sends out?  
**[0:38:22-0:38:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:22):**  What I'm trying to get at is how does the microbe in the corn meet?  
**[0:38:26-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:26):**  How do they know, hey, there's something good here.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  We have to come together.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:30):**  Is it exudates?  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:32):**  What brings them together or allows the corn plant to get the microbe to colonize it, to  
**[0:38:39-0:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:39):**  come inside of it?  
**[0:38:43-0:38:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:43):**  So the short answer is it's related to signaling and to nutrients and metabolites that go back  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:53):**  and forth between the two that provide that attraction, whether it's a nutritional attraction,  
**[0:38:59-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:59):**  a signaling attraction, and going in both ways.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  As we go all the way back to the beginning of our talk, the complexity out there, the  
**[0:39:11-0:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:11):**  billions of microbes out there, we're a long way from understanding exactly and knowing  
**[0:39:17-0:39:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:17):**  exactly what microbes associate the best and communicate the best and have the best relationship  
**[0:39:24-0:39:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  with corn.  
**[0:39:26-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:26):**  What people are doing is going out and isolating microbes from corn plants in different geographies  
**[0:39:33-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  and trying to classify into fitness four formals.  
**[0:39:38-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:38):**  By microbes that specifically associate with the corn as a starting point.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  Because you've rather than try to, today, that would be a very difficult thing to engineer  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:51):**  in.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  We don't understand enough about exactly what all those dynamics are.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  But if we can start with a chassis or host that has already evolved, already has the  
**[0:40:02-0:40:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  properties that associate with that corn or that wheat plant, that's a great starting  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:08):**  point.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:09):**  And that's the power of what we're trying to do is find a chassis or host out there  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  that already has that built in.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  And then can we engineer, can we optimize it, or can we engineer it to significantly  
**[0:40:25-0:40:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:25):**  increase the amount of nitrogen not only that it's fixing, but also that it's delivering  
**[0:40:30-0:40:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:30):**  to the corn plant?  
**[0:40:31-0:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:32):**  How much do lab conditions vary over the wild?  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37):**  In other words, if you modify certain traits of the bacteria, like you said, they could  
**[0:40:43-0:40:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:43):**  exist in that container that's a lab, but now you put it out into the wild, all of a  
**[0:40:48-0:40:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:48):**  sudden there's other microbes out there.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:49):**  It has to have defense mechanisms.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  It has to just be able to survive on its own while it performs these additional functions.  
**[0:40:57-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  How much of a challenge is that?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  It's huge.  
**[0:41:02-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:02):**  I think that's actually, I mean, I think it's one of the biggest hurdles.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:05):**  And I think if you look back, people have been working on biological solutions, microbes,  
**[0:41:13-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:13):**  microbial solutions, biological solutions for ag for 100 years, and really more recently  
**[0:41:21-0:41:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  for 30 or 40 years.  
**[0:41:24-0:41:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:24):**  And you sit there and say, wow, in a world where environmental sustainability is important,  
**[0:41:32-0:41:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:32):**  and in a world where clearly it seems like microbes should be one of the solutions for  
**[0:41:40-0:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:40):**  growers, why isn't the business bigger?  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:44):**  Why aren't there more biological solutions out there?  
**[0:41:48-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  And why is the industry today totally dominated by traits and chemistry?  
**[0:41:55-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  And the reason is simple, it's performance.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:01):**  And the biggest knock on natural microbial solutions is consistency.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  They don't perform with the same consistency that traits and chemicals do.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  And one of the reasons for that is because they are living organisms.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:18):**  The products themselves are living.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  They are microbes, and they are impacted by the environment.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:25):**  And so temperature and moisture and all the things that affect a living organism tend  
**[0:42:34-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:34):**  to, as well as just the environment that they're put in, will affect their performance.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  If you think about a chemical, for the most part, it doesn't really care.  
**[0:42:43-0:42:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:43):**  You spray that chemical out there, and it kills the bug or it kills the disease.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:47):**  If you put a trait into a plant, it's relatively unaffected by what temperature the soil is  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:58):**  or how much moisture there is.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:00):**  It's actually in there.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  And so those are the tools that the growers have become very comfortable with, and they've  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:05):**  become the standard from a performance standpoint.  
**[0:43:08-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:08):**  So how do you turn around, how do you take a microbe that is vulnerable or susceptible  
**[0:43:15-0:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  to these environmental conditions that isn't consistent, how do you get it so that it has  
**[0:43:21-0:43:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:21):**  the same level of performance as a chemical or a trait?  
**[0:43:26-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:26):**  And our belief is that you actually have to engineer or optimize that microbe and get  
**[0:43:32-0:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  it up above, get the performance up above the noise or the background that's there when  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:38):**  you have a natural microbe so that it is performing, even if the temperature goes down a little  
**[0:43:44-0:43:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:44):**  bit, or even if the moisture, all these things that might affect that microbe and its colonization,  
**[0:43:50-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:50):**  that you've now introduced it, it's now producing enough of the metabolite or it's producing  
**[0:43:56-0:44:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  enough of the signal or it's producing enough of the nitrogen that you are performing on  
**[0:44:02-0:44:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:02):**  a consistent basis.  
**[0:44:04-0:44:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:04):**  So it really speaks to, because we get that, why are you engineering?  
**[0:44:08-0:44:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:08):**  Why not just go find the microbe that goes and does this?  
**[0:44:12-0:44:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:12):**  And the answer is people have been running down that path for 30 years.  
**[0:44:18-0:44:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:18):**  And there's arguably not a single blockbuster.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:23):**  There's no biological product that comes close to the use, revenue, success, whatever, of  
**[0:44:32-0:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:32):**  traits and chemicals.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:34):**  They dominate.  
**[0:44:36-0:44:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:36):**  And it's our belief, our belief is that from an environmental sustainability perspective,  
**[0:44:43-0:44:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  and just in terms of providing growers with tools that they're going to need to address  
**[0:44:48-0:44:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:48):**  climate change and regulatory change and consumer demand changes and the whole food security  
**[0:44:56-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:56):**  piece, where are their new tools going to come from?  
**[0:45:01-0:45:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:01):**  Where's the innovation going to come from to allow them to withstand all these different  
**[0:45:06-0:45:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:06):**  adversity, all this adversity that's coming at them?  
**[0:45:10-0:45:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:10):**  And there will continue to be progress and solutions that come from traits.  
**[0:45:17-0:45:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:17):**  But the challenge there is you've got to do it one crop, pretty much one crop at a time.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:25):**  And by far, the one that's had the most investment in it is corn.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:28):**  By Pioneer and Monsanto and Albert.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:33):**  A little bit with soy.  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:35):**  But they're really just these big acre crops that have big returns that can justify a 10  
**[0:45:42-0:45:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:42):**  to 14 year development cycle.  
**[0:45:45-0:45:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:45):**  So you've got to have a big crop for it.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:51):**  But it's limited to just that.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  And then with chemicals, there's the number of new actives, the number of new modes of  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:59):**  action.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:00):**  All of that has slowed down significantly across herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides.  
**[0:46:07-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:07):**  And at the same time, the regulatory pressure on it and on all those chemicals has been  
**[0:46:15-0:46:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  ratcheted up dramatically.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:17):**  So the door is open for these biological solutions.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  The door is there.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:22):**  But if you're going to go through it, you've got to go through it with products that perform  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:30):**  close to or at the level that the existing products, that the chemicals and the trees  
**[0:46:35-0:46:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:35):**  do.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:36):**  That's really the real challenge from a scientific and from a scientific perspective.  
**[0:46:47-0:46:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:47):**  And is the thought that the biology can do that.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:50):**  It's just engineering the biology in a way that it can consistently do that.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:58):**  Like it's biologically possible.  
**[0:47:01-0:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:01):**  You guys are, amongst other companies, have to just make a solution to take the biology  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:06):**  and say, okay, it's going to work.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:08):**  We're going to make sure it works every single time as stated.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:11):**  Yep.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:12):**  It works every time.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:15):**  And there's also, you can get into the details of rate.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  What rate does it have to go out at?  
**[0:47:22-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:22):**  So that those growers can't be, and this is what I'm saying is, with a seed treatment,  
**[0:47:28-0:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  if you think about a seed treatment as a form of application, the amount of microbe you  
**[0:47:33-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:33):**  can put on that seed is limited.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  There's only so much space on a given seed for the seed treatment.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  So you've got to be able to have it be potent enough at some point.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:44):**  It has to be potent enough that it can work in those small amounts.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:49):**  The same thing if you go out and put it in the soil.  
**[0:47:53-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:53):**  They're only going to put out a certain amount.  
**[0:47:55-0:48:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:55):**  So you have to have, you also have to have a potency or an efficacy aspect to it, exactly  
**[0:48:02-0:48:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:02):**  how you described it.  
**[0:48:04-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:04):**  That microbe has been engineered for a very, very specific purpose, right?  
**[0:48:09-0:48:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  To maximize its production of a particular output or a particular metabolite to address  
**[0:48:17-0:48:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:17):**  the disease or address the pest, the insect, or in our case with biofertility, to address  
**[0:48:24-0:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:24):**  the nitrogen needs.  
**[0:48:26-0:48:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:26):**  Are you aware of any microbes being used in agriculture that were engineered and they  
**[0:48:36-0:48:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  go out there and use today and they survive in the wild, let alone forget making associations  
**[0:48:42-0:48:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:42):**  of plants, but are there biologicals being used that we currently make that they go out  
**[0:48:48-0:48:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:48):**  there, they're used no problem.  
**[0:48:49-0:48:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:49):**  So like the survivability problem could be conquered.  
**[0:48:53-0:48:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:53):**  Here's an example of it.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  The next step is, okay, now it's got to associate with another plant to perform its function,  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:59):**  but are there microbe products out there that are being used?  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  There's a few examples.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:05):**  I think the one I'm most familiar with when I was at Bayer was they had a seed treatment  
**[0:49:12-0:49:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:12):**  called Pancho-Votivo II.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:15):**  So the Votivo was a microbe that had in fact been engineered and it provided both the nematocytol,  
**[0:49:24-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:24):**  some level of the nematocytol activity, as well as sort of plant health, higher yield  
**[0:49:31-0:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:31):**  benefits to it.  
**[0:49:32-0:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:32):**  And so, and when we went to register that, we actually, the nice thing with it, it was  
**[0:49:38-0:49:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:38):**  a good example where we at that time, Bayer, we were able to go and register it via the  
**[0:49:46-0:49:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  States.  
**[0:49:47-0:49:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:47):**  So because it was more of a plant health type of an additive or a seed treatment, we were  
**[0:49:55-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:55):**  able to register it through the States specifically.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:59):**  And Bayer went to them and sat down with the state regulators, said, hey, it's engineered,  
**[0:50:04-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:04):**  here's what it is.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  And so it actually is a seed treatment that's used on a lot of the corn or can be used on  
**[0:50:10-0:50:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:10):**  the corn.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:11):**  So that's a real example.  
**[0:50:15-0:50:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  It's a little different.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:16):**  The engineering that was done on that's a little different, slightly, it's a little  
**[0:50:19-0:50:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:19):**  different than the approach that the joint's taking.  
**[0:50:22-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:22):**  But in fact, you ended up with a genetically modified microbe and it was registered and  
**[0:50:27-0:50:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  it is being used.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:28):**  So it's one example, but that's, there's very few, I mean, very, our approach to this and  
**[0:50:37-0:50:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  our joint venture with Ginkgo and having access to Ginkgo's synthetic biology tools and technology,  
**[0:50:43-0:50:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:43):**  this is really the first major attempt to do this in a big way, in a very directed way.  
**[0:50:50-0:50:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:50):**  So I think that those products are still to come.  
**[0:50:55-0:51:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:55):**  In terms of that petiva seed treatment, how was the efficacy of that compared to say,  
**[0:51:01-0:51:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:01):**  you know, just adding nitrogen fertilizer, if one of the targets was yield, how well  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:07):**  did the biological work in terms of boosting yield, you know, versus straight up untreated  
**[0:51:12-0:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:12):**  seed?  
**[0:51:13-0:51:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  I mean, was it huge?  
**[0:51:15-0:51:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:15):**  Like, is there a lot of potential here?  
**[0:51:18-0:51:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:18):**  So the petiva, it was, I would say most of these seed treatments, most of these microbial  
**[0:51:25-0:51:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:25):**  solutions, and again, I'd say, you know, 90, 99% of them are native, they're natural microbe  
**[0:51:31-0:51:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:31):**  solutions, right?  
**[0:51:32-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:32):**  But even the vetivo, the target there is, can you consistently demonstrate a three to  
**[0:51:39-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  five percent yield increase over not using it, over a control?  
**[0:51:46-0:51:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  That was really the benchmark there.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:49):**  In our case, and this is what makes what we're doing a bit of a moonshot is, you know, we're  
**[0:51:54-0:51:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:54):**  not, it's not going to be very interesting.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:58):**  We're not going to land on the moon if we simply reduce the nitrogen input by five percent.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  Or even frankly, if we have an engineered microbe that increases the yield by five percent,  
**[0:52:11-0:52:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:11):**  that's not going to, nobody's going to get excited about an engineered microbe if that's  
**[0:52:17-0:52:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:17):**  the limit of the benefit.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:20):**  The benefit has to be big.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:22):**  And if you look at, you know, genetic successes or places where genetics have been, except  
**[0:52:27-0:52:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:27):**  genetic modification has been allowed, if you will.  
**[0:52:32-0:52:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:32):**  You know, in Hawaii, they were going to lose all the papaya crop.  
**[0:52:36-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:36):**  So they allow the genetic modification that protected that.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:39):**  The same thing's happening now with chestnuts.  
**[0:52:42-0:52:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:42):**  We're going to lose all of our chestnuts, but we can, it is addressable with a genetic  
**[0:52:48-0:52:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:48):**  modification on it, right?  
**[0:52:50-0:52:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:50):**  So there's, if you confront people with this, like something where the benefit is so big  
**[0:52:56-0:53:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:56):**  that you can't close your eyes to it, then I think people will at least give the GMO  
**[0:53:05-0:53:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:05):**  or the engineered microbe.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:08):**  They'll look at it, they'll give it a chance.  
**[0:53:11-0:53:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:11):**  But you can't be, if you're just down there playing with the same yield increases or the  
**[0:53:16-0:53:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:16):**  same benefits that natural microbes provide, then we're, you know, we won't have been successful.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:23):**  And frankly, why would you spend the time and money to engineer something if a natural  
**[0:53:27-0:53:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:27):**  microbe is just as good?  
**[0:53:29-0:53:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:29):**  It wouldn't make any sense.  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:32):**  Right.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  No, I get where you're coming from.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:35):**  It's fascinating where this is going, and I can already see parts of the public pushing  
**[0:53:41-0:53:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:41):**  back because it's different.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:44):**  You're engineering something.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:46):**  It's not natural.  
**[0:53:48-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:48):**  For people that might think that, what are they missing maybe?  
**[0:53:53-0:54:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:53):**  Like what's the con argument to a lot of the anti-engineering of microbes that you hear?  
**[0:54:03-0:54:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:03):**  What part of the picture are they not seeing beyond the obvious benefit?  
**[0:54:07-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:07):**  But in terms of the some of the potential dangers or repercussions, I think that's where  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:10):**  people really get scared.  
**[0:54:15-0:54:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  So I think there's a series of sort of scientific responses that you can give to that.  
**[0:54:22-0:54:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:22):**  But frankly, the public's not interested in scientific responses.  
**[0:54:26-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:26):**  So we could get into a discussion about, do you understand how often microbes are mutating  
**[0:54:34-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:34):**  all the time?  
**[0:54:35-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:35):**  All the microbes that are out there, the microbes on your skin, microbes in your gut, all that,  
**[0:54:40-0:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  right?  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  These microbes are mutating randomly into things that we may not know what they do or  
**[0:54:45-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:45):**  don't do.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  And this is where some of the concern comes from, like disease, you know, pandemics and  
**[0:54:55-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  these things is, are things changing out there, not from people doing it, but just natural  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  mutation, natural evolution that's taking place.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:07):**  The benefit to what we're doing is we're doing it in a very controlled, totally known way.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  It's very directed.  
**[0:55:15-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:15):**  And once we do it, we also can test what happened and know exactly how it behaves, put it through  
**[0:55:21-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:21):**  all the safety tests.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:23):**  If it's happening naturally out there in the environment, you have no way, nobody's monitoring  
**[0:55:28-0:55:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:28):**  that.  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:29):**  So in some ways, you, by doing it this way, the argument would be, you've introduced more  
**[0:55:33-0:55:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:33):**  control and you're able to do the testing to ensure that you're adding benefit, but  
**[0:55:41-0:55:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:41):**  no harm.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:43):**  The problem with that is that kind of a science argument totally gets lost on the public.  
**[0:55:47-0:55:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:47):**  And what you have to do is come back with a more of an emotional type of discussion.  
**[0:55:56-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:56):**  And it really has to, the story has to start in the end with understanding the benefit.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:04):**  And kind of an extreme example is insulin.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:10):**  Insulin for diabetics actually is made from a genetically modified microbe.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  And, but I will guarantee you that there's nobody who's diabetic even thinks about the  
**[0:56:24-0:56:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:24):**  fact that their insulin comes from an engineered microbe because it keeps them alive.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:29):**  I mean, it's just, right.  
**[0:56:31-0:56:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:31):**  Nobody even questions that.  
**[0:56:32-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:32):**  Now, you could also make the argument, but wait a minute, that's still in a contained  
**[0:56:36-0:56:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  environment.  
**[0:56:37-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:37):**  Nobody actually injected the engineered microbe into the diabetic.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  They actually just took the product.  
**[0:56:44-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:44):**  So there is a difference there.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  And I would say for us, that's really the hurdle.  
**[0:56:50-0:56:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:50):**  That's one of the hurdles we've got to get over is can we convince people that moving  
**[0:56:56-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:56):**  these engineered microbes from a contained environment to out onto a corn seed or out  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  into a wheat field, that that's okay.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:07):**  And the answer to that has to be, partially has to be science driven.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:12):**  We have to run the safety tests, do the studies and answer everybody's questions.  
**[0:57:17-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:17):**  But it also, part of it will come in, well, why are you doing it?  
**[0:57:22-0:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  What problem are you solving?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:24):**  And if the problem you're solving is big enough, I believe people will give, it's in those  
**[0:57:29-0:57:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  situations that people will turn to new solutions or novel technologies that otherwise they  
**[0:57:36-0:57:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:36):**  might not be comfortable with.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:38):**  Right.  
**[0:57:39-0:57:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:39):**  And I guess in the ag side, and one approach is the no synthetic fertilizer side.  
**[0:57:45-0:57:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:45):**  And I get that approach and how some people make it work.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:49):**  On the other side, it's what's going to do more harm, introducing these engineered microbes  
**[0:57:55-0:58:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:55):**  to the environment or continuing to pour the same amount of synthetic chemicals on the  
**[0:58:00-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:00):**  environment and having all the repercussions of that both upstream and downstream, figuratively  
**[0:58:06-0:58:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  and literally.  
**[0:58:08-0:58:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:08):**  And you just got to say, which one are you more comfortable with?  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  And I think a lot of this is just the unknown, right?  
**[0:58:14-0:58:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:14):**  Like people, we're at a point now in science where a lot of our beliefs and what even seems  
**[0:58:24-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:24):**  possible is being challenged.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  Like the whole idea of engineering a microbe to fix nitrogen for a corn plant and do most  
**[0:58:33-0:58:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:33):**  of that in the second half of the corn plant's life and then cease to exist when the corn  
**[0:58:37-0:58:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:37):**  plant dies.  
**[0:58:40-0:58:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:40):**  It's really sci-fi to a lot of people.  
**[0:58:43-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  And when you can't understand it, I mean, you have fear and fear is a lot of times based  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  on what's unknown.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:48):**  And this is a total unknown for a lot of people.  
**[0:58:51-0:58:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:51):**  Yeah, I know it's a great point.  
**[0:58:55-0:59:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:55):**  And I think it's one of the things we've tried to think about early in this process is to  
**[0:59:04-0:59:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:04):**  not just focus on growers.  
**[0:59:06-0:59:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:06):**  So when we go out and talk to growers about this technology and we go out to talk to growers  
**[0:59:12-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:12):**  about, okay, what percent reduction in nitrogen would get you excited economically?  
**[0:59:19-0:59:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  Because at the end of the day for growers, you can talk all you want about environmental  
**[0:59:24-0:59:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:24):**  sustainability, but you also have to be able to talk about economics sustainability, right?  
**[0:59:30-0:59:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:30):**  And those growers are just trying to stay in business.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:33):**  They're trying to make a living and it's getting harder and harder.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:37):**  So whatever solutions you bring them, they need to be economically sustainable as well  
**[0:59:42-0:59:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:42):**  as environmentally sustainable.  
**[0:59:45-0:59:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:45):**  And for us, when we went out and talked to them, that cutoff points somewhere around  
**[0:59:50-0:59:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:50):**  25, 30% reduction.  
**[0:59:51-0:59:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:51):**  So once you get above 25, 30% reduction, the economics for that grower get really exciting,  
**[0:59:58-0:59:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:58):**  get really interesting.  
**[0:59:59-1:00:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:59):**  So from a profitability standpoint, which same as being economically sustainable.  
**[1:00:07-1:00:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:07):**  And so it's easy to focus on that.  
**[1:00:10-1:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:10):**  However, to your point, that's different than how the consumer looks at it.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:14):**  The grower and the consumer are two different entities.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:18):**  And I think if you look back on the history of GMOs, there was a huge focus on growers  
**[1:00:24-1:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:24):**  and little to no focus on consumers.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:27):**  And yet it was the consumers that have ended up being the ones who are the most distrustful  
**[1:00:33-1:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:33):**  or having the hardest time with, I would say, genetic engineering technology.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:38):**  And so we're really trying hard at this point to think about that and think about how to  
**[1:00:45-1:00:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:45):**  message and think about how to talk about it, not just with the grower, but also with  
**[1:00:51-1:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:51):**  the consumer.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:52):**  And again, you have to go into it recognizing the probability that you're going to get every  
**[1:00:58-1:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:58):**  consumer comfortable with a new technology is zero.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:05):**  It doesn't matter whether it's backseat.  
**[1:01:07-1:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:07):**  You think about any technology out there.  
**[1:01:09-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:09):**  If it's new, there's going to be a percentage of people who, no matter how convincing it  
**[1:01:15-1:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  is, they're going to be skeptical or concerned.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:19):**  And so you have to set your expectations on what you can and can't do there.  
**[1:01:26-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:26):**  So we're realistic about it.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  And it's certainly not a slam dunk.  
**[1:01:32-1:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  It's not a guarantee.  
**[1:01:34-1:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:34):**  But at the same time, we're so passionate about the potential that we think this approach  
**[1:01:40-1:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:40):**  has.  
**[1:01:42-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:42):**  And somebody's got to bring it out there for people to test and see and try.  
**[1:01:47-1:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  And if it really does work as well as we think it's going to, then we think there's a path  
**[1:01:53-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:53):**  to with the right safety data packages, with the right studies, with the right answers  
**[1:01:58-1:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  to people's questions.  
**[1:01:59-1:02:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:59):**  We think there's a path all the way to commercialization and actually making a difference in ag as  
**[1:02:05-1:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:05):**  a whole from a global perspective.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:09):**  One of the terms that's came up a lot here is the technology that you're using to do  
**[1:02:13-1:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:13):**  this synthetic biology.  
**[1:02:15-1:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:15):**  There's GMOs, there's CRISPR-Cas, which is gene editing, synthetic biology.  
**[1:02:22-1:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:22):**  How does that fit in compare or contrast against GMOs and CRISPR-Cas?  
**[1:02:29-1:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  I think it depends who you talk to.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:35):**  It's actually an interesting name if you think about it.  
**[1:02:38-1:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  Synthetic biology, the term would imply that you're synthesizing new life, that you're  
**[1:02:45-1:02:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:45):**  actually, that the biology you have is synthetic.  
**[1:02:49-1:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:49):**  And I don't think that's really not what we're doing.  
**[1:02:52-1:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:52):**  We're actually using these engineering techniques that are evolving and the technologies and  
**[1:03:00-1:03:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:00):**  the instrumentation and the software that allows this to happen at this molecular level,  
**[1:03:06-1:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:06):**  at the gene level.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:07):**  It's just remarkable now using those tools for specific purposes.  
**[1:03:13-1:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:13):**  And it just happens that the field adopted the name of synthetic biology.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:21):**  And if you look at some of the early pioneers there with Amaris and some of the early groups,  
**[1:03:30-1:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:30):**  they really pioneered this around biofuels, the whole drive for biofuels.  
**[1:03:34-1:03:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:34):**  And then that obviously collapsed.  
**[1:03:37-1:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:37):**  And so it required people to say, OK, it's really cool technology, but the commercial  
**[1:03:41-1:03:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:41):**  market went away.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:42):**  How do we reinvent ourselves?  
**[1:03:44-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:44):**  How do we, you know, how to end what they've done in different models, whether it's Zymogen  
**[1:03:49-1:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  or Ginkgo or synthetic genomics or Amaris or all these, they've all reinvented themselves  
**[1:03:54-1:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:54):**  around slightly different business models, but aimed at how do these tools, how does  
**[1:04:02-1:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:02):**  this technology, this really cool technology, how can it apply to specialty chemicals?  
**[1:04:08-1:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:08):**  How does it apply to fragrances?  
**[1:04:10-1:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:10):**  How can it apply to bioremediation?  
**[1:04:12-1:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:12):**  How can it apply to food ingredients?  
**[1:04:17-1:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:17):**  And maybe one of the biggest ones, how does it apply to pharmaceutical and biotech improvement?  
**[1:04:25-1:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:25):**  But they're all sort of based on this idea that microbes can do things that we can't  
**[1:04:34-1:04:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:34):**  do with synthetic chemistry.  
**[1:04:36-1:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:36):**  I mean, that's really the underlying, or that they can do things better and at a higher  
**[1:04:42-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:42):**  quality than what you can do with synthetic chemistry or without chemistry, you know,  
**[1:04:47-1:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  with a pure synthetic chemistry approach.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:50):**  And that's really the basis of it is understanding and harnessing, from my view, harnessing the  
**[1:04:55-1:05:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  power of what nature's put into these little microbes and harnessing it to produce metabolites  
**[1:05:05-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:05):**  or products or signal to plants in a way that a chemical can.  
**[1:05:12-1:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  Totally different property from a chemical.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:14):**  And that's why I think ultimately in agriculture, you're going to see, you know, 20 years from  
**[1:05:21-1:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:21):**  now, you're still going to see traits as a way to address some of the issues out there.  
**[1:05:27-1:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:27):**  You're going to still see chemicals, but I think you're going to have this whole new  
**[1:05:31-1:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:31):**  class of products or solutions that are based on optimized and engineered microbes that  
**[1:05:40-1:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:40):**  solve or solve problems that the chemicals or traits can't, or complement in a very positive  
**[1:05:47-1:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:47):**  way and in an incremental way, the problems that the chemicals and the traits are solving.  
**[1:05:54-1:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:54):**  And ultimately, you know, ultimately you've provided a whole new set of tools to the growers  
**[1:06:02-1:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:02):**  that are out there trying to feed the world.  
**[1:06:06-1:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:06):**  So in a way, I mean, do you think we've gone as far as we can with chemicals?  
**[1:06:11-1:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:11):**  The upside there is limited.  
**[1:06:13-1:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  That curve's flattening out and the microbial biological solution curve, like we're just  
**[1:06:20-1:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:20):**  taking off.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:21):**  That thing can just go exponential?  
**[1:06:23-1:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:23):**  It's you know, if you, one argument, I mean, one way to look at that is to, if you go back  
**[1:06:29-1:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:29):**  over the last 10 or 15 years and you take the R and D budgets for all the big ag companies,  
**[1:06:38-1:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:38):**  what percentage of that went to developing new chemical products or solutions?  
**[1:06:45-1:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:45):**  I mean, it's, you know, these R and D budgets these guys have are in the, you know, hundreds  
**[1:06:50-1:06:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:50):**  of millions to billions, right?  
**[1:06:52-1:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:52):**  All focused on either trait, either trait in the case of Monsanto and Pioneer, and now

**[1:07:04-1:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:04):**  Les Dow and DuPont and Alex Cortado.  
**[1:07:07-1:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:07):**  So just, I mean, just massive, massive R and D budgets all on small molecule chemical type  
**[1:07:15-1:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  solutions.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:16):**  And you look at how much money was spent on developing microbial solutions.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:22):**  And you know, 90% of it is all happening in these small venture capital based companies  
**[1:07:29-1:07:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:29):**  that are operating on R and D budgets of, you know, 5, 10, 15 million a year.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:34):**  I mean, in half for the last, right?  
**[1:07:37-1:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:37):**  So to me, it's not surprising that performance and consistency and the quality of trait and  
**[1:07:45-1:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:45):**  chemical solutions is up here.  
**[1:07:48-1:07:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:48):**  And down, you know, down here, you've got the microbials, because it's a, it haven't  
**[1:07:54-1:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:54):**  had the investment, they haven't had the understanding or the technology applied to them.  
**[1:08:00-1:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:00):**  And at the same time, if you think about where we are as a, as a scientific community, understanding  
**[1:08:07-1:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:07):**  the microbiome, how early it is, right?  
**[1:08:11-1:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:11):**  Because it's not to me, it's just understanding a microbe isn't enough from an agricultural  
**[1:08:16-1:08:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:16):**  perspective.  
**[1:08:17-1:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:17):**  You also have to understand that microbe in a soil microbiome, and in that plant microbe  
**[1:08:23-1:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:23):**  interaction, that plant microbe, microbiome.  
**[1:08:28-1:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:28):**  And our understanding of that is, it's such an early stage, right?  
**[1:08:35-1:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:35):**  That to me, it isn't surprising that you have the gap you have today between the two.  
**[1:08:43-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:43):**  And, you know, I think traits, you know, I think there's some problem, I think there's  
**[1:08:48-1:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:48):**  certain things that that's going to be ideal for.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:52):**  And that's going to continue to get the R&D spending, it's going to continue to try to  
**[1:08:57-1:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  solve problems in the big acre crops.  
**[1:09:01-1:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:01):**  I think that the chances that that technology goes out to fruits and vegetables and all  
**[1:09:07-1:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:07):**  these other crops that are used to feed the world, I think that's going to take time because  
**[1:09:12-1:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:12):**  of cost and just sheer cost that it takes to do that.  
**[1:09:18-1:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:18):**  And with chemicals, you've got, you know, you've got a regulatory challenge there, where  
**[1:09:26-1:09:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:26):**  the safety criteria and the safety bar has been raised so high, particularly from an  
**[1:09:32-1:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:32):**  environmental perspective, that to try to find chemical solutions that are so selective  
**[1:09:40-1:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:40):**  that the only insect that they affect is, you know, this one, but it has no effect on  
**[1:09:48-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:48):**  fish and no effect on bees and no effect on anything else.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  That's a big challenge.  
**[1:09:54-1:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:54):**  And if you look back, you know, if you go back in time, that selectivity factor, from  
**[1:10:02-1:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:02):**  my view, wasn't there.  
**[1:10:05-1:10:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:05):**  And you know, should it be there?  
**[1:10:07-1:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:07):**  Absolutely, right.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:09):**  If you think about environmental protection, environmental sustainability, but you have  
**[1:10:14-1:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:14):**  to recognize that with that selectivity and with those safety hurdles, you're going to  
**[1:10:20-1:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:20):**  dramatically reduce the amount of chemicals out there that are going to get registered  
**[1:10:24-1:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:24):**  in all likelihood.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:26):**  And it's made it more expensive to bring a new chemical to market because you not only  
**[1:10:31-1:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:31):**  do you have to do all the environmental testing, but you've also got to look at all the human  
**[1:10:36-1:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:36):**  talks and, you know, is there any chance it's carcinogenic?  
**[1:10:39-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:39):**  Well, okay, how long does that test take?  
**[1:10:42-1:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  You know, how long do you test something before you decide that it's not carcinogenic?  
**[1:10:46-1:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:46):**  And you get into the complexity of it is, and the risk of it just keeps getting higher  
**[1:10:54-1:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:54):**  and higher because our standards get higher and higher.  
**[1:10:58-1:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:58):**  So in the research you're doing with corn, is corn the lead domino here?  
**[1:11:03-1:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:03):**  Meaning if you can solve corn and get a microbe to start associating with corn, fixed nitrogen,  
**[1:11:10-1:11:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:10):**  that it will be, I'll say easier, not easy, but easier to then get one to associate with  
**[1:11:17-1:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:17):**  wheat or tomatoes or lettuce, but you got to do one before you can move on to all.  
**[1:11:24-1:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:24):**  Or do you see certain crops as just better candidates, not economically, but biologically?  
**[1:11:34-1:11:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:34):**  So one of the key reasons we're focused on corn is the size of the market.  
**[1:11:44-1:11:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:44):**  The economics help justify it.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:47):**  So if you're going to go, if it's Bayer and Ginkgo are going to go spend this money, they  
**[1:11:53-1:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:53):**  want it to be on something that's where the benefit is unquestioned.  
**[1:11:58-1:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:58):**  If you can do it on corn, everybody gets that.  
**[1:12:01-1:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:01):**  So you've got to, when you're doing a moonshot, you're doing something like this, you've got  
**[1:12:06-1:12:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:06):**  to have a strong story behind it.  
**[1:12:11-1:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:11):**  And clearly the other thing you want to do is you want to have the biggest impact environmentally.  
**[1:12:16-1:12:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:16):**  And so we could go solve this problem in lettuce or cabbage or tomatoes.  
**[1:12:23-1:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:23):**  It's not even going to move the needle from an environmental impact, which is part of  
**[1:12:27-1:12:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:27):**  what we're trying to show and part of what we're trying to do.  
**[1:12:30-1:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:30):**  Well, I mean, I get that part, but let's say you did solve corn and I get the whole big  
**[1:12:34-1:12:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:34):**  market side and then you went on to the next biggest crop.  
**[1:12:38-1:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:38):**  Is it once you do it once you understand enough to make it easier to do it again with another  
**[1:12:46-1:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:46):**  crop?  
**[1:12:47-1:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:47):**  Like, in other words, is the biggest hurdle the very first hurdle you have to go after  
**[1:12:51-1:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:51):**  or do you think each one of these crops are going to be equally as hard?  
**[1:12:56-1:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:56):**  If you had to look into crystal ball and look ahead.  
**[1:13:01-1:13:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:01):**  I think the first one, I think this first one with corn is absolutely the hardest one.  
**[1:13:06-1:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:06):**  And you think about, because we've got to be able to build all the assays to measure  
**[1:13:11-1:13:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:11):**  it.  
**[1:13:12-1:13:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:12):**  We've got to understand all the different key things we've done pathway wise.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:17):**  What I think will make other crops easier or make it go faster is that in parallel with  
**[1:13:25-1:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  the work in parallel with the work we're doing right now, we have another whole program built  
**[1:13:31-1:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:31):**  around identifying chassis, hosts or chassis that are potentially ideal for other crops.  
**[1:13:40-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:40):**  So you may have a, you're going to have a set of, you're going to have, you know, a  
**[1:13:45-1:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:45):**  handful of chassis that are particularly good for corn or corn like plants.  
**[1:13:49-1:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:49):**  We also think that you're going to have chassis that are particularly good for other types  
**[1:13:53-1:13:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:53):**  of crops as well as for other geographies.  
**[1:13:56-1:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:56):**  So as you change geographies, remember, these are living organisms.  
**[1:14:03-1:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:03):**  You know, something that works really well in tropical climates may not work that well  
**[1:14:08-1:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:08):**  in North Dakota, and vice versa, right?  
**[1:14:10-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:10):**  So and that's the beauty of being able to find these selected chassis or hosts.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  They can be selected for crop.  
**[1:14:20-1:14:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:20):**  They can be selected for geography.  
**[1:14:24-1:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:24):**  And when they're selected for geography, there's two aspects to that.  
**[1:14:28-1:14:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:28):**  One is climate, but the other is registration.  
**[1:14:31-1:14:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:31):**  So for example, if you, if we want to go and register a new microbe, even an engineer microbe  
**[1:14:37-1:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:37):**  down in Brazil, one of the most advantageous things we can have is to start with a microbe  
**[1:14:45-1:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:45):**  that's native from Brazil, right?  
**[1:14:48-1:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:48):**  They don't like new microbes coming in from, that have never been in Brazil before.  
**[1:14:55-1:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:55):**  And the same exact same thing is true in India, and the same thing is true in China.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:59):**  So in some of these other markets, bigger markets, if you can start with a microbe that's  
**[1:15:07-1:15:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:07):**  native to that country, your ability to go through the regulatory process is significantly  
**[1:15:13-1:15:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:13):**  enhanced.  
**[1:15:14-1:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:14):**  So this just comes back to this whole idea of building a library or a pool of these chassis,  
**[1:15:20-1:15:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:20):**  thinking about association with different crops, thinking about different geographies,  
**[1:15:27-1:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:27):**  and thinking about different geographies.  
**[1:15:29-1:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:29):**  And I think it really gets to your point, which is, you know, is corn going to be the  
**[1:15:34-1:15:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:34):**  hardest one?  
**[1:15:35-1:15:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:35):**  Absolutely.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:36):**  And if we can get it to work in corn at 30, 40%, and we understand why, and we engineered  
**[1:15:43-1:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:43):**  that, then it's really a matter of finding hosts or chassis that have similar colonization,  
**[1:15:50-1:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:50):**  similar symbiotic relationships, just with other crops that also, you know, that also  
**[1:15:58-1:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:58):**  could benefit from a nitrogen-fixing microbe.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:03):**  Do you think it's reasonably possible that this association between a non-legume and  
**[1:16:10-1:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:10):**  a nitrogen-fixing bacteria has occurred in the wild?  
**[1:16:13-1:16:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:13):**  It's just nobody has been able to find it because maybe they're just not looking.  
**[1:16:19-1:16:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:19):**  Like there's, if you think about the trillions and trillions of microbes out there in the  
**[1:16:24-1:16:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:24):**  soil, mutating all the time, trillions and trillions of non-leguminous plants, you'd  
**[1:16:30-1:16:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:30):**  think at some point in time, there has been some sort of mutation to make that cross.  
**[1:16:37-1:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:37):**  I mean, eventually it would go back far enough in history and that's how legumes came about.  
**[1:16:42-1:16:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:42):**  And is it, the reason I ask is because it's to say like, is it biologically possible?  
**[1:16:50-1:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:50):**  Like again, you must think it is if you're going for it, but if you guys can recreate  
**[1:16:56-1:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:56):**  it, then nature probably did, but we just probably haven't been able to find it and  
**[1:17:01-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:01):**  isolate it.  
**[1:17:02-1:17:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:02):**  Yeah, I think, I think it's exactly right.  
**[1:17:05-1:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:05):**  I think either nature has, and we haven't found it or it will, and we haven't given  
**[1:17:11-1:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:11):**  it enough time.  
**[1:17:14-1:17:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:14):**  And you know, so then you'd step back and say, well, where should I go look?  
**[1:17:18-1:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:18):**  Well, you probably want to look in geographies or areas where people are trying to grow corn  
**[1:17:25-1:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:25):**  with little to no nitrogen, right?  
**[1:17:28-1:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:28):**  Where there's a, you know, where it's deprived or so that, so that, you know, and almost  
**[1:17:34-1:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:34):**  happening in a natural, in a natural way so that those pressures are there to drive that  
**[1:17:41-1:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:41):**  association or drive that evolution.  
**[1:17:44-1:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:44):**  So do I think it's, you know, do I think it's happened that that microbe might be out there?  
**[1:17:52-1:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:52):**  You know, you can, nobody could ever say, you know, it's not possible.  
**[1:17:55-1:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:55):**  You think about the sheer numbers and complexity and like you say, the mutations going on,  
**[1:18:02-1:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:02):**  finding it, finding that, that magic microbe and thinking that, you know, and believing  
**[1:18:07-1:18:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:07):**  that, oh, that's the magic one to, the magic one to put on a, on a corn plant or that would  
**[1:18:13-1:18:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:13):**  associate with a corn plant.  
**[1:18:16-1:18:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:16):**  You know, people have been, people have been searching for that for 50 years, right?  
**[1:18:20-1:18:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:20):**  I mean, it's kind of Holy grail and they haven't been successful yet.  
**[1:18:25-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:25):**  Um, could they probably, but even if they found one, I would still argue that our approach  
**[1:18:33-1:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  and our technology could make it better.  
**[1:18:36-1:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:36):**  And it goes back to your question, Diego, that you were asking earlier is, you know,  
**[1:18:40-1:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:40):**  could this same technology improve, even improve even more on legume, uh, soy and peanut nitrogen  
**[1:18:50-1:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:50):**  production so that it actually became a delivery mechanism into the soil as opposed to just  
**[1:18:55-1:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:55):**  the, the yield or the production of that soy or peanut plant for that season.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:02):**  And I think you've got to believe, you know, if you believe in this technology, the answer  
**[1:19:06-1:19:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:06):**  is absolutely everything that we could continue to engineer and optimize and enhance it.  
**[1:19:11-1:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:11):**  Uh, and it's, it's a, you know, would be a, another great use of this technology.  
**[1:19:15-1:19:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:15):**  Um, you know, people are, people are talking up now, one of the hot topics now is, is,  
**[1:19:22-1:19:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:22):**  uh, sequestering carbon and, and, and the whole world in there is a business world around  
**[1:19:28-1:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:28):**  that.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:29):**  But, you know, we also, you know, when we're, when we're fantasizing, uh, we also think  
**[1:19:33-1:19:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:33):**  about, wow, I wonder, you know, is there a way that you could use the use microbes as  
**[1:19:38-1:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:38):**  a way to increase, uh, carbon sequestering both around the roots of the plant or in the  
**[1:19:44-1:19:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:44):**  plant as well as in the soil.  
**[1:19:45-1:19:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:45):**  Uh, and you know, again, if you believe in this technology and, and if you just let your  
**[1:19:51-1:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:51):**  head go, you know, where could this go at some point?  
**[1:19:54-1:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:54):**  Um, I think all those things become, they're still science fiction.  
**[1:19:58-1:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:58):**  Uh, but they certainly now with the time where we're going with this stuff, they suddenly,  
**[1:20:05-1:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:05):**  it becomes a very different playing field than all, all I have, the only microbes I  
**[1:20:11-1:20:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:11):**  can use are the ones that I find out there and isolate is natural microbes.  
**[1:20:16-1:20:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:16):**  You open up a whole new world from a design standpoint of what you, what you can design  
**[1:20:22-1:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:22):**  that microbe, what you can optimize that microbe to do.  
**[1:20:26-1:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:26):**  So really, I mean, in 50 years, it could essentially be anything, water improvement, improving  
**[1:20:32-1:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:32):**  nutrient utilization, isolating specific nutrients out of the minerals and rocks and the soil,  
**[1:20:41-1:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:41):**  like it's just really the world is the oyster here and this is a whole new frontier when  
**[1:20:46-1:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:46):**  it comes to ag.  
**[1:20:48-1:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:48):**  It is.  
**[1:20:49-1:20:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:49):**  And it's a, and I'd like to think that the, you know, some of the pioneering work we're  
**[1:20:53-1:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:53):**  going to do on the ag side, um, will also spill over into some of these other fields.  
**[1:20:59-1:21:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:59):**  Um, and I think, you know, and, but I think the one thing on all of these, all of these  
**[1:21:06-1:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:06):**  different applications are going to have, you know, have to find or have in common is  
**[1:21:12-1:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:12):**  they're going to have to find that chassis or host works for that application.  
**[1:21:17-1:21:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:17):**  And I think that's one of the things that's so unique for, um, applications like agriculture,  
**[1:21:24-1:21:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:24):**  bio remediation, uh, you know, applications like that, where the microbe you're taking  
**[1:21:31-1:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:31):**  advantage of the fact that microbes do exist and can exist and even can thrive outside  
**[1:21:37-1:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:37):**  of a tank.  
**[1:21:38-1:21:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:38):**  They can do that in the environment.  
**[1:21:40-1:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:40):**  And so can we find ones that, that do that either by their association with the plant  
**[1:21:47-1:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:47):**  or, uh, how much oil they chew up in a bioremediation sense?  
**[1:21:51-1:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:51):**  And can we harness and optimize that through engineering into a product that a grower or  
**[1:21:59-1:22:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:59):**  somebody can use commercially?  
**[1:22:01-1:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:01):**  So can we, can we take it from an interesting science experiment, which is great.  
**[1:22:06-1:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:06):**  That's your technical proof of concept, but for us, you know, landing on the moon means  
**[1:22:12-1:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:12):**  that that product is in the hands of a grower, right.  
**[1:22:16-1:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:16):**  That he can use to produce food on a global basis.  
**[1:22:21-1:22:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:21):**  That's when you've landed on the moon.  
**[1:22:23-1:22:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:23):**  And if he can do it with half of the fertilizer that he originally needed, I mean, whether  
**[1:22:29-1:22:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:29):**  it's, whether it's increasing production in the third world, where they don't have access  
**[1:22:34-1:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:34):**  to synthetic fertilizer, like we do in the U S or whether it's creating a more sustainable  
**[1:22:40-1:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:40):**  way to grow crops in the U S by dramatically reducing what you do put out there.  
**[1:22:45-1:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:45):**  Either one is to me is a, is a, is a big transformative benefit to agriculture as a whole, or it certainly,  
**[1:22:53-1:22:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:53):**  at this point, and we're, we're careful at this point, you have to keep putting in the  
**[1:22:56-1:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:56):**  word potential.  
**[1:22:57-1:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:57):**  But until, until we've, till we've actually done it and have the rigorous field trial,  
**[1:23:03-1:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:03):**  rigorous science behind it, we, we, you know, it's really just talking about it from a potential  
**[1:23:09-1:23:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:09):**  perspective.  
**[1:23:10-1:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:10):**  To give people some idea of the scale or complexity that goes into this research, just identifying  
**[1:23:18-1:23:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:18):**  the chassis to create this symbiotic relationship with corn.  
**[1:23:24-1:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:24):**  Is it something where you're starting with a million potential choices and you've got  
**[1:23:30-1:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:30):**  to narrow it down to 500?  
**[1:23:32-1:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:32):**  Like, like how, what does the funnel look like in terms of how much you have to sift  
**[1:23:36-1:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:36):**  through and how much do you try and got to get it down to, to even go to the next stage?  
**[1:23:45-1:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:45):**  The way we're looking at it now, I think you start with, you know, thousands in the thousands,  
**[1:23:53-1:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:53):**  not, not millions.  
**[1:23:54-1:23:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:54):**  So thousand, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:58):**  But these would be microbes that already have sort of been pre characterized in some way.  
**[1:24:05-1:24:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:05):**  And then when they come out of that funnel, maybe you're down to something more manageable,  
**[1:24:10-1:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:10):**  you know, in that, let's say 50 to 250 level that you can then start to say, gee, how,  
**[1:24:19-1:24:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:19):**  how easy is it to engineer?  
**[1:24:21-1:24:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:21):**  How safe is, you know, how much, how stable is it?  
**[1:24:23-1:24:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:23):**  Some of these factors.  
**[1:24:26-1:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:26):**  And how long have you guys been working on this for so far to date?  
**[1:24:30-1:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:30):**  This one probably, I guess, fairly early on, maybe six months.  
**[1:24:35-1:24:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:35):**  Okay.  
**[1:24:36-1:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:36):**  So six months on this early stage.  
**[1:24:37-1:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:37):**  And if you, if you had to get, yeah, so it's, we've been working with, we've been working  
**[1:24:43-1:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:43):**  with some early chassis that we had, but it was as we worked with some of these early  
**[1:24:50-1:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:50):**  chassis, it sort of, we recognize how critical it was, how critical the characterization  
**[1:24:57-1:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:57):**  of these, of the additional chassis was going to be.  
**[1:25:00-1:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:00):**  So we're really jump-starting that and really focused in on, on that as a key part of our  
**[1:25:06-1:25:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:06):**  key part of our research right now.  
**[1:25:08-1:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:08):**  Because if you think about it, if you, if you don't, if you don't have chassis, if you  
**[1:25:15-1:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:15):**  don't have chassis that can colonize and associate with the plant, is that delivery vehicle.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:23):**  The concept really, it's hard to picture how the concept is going to work.  
**[1:25:27-1:25:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:27):**  Right, right.  
**[1:25:28-1:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:28):**  It's almost like those are your, those are your blank tapes or your DVDs.  
**[1:25:31-1:25:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:31):**  And okay, that's what you're starting with.  
**[1:25:33-1:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:33):**  You can write the content onto those.  
**[1:25:36-1:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:36):**  They are.  
**[1:25:37-1:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:37):**  And it's, it's, it's novel because again, for the last eight years, the, you know, the  
**[1:25:42-1:25:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:42):**  synthetic biology community has focused on E. coli and yeast and these, these, and so  
**[1:25:49-1:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:49):**  they're super well characterized.  
**[1:25:52-1:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:52):**  Everybody knows how to work with them, but they have, they have to be done in a contained  
**[1:25:56-1:25:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:56):**  environment.  
**[1:25:57-1:26:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:57):**  So you go back to the beginning of our discussion, you know, the big, one of the big hurdles  
**[1:26:03-1:26:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:03):**  for us is can we take synthetic biology and move it from a contained environment to a  
**[1:26:10-1:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:10):**  cornfield or an agricultural environment?  
**[1:26:13-1:26:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:13):**  That's a big jump.  
**[1:26:15-1:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:15):**  And and you're only going to make that jump if you have chassis that have the characteristics  
**[1:26:22-1:26:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:22):**  like we've talked about.  
**[1:26:23-1:26:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:23):**  Right.  
**[1:26:24-1:26:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:24):**  And so this, now I'm more knowledgeable about this.  
**[1:26:26-1:26:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:26):**  If we go back to one of the earlier questions, I mean, one of the potential paths is you  
**[1:26:30-1:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:30):**  take a legume and you now get it to associate with corn.  
**[1:26:34-1:26:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:34):**  Well, that's, doesn't sound like that's going to meet your chassis requirement because it  
**[1:26:38-1:26:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:38):**  doesn't have a preexisting relationship with corn.  
**[1:26:42-1:26:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:42):**  If you had to do that, so you take something that works with soybeans and shift it over  
**[1:26:46-1:26:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:46):**  to corn, what, what's the factor there that you're fighting against?  
**[1:26:51-1:26:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:51):**  You got to get the corn to accept that?  
**[1:26:57-1:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:57):**  You either have to get, yeah, you either have to find, find a association or a symbiosis  
**[1:27:05-1:27:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:05):**  there.  
**[1:27:06-1:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:06):**  Right.  
**[1:27:07-1:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:07):**  I think at this stage of our knowledge, engineering that into say the rhizobia, into the soy,  
**[1:27:16-1:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:16):**  the soy microbe, that's, that's really beyond our capabilities right now to think you could  
**[1:27:23-1:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:23):**  change, change an organism or change a microbe to that level.  
**[1:27:28-1:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:28):**  That's a, that's a level of engineering that's, you know, five, 10, 15 years out.  
**[1:27:34-1:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:34):**  It's not the reality of what we have today.  
**[1:27:36-1:27:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:36):**  It sounds like, I mean, like we don't even know why the plant and that specific microbe  
**[1:27:42-1:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:42):**  talk to each other.  
**[1:27:43-1:27:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:43):**  So if you don't know the language that they're using to communicate, you can't set the speaker  
**[1:27:50-1:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:50):**  or the receiver on either side to actually communicate.  
**[1:27:54-1:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:54):**  Is that kind of a layman's way of thinking about it?  
**[1:27:56-1:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:56):**  Yeah, I think it's, it's, it's just, I mean, I think we're, we're, we're just in the very,  
**[1:28:00-1:28:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:00):**  very early days of starting to stand and see some of that.  
**[1:28:04-1:28:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:04):**  So there's, I wouldn't say that we don't know anything.  
**[1:28:07-1:28:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:07):**  I think there are researchers, particularly in academia who have, um, identified signaling  
**[1:28:13-1:28:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:13):**  maul, signaling and stuff that we know some of the signaling that's going on, but, you  
**[1:28:19-1:28:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:19):**  know, compared to the whole picture and compared to what's going on, you know, with, with hundreds,  
**[1:28:24-1:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:24):**  if not thousands and millions of microbes, it's just, it's very, very early days.  
**[1:28:30-1:28:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:30):**  What we do know for sure is that that signaling and these communities are, are out there.  
**[1:28:40-1:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:40):**  They're real.  
**[1:28:41-1:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:41):**  We do know that, that, that there is a plant microbiome and we know that that plant microbiome  
**[1:28:46-1:28:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:46):**  and the soil microbiome together play a significant role in the health and the productivity of  
**[1:28:59-1:29:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:59):**  that plant.  
**[1:29:01-1:29:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:01):**  What we don't fully understand is that we know that much, but how you can go in there,  
**[1:29:07-1:29:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:07):**  going in there and identifying the, if there's a handful of key drivers, if there's key signals  
**[1:29:13-1:29:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:13):**  and key, and again, just when you think, okay, I think I can zero in on this.  
**[1:29:20-1:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:20):**  You might be looking at a cornfield in Iowa and does that even apply to a cornfield in  
**[1:29:26-1:29:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:26):**  Brazil?  
**[1:29:27-1:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:27):**  I mean, is it, it's just this complexity.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:29):**  There's a complex piece of it that's, that's pretty daunting in terms of understanding  
**[1:29:35-1:29:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:35):**  agriculture at the individual plant level.  
**[1:29:40-1:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:40):**  So if you, if you really want to like make your head spin, you know, we talk about in  
**[1:29:45-1:29:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:45):**  human health, we talk about personalized medicine, right?  
**[1:29:48-1:29:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:48):**  Oh, and because each of our genomes is specific, we're going to develop, you know, we're going  
**[1:29:53-1:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:53):**  to develop a, a medical solution for each of us that's personalized to our DNA, to our,  
**[1:30:00-1:30:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:00):**  you know, our genomics, right?  
**[1:30:01-1:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:01):**  So personalized medicine.  
**[1:30:04-1:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:04):**  Imagine if you had to think about that for agriculture and you're going to develop that  
**[1:30:09-1:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:09):**  personalized for each individual plant and you just go, no, that's impossible.  
**[1:30:15-1:30:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:15):**  I mean, we, we work on thousands of acres and we work on hundreds and hundreds of greenhouses  
**[1:30:21-1:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:21):**  or, you know, whatever, but, but the idea that you would have something specific to  
**[1:30:25-1:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:25):**  that plant, yet that micro environment that each of those plants is in, it is probably,  
**[1:30:32-1:30:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:32):**  it is different.  
**[1:30:33-1:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:33):**  And each one is just, just like, you know, every person out there from a personalized  
**[1:30:39-1:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:39):**  medicine perspective is different.  
**[1:30:41-1:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:41):**  It's just that, you know, there's three, 4 billion people and there's, you know, quadrillions  
**[1:30:46-1:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:46):**  of micro.  
**[1:30:47-1:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:47):**  So it's, it's into the complexity piece of it and stuff, but it's, so on one hand, it's  
**[1:30:52-1:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:52):**  really daunting and it's humbling to think about what an early stage we are in terms  
**[1:30:59-1:31:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:59):**  of uncovering this.  
**[1:31:01-1:31:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:01):**  And at the same time, it's super exciting to see where the tools to do this have evolved  
**[1:31:08-1:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:08):**  to in such a short time.  
**[1:31:10-1:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:10):**  If you go back 10 years, look at the cost of sequencing, look at the technology people  
**[1:31:15-1:31:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:15):**  were using, you fast forward to today, it's absolutely stunning both on the instrument  
**[1:31:21-1:31:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:21):**  technology side and on the software algorithm, computational biology side and the, you know,  
**[1:31:29-1:31:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:29):**  the learning, you know, the learning tools that are there to do sort of, you know, in  
**[1:31:37-1:31:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:37):**  Ginkgo language to do like design, build, test and keep doing iterations over and over  
**[1:31:42-1:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:42):**  and over again, looking to optimize, looking for these, you know, in the sense, you know,  
**[1:31:48-1:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:48):**  engineering biological samples, the same way that an engineer was, you know, doing computer  
**[1:31:57-1:32:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:57):**  code, it's just, you've got four bases instead of, you know, on and off kind of thing, a  
**[1:32:06-1:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:06):**  zero and a one.  
**[1:32:07-1:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:07):**  But it's, you know, the idea is your, you know, nature has programmed things at a level  
**[1:32:14-1:32:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:14):**  of complexity and, you know, that we can't even comprehend right now, right?  
**[1:32:19-1:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:19):**  It's just, when we think about we program computers to do things, you look at what nature's  
**[1:32:25-1:32:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:25):**  going to do at the end, and so tapping into that and starting to understand that and starting  
**[1:32:29-1:32:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:29):**  to be able to optimize it or do things in a highly selective way for a particular outcome,  
**[1:32:37-1:32:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:37):**  that's really the early stages that we're at right now.  
**[1:32:40-1:32:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:40):**  And, you know, the tools are going to get better, the knowledge is going to get better.  
**[1:32:46-1:32:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:46):**  But at the same time, the need, the need for this innovation, the need for these products,  
**[1:32:51-1:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:51):**  the need for these solutions, just keeps growing.  
**[1:32:55-1:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:55):**  And so that's, you know, we come into work every day, or well, we don't come into work  
**[1:33:01-1:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:01):**  as much as we used to.  
**[1:33:05-1:33:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:05):**  But for the lab people coming in, you know, that's really what's, that's really what's  
**[1:33:09-1:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:09):**  driving everybody is the, you know, understanding just how important it is that we come up with  
**[1:33:15-1:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:15):**  some new, some new biotech type tools that are going to help these growers and are going  
**[1:33:20-1:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:20):**  to help address, you know, all these different aspects of food production.  
**[1:33:25-1:33:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:25):**  If you could look ahead being six months into this, how long do you think you'd have to  
**[1:33:31-1:33:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:31):**  go into the future to see a nitrogen fixing microbe that associates with a corn plant?  
**[1:33:38-1:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:38):**  Forget the regulatory side, like something you could use on a test plot in the ground,  
**[1:33:43-1:33:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:43):**  in the wild, it's working.  
**[1:33:46-1:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:46):**  How far out is that?  
**[1:33:47-1:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:47):**  Is that five years?  
**[1:33:49-1:33:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:49):**  Is that 10 years?  
**[1:33:50-1:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:50):**  Where do you think we're at?  
**[1:33:52-1:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:52):**  I think based on where we are today, I would say optimistically two to three.  
**[1:34:01-1:34:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:01):**  Wow.  
**[1:34:02-1:34:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:02):**  So pretty close.  
**[1:34:03-1:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:03):**  You know, and then could, you know, could it take four to five?  
**[1:34:06-1:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:06):**  Sure.  
**[1:34:07-1:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:07):**  I mean, we're not, but we've made some pretty significant, you know, we've made progress  
**[1:34:11-1:34:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:11):**  to date.  
**[1:34:13-1:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:13):**  We're getting a better and better understanding of not only what to do, but when we do those  
**[1:34:21-1:34:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:21):**  things, you know, what kind of impact it has.  
**[1:34:23-1:34:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:23):**  So now we won't, which to your point, there's a difference between having field trial, having  
**[1:34:33-1:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:33):**  this work in a field trial and having a commercial product that's on every corn seed.  
**[1:34:41-1:34:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:41):**  Because in between those two things is you have to have adoption by Bayer and Pioneer  
**[1:34:47-1:34:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:47):**  and because they, you know, because they control the corn seed and you want it to go, ideally  
**[1:34:54-1:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:54):**  you want it to go on as that seed treatment.  
**[1:34:56-1:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:56):**  So realistically, even after you have something that works, they're going to test it minimum  
**[1:35:03-1:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:03):**  of two years before they go and put it on everyone, you know, all their corn seed.  
**[1:35:09-1:35:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:09):**  So there's always this, there's a delay there if you're going to go out as a seed treatment  
**[1:35:14-1:35:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:14):**  and you're going to go to market through Corteva and through Bayer, there's going to be a built  
**[1:35:20-1:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:20):**  in delay of a couple of years just because that's how the process works.  
**[1:35:24-1:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:24):**  They don't believe anybody's data but their own, rightfully so.  
**[1:35:28-1:35:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:28):**  And they're not going to jeopardize a multi-billion dollar corn franchise, right, on something  
**[1:35:36-1:35:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:36):**  that they're not positive is going to work as well as they say it will.  
**[1:35:40-1:35:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:40):**  So if you tell growers they can cut their fertilizer by 40% and they go do it and their  
**[1:35:47-1:35:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:47):**  yield goes down, that's not a good day.  
**[1:35:51-1:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:51):**  And so you really, this gets back to sort of the consistency and the performance that  
**[1:35:55-1:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:55):**  we were talking about.  
**[1:35:57-1:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:57):**  When you play in the ag world, you've got, you know, your products have to perform, they  
**[1:36:02-1:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:02):**  have to be reliable.  
**[1:36:04-1:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:04):**  They're going into an environment that is just loaded with risk.  
**[1:36:10-1:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:10):**  They don't know, they can't control weather, they can't control all these things.  
**[1:36:15-1:36:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:15):**  So the things they can control, like what products they use, they better work and they  
**[1:36:20-1:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:20):**  better be reliable and they better trust you.  
**[1:36:23-1:36:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:23):**  And so you've got, that's the environment you're selling into in the ag world.  
**[1:36:28-1:36:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:28):**  And so you have to accept that adoption goes fairly slowly unless, again, unless there's  
**[1:36:36-1:36:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:36):**  suddenly there's a crisis, right?  
**[1:36:38-1:36:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:38):**  If you're at risk with losing a whole crop, if you're at risk with, you know, if everything's  
**[1:36:42-1:36:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:42):**  at stake, then you might adopt a little faster.  
**[1:36:48-1:36:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:48):**  And so, you know, if you fast forward three, four years and you're starting to see some  
**[1:36:52-1:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:52):**  serious regulatory pressure on growers in the Midwest on how much nitrogen they can  
**[1:36:58-1:37:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:58):**  use because it's getting into the groundwater or whatever, all of a sudden their incentive  
**[1:37:03-1:37:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:03):**  to look for alternatives goes up pretty dramatically.  
**[1:37:07-1:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:07):**  And that's certainly, you know, I've always found it challenging to try to predict regulatory  
**[1:37:14-1:37:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:14):**  timelines.  
**[1:37:15-1:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:15):**  That's in any direction.  
**[1:37:17-1:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:17):**  So you have to be careful.  
**[1:37:18-1:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:18):**  But my point is, when faced with something pretty dramatic, if somebody has a solution,  
**[1:37:25-1:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:25):**  your willingness to try something new is higher depending on how big the crisis is or how  
**[1:37:30-1:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:30):**  big the challenge is.  
**[1:37:32-1:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:32):**  Well considering this has been, like you said, the holy grail of what a lot of people in  
**[1:37:36-1:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:36):**  ag have been looking for to wait five years, isn't that long term?  
**[1:37:40-1:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:40):**  Yet just to close this out, I mean, one thing I'm curious of, as a business owner, your  
**[1:37:47-1:37:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:47):**  CEO of a company where you're looking five, ten years into the future, a lot of business  
**[1:37:54-1:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:54):**  is turn and burn, minimum viable product, like get something out there, sell it, let's  
**[1:37:58-1:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:37:58):**  keep churning through product.  
**[1:38:01-1:38:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:01):**  How do you approach a business, a project, looking at something that's so far out in  
**[1:38:08-1:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:08):**  the future and still be optimistic about it, still come in excited about it every day,  
**[1:38:14-1:38:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:14):**  still keep grinding in the face of failure when one, it's a hard task, it's almost a  
**[1:38:18-1:38:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:18):**  seemingly impossible task to begin with, and two, it's just, it's gonna take a long time.  
**[1:38:24-1:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:24):**  And in so many people listening to this, watching this, they have trouble taking on projects  
**[1:38:29-1:38:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:29):**  that are gonna take more than two weeks, and here's one that might take a decade.  
**[1:38:34-1:38:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:34):**  How do you do that?  
**[1:38:36-1:38:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:36):**  I think there's a couple pieces to it.  
**[1:38:39-1:38:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:39):**  One is, I think, myself and the team that I built.  
**[1:38:44-1:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:44):**  I think we understood what the challenge was, and we knew what we were getting into when  
**[1:38:50-1:38:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:50):**  we started.  
**[1:38:51-1:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:51):**  So we were intentionally set up as a moonshot.  
**[1:38:56-1:39:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:38:56):**  We were set up with the idea that this was a big task, and we all kind of stepped into  
**[1:39:03-1:39:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:03):**  this knowing that this was high risk.  
**[1:39:06-1:39:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:06):**  At the same time, if we're successful with it, it could have a dramatic impact.  
**[1:39:13-1:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:13):**  It could really be transformative, and that in itself is exciting.  
**[1:39:17-1:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:17):**  We also have expanded the portfolio of projects we're working on, so it's not just the nitrogen  
**[1:39:23-1:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:23):**  fixation, but we have some other pests and disease projects we're working on that probably  
**[1:39:32-1:39:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:32):**  could come to fruition, at least from a technical proof of concept, sooner.  
**[1:39:36-1:39:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:36):**  So we'll get some earlier successes to make sure we can show how well the technology works.  
**[1:39:43-1:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:43):**  And then I think scientists are always, when you're in these projects like this, you're  
**[1:39:48-1:39:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:48):**  always looking at getting to the next stage.  
**[1:39:53-1:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:53):**  When you can go from an in vitro success to an in vivo and in planta success, and then  
**[1:39:58-1:40:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:58):**  you can go from a greenhouse success to a field success.  
**[1:40:01-1:40:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:01):**  I think we all understand that in these type of development programs, you don't go from  
**[1:40:08-1:40:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:08):**  zero to 60 overnight.  
**[1:40:11-1:40:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:11):**  You know that that's what it's going to take.  
**[1:40:14-1:40:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:14):**  But what keeps you going is each of these steps that you're going up is in itself is  
**[1:40:25-1:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:25):**  a reward and gets exciting.  
**[1:40:27-1:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:27):**  So I think both of those, knowing what we got into.  
**[1:40:32-1:40:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:32):**  And I think deep down in everybody, I think on a daily basis, you're also driven by how  
**[1:40:39-1:40:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:39):**  important the need is, the potential impact you can have and the need for it.  
**[1:40:45-1:40:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:45):**  And we all believe in microbes.  
**[1:40:50-1:40:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:50):**  We all believe in biotechnology and the genomics and the microbial engineering.  
**[1:40:56-1:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:56):**  And we're all pretty passionate about agriculture and how important it's going to be to the  
**[1:41:01-1:41:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:01):**  future of food security and food on a global basis to come up with some of these new solutions.  
**[1:41:08-1:41:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:08):**  I think it's pretty clear that the status quo is not going to get us there when we have  
**[1:41:13-1:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:13):**  5, 6, 7 billion people.  
**[1:41:17-1:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:17):**  There's plenty of drivers and plenty of motivation.  
**[1:41:22-1:41:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:22):**  And if you love that intersection of science and business puzzles, right now, I mean, ag's  
**[1:41:30-1:41:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:30):**  one of the funnest places to be.  
**[1:41:33-1:41:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:33):**  Because there's very few things that have all the different pieces to it.  
**[1:41:39-1:41:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:39):**  And you've got to know the consumer.  
**[1:41:41-1:41:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:41):**  You've got to know the grower.  
**[1:41:42-1:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:42):**  The science has to work.  
**[1:41:44-1:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:44):**  And you've got to make it work as a business.  
**[1:41:46-1:41:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:46):**  It's got to make sense as a business venture.  
**[1:41:49-1:41:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:49):**  So it's fun.  
**[1:41:51-1:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:51):**  And the team is highly motivated.  
**[1:41:55-1:42:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:55):**  We've got two great parents supporting us in Bayer and Ginkgo.  
**[1:42:00-1:42:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:00):**  And we'll see where it takes us.  
**[1:42:03-1:42:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:03):**  But at this point, we're cautiously optimistic.  
**[1:42:06-1:42:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:06):**  Well, it's a good place to be.  
**[1:42:08-1:42:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:08):**  And one final thought.  
**[1:42:11-1:42:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:11):**  What would you want growers, farmers to know about the future of agriculture from where  
**[1:42:17-1:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:17):**  you sit?  
**[1:42:19-1:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:19):**  I guess, I think to me, maybe the most important thing to think about is speed.  
**[1:42:31-1:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:31):**  And I think what worries me right now, and what should worry people, is that an average  
**[1:42:38-1:42:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:38):**  product, new product in agriculture, whether it's a chemical product or a trade product,  
**[1:42:43-1:42:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:43):**  average development time is 10 to 12, 14 years.  
**[1:42:47-1:42:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:47):**  And with climate change and regulatory change and all that's happening that these growers  
**[1:42:54-1:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:54):**  are faced with, they can't wait 10, 12, 14 years for a new solution.  
**[1:43:01-1:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:01):**  Things will have already changed.  
**[1:43:03-1:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:03):**  So in the same way that people are looking at how fast we're developing vaccines for  
**[1:43:10-1:43:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:10):**  COVID, if you shift your mind and a problem becomes big enough, you find new ways to do  
**[1:43:16-1:43:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:16):**  things.  
**[1:43:17-1:43:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:17):**  The beauty of science, the beauty of innovation, the power of necessity, that you have to do  
**[1:43:23-1:43:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:23):**  it.  
**[1:43:24-1:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:24):**  And so I think, to me, a key lesson from this whole COVID thing that we need to take into  
**[1:43:31-1:43:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:31):**  agriculture is thinking about how fast as a scientific community, how are we going to  
**[1:43:38-1:43:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:38):**  be able to bring new solutions the same way these companies today are trying to bring  
**[1:43:43-1:43:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:43):**  vaccines in one to two years when it used to take five to 10?  
**[1:43:48-1:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:48):**  How do you think, you know, and so I think agriculture as a whole needs to be thinking  
**[1:43:52-1:43:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:52):**  about that.  
**[1:43:53-1:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:53):**  And I think speed of development, speed of new products is going to be critical because  
**[1:44:00-1:44:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:00):**  of the rate that things are changing.  
**[1:44:02-1:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:02):**  And we're going to have to rethink how we do things if we're going to be able to give  
**[1:44:07-1:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:07):**  these growers solutions in a timely fashion.  
**[1:44:10-1:44:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:10):**  I think it's one of the big learnings for me individually that's come out of this whole  
**[1:44:14-1:44:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:14):**  COVID thing and watching how this whole race for vaccines has accelerated.  
**[1:44:22-1:44:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:22):**  And I mean, if you told people two years ago that you could develop a vaccine, even think  
**[1:44:27-1:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:27):**  about it, in 12 months, they would have laughed at you.  
**[1:44:31-1:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:31):**  But now they're, you know, now they're trying.  
**[1:44:34-1:44:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:34):**  And whether it's going to be, you know, in 12 months or 18 or 24, it's going to happen  
**[1:44:39-1:44:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:39):**  in all likelihood at a record pace.  
**[1:44:41-1:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:41):**  And that same mindset and approach, I think agriculture has got to be thinking about that,  
**[1:44:47-1:44:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:47):**  ideally, before it's needed, not after.  
**[1:44:50-1:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:50):**  Yeah, it's amazing, exciting times.  
**[1:44:53-1:44:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:53):**  And it's cool to get an inside look at it.  
**[1:44:56-1:45:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:56):**  So Mike from Joyanne, I want to thank you for coming on and sharing your thoughts today.  
**[1:45:00-1:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-06-JOYN-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:00):**  I mean, it's been interesting on my part.

**[0:00:00-0:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:21):**  Soil macrophauna.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  Earthworms, beetles, ants, termites.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  They're the engineers of the soil.  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  They open up pathways to allow air, water, and roots to go deep down in the soil, and  
**[0:00:33-0:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  they help hold soil together by creating aggregate particles.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:38):**  Today we're talking about soil macrophauna with Italian researcher Adriano Sofo.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  Dr. Sofo is someone who spent a career looking at small animals within the soil and the effects  
**[0:00:50-0:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  that they perform on the soil.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:52):**  In addition to macrophauna, we'll also be talking about the benefits of sustainable  
**[0:00:56-0:00:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  or regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:59):**  How practices like no-till can make a big difference in soil structure and how we can  
**[0:01:04-0:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:04):**  add more carbon to the soil.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:07):**  Let's get into it with Dr. Adriano Sofo.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:12):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  When you look at traditional agricultural practices, you have chemical fertilizer, you  
**[0:01:23-0:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:23):**  have chemical sprays for herbicides or fungicides, you have tillage.  
**[0:01:33-0:01:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:33):**  Is there one of those that you think is worse than the others in terms of depleting soils  
**[0:01:41-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:41):**  of organic matter and reducing biodiversity?  
**[0:01:49-0:01:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  Of course, all of these practices can reduce organic matter and reduce biodiversity.  
**[0:01:59-0:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:59):**  But especially for soil fauna and microorganisms, tillage and ploughing are very important,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:11):**  relevant.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:13):**  So we observed a significant increase of biodiversity in plants, plant biodiversity, soil biodiversity  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:26):**  in no-tillage soil or in soils with minimum tillage.  
**[0:02:34-0:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:34):**  Why this?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:36):**  Because most of the fertility of a soil and of the biodiversity is in the first 30 centimeters  
**[0:02:46-0:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:46):**  of soil.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:50):**  And the traditional practices adopted by farmers in our area, plough soil, included ploughing  
**[0:02:58-0:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:58):**  up to 30 centimeters and more so they can destroy completely the microfauna.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:07):**  And in this way, we select bacterial and fungal groups that are deleterious for the agroecosystem  
**[0:03:17-0:03:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  and we destroy fauna filaments.  
**[0:03:20-0:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:20):**  And these filaments are extremely important because they are a kind of concrete between  
**[0:03:28-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:28):**  soil and the other elements.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  So a sustainable soil which of fungal hyphae can resist erosion, can resist runoff to soil  
**[0:03:43-0:03:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  losses.  
**[0:03:44-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:44):**  And so there are a wide range of benefits.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  All these benefits impact on soil biodiversity, soil organisms, especially the microfauna  
**[0:03:58-0:04:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:58):**  like healthworms, ants, beetles, for example.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:04):**  And this fauna contributes to the soil fertility, to the biological soil fertility.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:12):**  And they also affect the physical status of a soil because it increases macro porosity.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:18):**  And if we increase macro porosity, we also increase water retention, we increase soil  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:25):**  gases and oxygen so the soil is well aerated, rich of oxygen.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:34):**  And we avoid the proliferation of deleterious bacteria like the netrifying bacteria that  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:43):**  are abundant in asphyctic soils.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:49):**  When you look at no-till versus minimum-till, no-till would, I think you would say would  
**[0:04:58-0:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:58):**  be better than minimum-till, how would you define minimum-till?  
**[0:05:06-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:06):**  I can give example from our system, the olive orchard we are talking about.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  No-till is completely, it's a soil without any tillage.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  But sometimes minimum-till is necessary.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  For example, when the pruning residues or the crop residues from cover crops are cut,  
**[0:05:36-0:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:36):**  they must be incorporated into the soil.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:39):**  So sometimes, and we have to cut this because for example cover crops compete with plants  
**[0:05:49-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  for water because water is a limiting factor in our environments.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  So they must be cut.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:57):**  When they are cut, they must be incorporated into the soil.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:02):**  So sometimes a light harrowing is incorporated into the soil.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:08):**  A tillage up to 10 centimetres is needed or 5 to 10 centimetres to incorporate this organic  
**[0:06:18-0:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  matter into the soil and following the process of humification.  
**[0:06:30-0:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:30):**  If you look at the soil profile, so here, you have surface and then you have below the  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:39):**  soil.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  If you're only tilling 5 to 10, you're up here.  
**[0:06:45-0:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  And then traditional tillage you're saying could go down to 30.  
**[0:06:51-0:07:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:51):**  What band of the soil profile do you think plays the greatest role when it comes to agronomy  
**[0:07:01-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:01):**  of growing crops?  
**[0:07:03-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  In other words, is there one band of this soil that you really do not want to disturb  
**[0:07:09-0:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:09):**  where a lot of the organisms are, where a lot of the action is taking place?  
**[0:07:14-0:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:14):**  So is that why it's only 5 to 10 centimetres deep because that band isn't as important  
**[0:07:22-0:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:22):**  as say 10 to 30?  
**[0:07:27-0:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:27):**  From my experience and considering our experimental fields, our fields are in arid environments.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  So the first centimetres of soils usually are not so wet, like the band from 10 to 30  
**[0:07:53-0:07:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  centimetres.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:54):**  And most of the soil moisture is in that band between 10 and 25 to 30 centimetres.  
**[0:08:06-0:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  But also, most of the biodiversity, if the soil is not disturbed, of course, and of macrofauna,  
**[0:08:15-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:15):**  biodiversity is in that band.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  So mostly it depends also on irrigation, of the irrigation type.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  If the soil is an orchard is drip irrigated, irrigated with microjets, or just applying  
**[0:08:40-0:08:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  water, the whole surface.  
**[0:08:45-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:45):**  And of course, another part very rich in biodiversity is the rhizosphere.  
**[0:08:50-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  So it is the, independently from the depth of soil is the area close to the root surface.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  So I think that if we apply minimum tillage, there is not a big damage, even because many  
**[0:09:12-0:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  soil organisms live not in the litter, but in the layer between 15, 10, 15, 30, 40 maximum  
**[0:09:26-0:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:26):**  centimetres, many healthworms, for example.  
**[0:09:33-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:33):**  If you're in an arid environment and you have that band of soil at the top, that it kind  
**[0:09:40-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  of acts like a mulch, right?  
**[0:09:41-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  It dries out and it prevents transpiration directly from the wet to the atmosphere.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  If you had that cover crop growing and you cut the cover crop and you just let it lay  
**[0:09:55-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  on soil surface, instead of integrating it in, and you move that wet band up higher directly  
**[0:10:06-0:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  to soil surface, is there a benefit to that?  
**[0:10:12-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:12):**  Is there a benefit to having a complete organic matter cover litter over the whole surface  
**[0:10:19-0:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  versus a more bare surface with that dry band?  
**[0:10:27-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  So you mean the difference between incorporating the organic matter applied into the soil,  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  the first layer of soil, or let it on the surface?  
**[0:10:39-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:39):**  Yes.  
**[0:10:40-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  There are benefits and it depends.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:45):**  Of course, if we leave the organic matter from pruning residues from cover crops on  
**[0:10:52-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  the surface, we have benefits because we reduce transpiration, we reduce erosion and we don't  
**[0:11:04-0:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  disturb at all the soil.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:07):**  So microorganisms are very well preserved.  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:12):**  But the mineralization of this organic matter is lower.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  So we need time.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  So this is a good option if we combine the residues kept on onto the soil, above the  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:32):**  soil, together with mineral fertilization.  
**[0:11:37-0:11:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:37):**  But if you want to produce humus and let that nutrients are released from organic matter,  
**[0:11:50-0:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:50):**  we need to incorporate it into the soil, at least in the first centimetres.  
**[0:11:54-0:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:54):**  Because in the soil we have much more than in the litter, we have the highest biological  
**[0:12:05-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:05):**  activity.  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:06):**  And another important factor is the surface to mass ratio.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  So it is very important, at least in our climate, to reduce, to increase the surface of the  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  organic matter.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  So we have to shred the leaves and pruning residues and everything.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:31):**  And this allows microorganisms to decompose fastly into the organic matter.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:41):**  And it also depends, the choice depends also on the water content and on the irrigation  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  type.  
**[0:12:49-0:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  If the water content is high, we can leave the organic matter above the soil, like a  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:00):**  cover, kind of cover onto the soil.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:04):**  If the soil is dry, it is better to incorporate the organic matter, the residues in the first  
**[0:13:11-0:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  centimetres where the activity of microorganism is higher due to water content.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:19):**  So the choice depends mostly on the climate and on the irrigation type.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:29):**  If you were in a lab setting and you had two pots and one had, let's say they're one metre  
**[0:13:40-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  deep pots, and you had one where it had a 10 centimetre band of dry soil at the top  
**[0:13:49-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:49):**  and you put plant A in that pot, the next pot, same depth, same plant goes in, but soil  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  was wet, like you ensured that soil was wet directly to soil surface.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  Do you think you'd see a difference in plant health in the soil that was moist, the 100%  
**[0:14:13-0:14:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13):**  of the soil profile versus one that was only moist, some level below the surface?  
**[0:14:19-0:14:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:19):**  Yeah, also in this case, it depends on the crop.  
**[0:14:26-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:26):**  I have experience with orchards, so with tree crops, and what did I learn from these systems  
**[0:14:35-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:35):**  that of course we have compared to herbaceous crops, we have deeper root systems.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  But also in this case, the situation changes according to the crop.  
**[0:14:55-0:15:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:55):**  For example, if we compare two extremes, so if we compare olive trees, a typical crop  
**[0:15:03-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:03):**  from our environments, our climates, our soils, and kiwifruit, for example, that is also cultivated  
**[0:15:15-0:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  in our systems, we have two completely different behaviours.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:21):**  The root systems of olive trees are very deep, up to 2, 3, 4 metres.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:32):**  So the absorption of water is mainly concentrated in below 50 centimetres and more.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  So in that case, irrigation is quite important.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:48):**  For example, drip irrigation, so concentrating irrigation just in the soil were explored  
**[0:15:57-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:57):**  by roots and let this water get down, go down, so the water must have the time to arrive  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11):**  to the deepest layers of the soil.  
**[0:16:16-0:16:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:16):**  At this end, for olive, for example, we have very high water use efficiency and they can  
**[0:16:25-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:25):**  resist to very low water potential, so very low amount of water into the soil.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  If we compare this crop with kiwifruit, for example, the roots morphology and system is  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:39):**  totally different.  
**[0:16:41-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:41):**  And kiwifruit has a shell of system, so the roots develop in the first layer of the soil  
**[0:16:53-0:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  and they explore the first layer up to maximum 30, 35 centimetres, not more.  
**[0:17:02-0:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:02):**  So if we cultivate, for example, olive in soil with a dry layer, the top, dry top soil,  
**[0:17:11-0:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:11):**  doesn't matter.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:13):**  It is not so important.  
**[0:17:16-0:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:16):**  If we cultivate kiwifruit, it is very, very important.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:22):**  So it mostly depends on, also in this case, on the crop, on the tree crop and on the irrigation  
**[0:17:29-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:29):**  system that it is applied according to the crop that is cultivated.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  Yeah, so most people listening to this are going to be growing herbaceous crops, vegetables,  
**[0:17:44-0:17:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:44):**  and I would think they'd be in the, they'd be closer aligned to kiwi than olives.  
**[0:17:52-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:52):**  So for vegetables, also in this case, I did some researches about them and the root morphology  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:00):**  and root architecture is very, very important also in this case.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:05):**  So if we cultivate, for example, cabbage or rapeseed that belong to brassica, family,  
**[0:18:16-0:18:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:16):**  they have a taproot, so a very long root, deep into the soil.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:25):**  So in that case, they are less affected by dry top soil.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:30):**  If we cultivate, or cereals is the same, if you cultivate other crops, like legumes, for  
**[0:18:39-0:18:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:39):**  example, they have more diffuse root system, so not a taproot system.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:46):**  And so they are more influenced by the moisture in the top soil.  
**[0:18:55-0:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  I know you did a study looking at different forms of irrigation and you've alluded to  
**[0:19:00-0:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  this a little bit.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:02):**  The most common forms of irrigation here in the States would be drip and then just overhead  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:10):**  sprinkler.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  So when I think about the two, and I guess microjets are going to be similar to an overhead  
**[0:19:18-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:18):**  in terms of coverage.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  When I think of drip, you get a concentration on one point of the soil and then you get  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:24):**  it, it kind of bubbles out over time.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:27):**  When you get a microjet or sprinkler, it's like rain, you're applying it evenly over  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  the surface.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:33):**  How should growers think about irrigation systems and the differences between a microjet  
**[0:19:41-0:19:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:41):**  or overhead versus drip and how that could affect plant growth?  
**[0:19:47-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:47):**  Firstly, the most important thing is the efficiency of these systems.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  Drip irrigation is very efficient, so the amount of water is required is very, very  
**[0:20:03-0:20:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:03):**  low compared to the microjets.  
**[0:20:08-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:08):**  For drip irrigation, we use them in several agro ecosystems, for several crops, especially  
**[0:20:15-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  for tree crops, for peach, for example, for nectarines, for olive.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  And it is very, very efficient and we cover on average 20% of the soil surface.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:36):**  This system has many advantages from an environmental point of view because the wet soil is less.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:48):**  And in the wet soil, we have the highest losses of carbon as carbon dioxide because soil respiration  
**[0:20:57-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:57):**  is very, very high.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  So we have losses of carbon and losses of organic carbon, but concentrated just where  
**[0:21:07-0:21:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:07):**  the drip system is located.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:15):**  If we apply microjets, of course, we must use much more water.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  The efficiency is 65-75% and we can cover almost the whole soil.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  And also in this case, it depends on the crop.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:37):**  It depends on the root system.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  So the choice of an irrigation system is based mainly on the water availability, firstly,  
**[0:21:49-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  but especially on the architecture and morphology of the roots of the crop.  
**[0:21:56-0:22:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:56):**  So if a crop, if a root is concentrated, is below the plant, is a taproot, is along the  
**[0:22:02-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:02):**  soil profile, it is deep.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  A drip irrigation can be fine.  
**[0:22:10-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:10):**  The roots are shallow or they are concentrated in the first layers of the soil.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  In that case, microjets are preferred.  
**[0:22:26-0:22:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:26):**  And also in this case, from my experience, we have crops that need microjets.  
**[0:22:37-0:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:37):**  For example, kiwifruit is like that.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:40):**  And other ones that are better with drip irrigation.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  With drip irrigation, we have many environmental benefits and economical benefits.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:53):**  So in thinking about that, I mean, that makes sense.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  If the crops that get most of their benefit in the upper soil profile, then you want that  
**[0:23:03-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:03):**  to be as wet as possible because that's where their roots are.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  That's where you want biological activity.  
**[0:23:08-0:23:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:08):**  If the plants are going deeper with their roots, then drip's okay because the water's  
**[0:23:14-0:23:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:14):**  just going down, down, and it's not covering as much of that upper band.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:18):**  That's the basic gist of it?  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:21):**  That's the basic reason or the choice.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:25):**  And of course, mostly depends on the water availability in the place where you cultivate.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:33):**  And in fact, drip irrigation was discovered and applied in Israel, for example.  
**[0:23:39-0:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:39):**  They are expert in this, but now it is spread in all the Mediterranean basin for tree crops,  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:45):**  for example.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:47):**  So always it depends on the crop and on the crop density and the water availability, the  
**[0:23:53-0:23:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  choice.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:54):**  So it is not a matter of arid or wet climate, but it depends on the density and on the root  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  morphology.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  Does tillage play a role in soil drying out?  
**[0:24:16-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  If you had an area that had a nice moisture profile on the soil and I till it, is that  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  soil going to want to dry out faster now?  
**[0:24:32-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:32):**  Mostly depends on the soil composition, if it is a sandy soil or a clay soil.  
**[0:24:43-0:24:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:43):**  And usually if we till, we have, in most of the cases, we have lots of water from the  
**[0:24:52-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:52):**  top soil and a higher mineralization.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  So we have losses of water and of carbon at the same time.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:02):**  And another danger is that if we plough or we till, we can have soil compaction.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:15):**  So we have a loss of water and carbon from the top layer.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:21):**  And at the same time, we have compaction or in the worst case, seeding of the soil and  
**[0:25:29-0:25:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:29):**  deeper layers.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:34):**  And so I was reading yesterday that most of the most fertile soils cultivated lost from  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:49):**  20 to 60% of organic carbon in 50 years.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  The prairie soils, the most fertile soils.  
**[0:25:58-0:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:58):**  And in Germany, where I am actually, we have losses of 60 hectares per day of soil.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:06):**  60 hectares every day.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:11):**  And of soil seeding, so a soil that is completely lost forever.  
**[0:26:17-0:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  And Italy, where I come from, where I work, is the European country with the highest consume  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:25):**  of soil.  
**[0:26:28-0:26:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:28):**  We lost in the tilled soils, we lost 100 times more soil by erosion compared to the sustainable  
**[0:26:40-0:26:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:40):**  soils.  
**[0:26:41-0:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:41):**  So the erosion is 100 times faster.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:44):**  And this is very similar to the results that we had in our systems.  
**[0:26:54-0:27:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:54):**  When you read this, you're doing research, and this is over, like you said, a medium  
**[0:27:01-0:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:01):**  long term, 20 year study.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:05):**  Why isn't sustainable agriculture viewed as a better option for people doing the farming?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  Why does conventional still hold so much clout?  
**[0:27:23-0:27:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:23):**  When the data seems to show that one is clearly better, not just for now, but for the future?  
**[0:27:35-0:27:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:35):**  This is a very interesting question and very complex.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:42):**  Because we, I think because we, at least me, I work in academic.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:54):**  And so among the researchers, these things are very well known.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:00):**  If we look, if we read the FAO reports, the IPCC reports, and other reports, all of them  
**[0:28:10-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:10):**  say that soil is important, not only for a productive point of view, but from an economical  
**[0:28:21-0:28:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  and environmental point of view.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:25):**  And the environment today is extremely important.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:27):**  We are looking at the effects of climate change.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:32):**  And we don't often we don't think that soil contains the amount of carbon, the atmosphere,  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  and the biosphere at the same time.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:49):**  So the carbon stocks in the soil are very important.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:53):**  And so carbon can be a sink for soil for carbon.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  So it can be a sink for carbon.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:00):**  But the problem is, at least in the country where I live and I work, is the dissemination  
**[0:29:06-0:29:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:06):**  of this message to farmers.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:09):**  Other things are changing very fastly.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  The last years, the integrated agriculture, the regenerative agriculture, the organic  
**[0:29:18-0:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:18):**  agriculture increased a lot.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:21):**  And organic production in Italy is today very high compared to 20 years ago or 30 years  
**[0:29:30-0:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  ago.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:31):**  So the message the message are arriving, but there is a kind of we need time.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  Time is needed to transmit this knowledge to the young generation, to the young farmers.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:43):**  Many of the young farmers that are starting to cultivate you, especially after the crisis  
**[0:29:51-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:51):**  economic crisis, they decide to be farmers have a degree.  
**[0:29:57-0:30:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  They have studied so they know these things.  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:02):**  While the traditional farmers of course are more ignorant.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  So they often they did cannot receive the message behind these new practices.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  So I think that we must focus especially academia, universities, research centers on the communication  
**[0:30:25-0:30:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:25):**  and dissemination starting from the children.  
**[0:30:32-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:32):**  So I think that the reason why the sustainable techniques, eco-friendly techniques, there  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  are several names, but the substance is always the same.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:44):**  The reason why they are not applied is that the concept we should transmit the message  
**[0:30:58-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:58):**  that agriculture is important.  
**[0:30:59-0:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  It's a multifunctional practice activity.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  It's not important only production, but it is also important to sustainability.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:09):**  So your soils must be fertile for a long time for many generations.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  And the benefits don't be that must not be immediate, but they must last during time.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:28):**  And most difficulties and understanding for the farmers is understanding the importance  
**[0:31:40-0:31:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:40):**  of their activity for the environment, the importance of the soil management on the environment.  
**[0:31:49-0:31:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:49):**  But today the things are going much better than 20 years ago.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:52):**  There is a lot of research and a lot of revocation, dissemination.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:57):**  I look this is positive from a positive point of view.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:02):**  And did I hear you right that the soil holds as much carbon as the atmosphere and biosphere  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  combined?  
**[0:32:12-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  Soils have the same carbon of the atmosphere and the biosphere combined.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:23):**  And of course, the most important thing for carbon is water, oceans.  
**[0:32:34-0:32:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  And the oceans every day mitigate our effects, deleterious effects on the environment.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:41):**  They absorb a lot of carbon as carbonates.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:44):**  But soil after oceans, soils are the second sink of carbon in the world.  
**[0:32:53-0:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  In trying to build these complex soils that can sink carbon and all for getting kids involved  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  early, I mean, when you start to look at some of the macrofauna, I mean, that's where I  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:05):**  think kids can see that it's not something you need a microscope for.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:09):**  They get it.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  Can you talk about the importance of soil macrofauna and maybe even start out saying,  
**[0:33:18-0:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  define what is macrofauna?  
**[0:33:20-0:33:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  Because I think people take macrofauna in the soil for granted and microfauna get all  
**[0:33:28-0:33:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:28):**  the credit and all the kind of the popularity.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:31):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  So the scientific definition of microfauna is animals below 100 microns.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:44):**  One micron is one million of a meter.  
**[0:33:49-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  And for mesofauna, we define organelles between 100 and 100 meters, microns and two millimeters.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  For macrofauna, we can imagine earthworms, for example, or insects.  
**[0:34:10-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:10):**  We define animals, soil animals from two millimeters to 20 millimeters.  
**[0:34:19-0:34:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  And then we have megafauna, the animals that are visible, the more evident animals that  
**[0:34:26-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:26):**  are above 20 millimeters.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  And in addition, we have another definition very common to find is microflora is scientifically  
**[0:34:41-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:41):**  is quite wrong because it's not a flora.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  They are not plants, but they are bacteria and fungi.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:50):**  And so we have these four components that work all together in the soil.  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:58):**  So we can see the soil, we should imagine the soil not from only a productive point  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:03):**  of view, but under an holistic vision.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  So the holistic vision, there are several researchers, recent researchers that explore  
**[0:35:17-0:35:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:17):**  the soil, not only from a mineral point of view, but also from a biological point of  
**[0:35:25-0:35:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:25):**  view.  
**[0:35:26-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:26):**  In a soil, there are minerals, there is organic matter, there are animals, there are bacteria,  
**[0:35:33-0:35:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  there are fungi, there are microorganisms.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:36):**  And of course, there are also pores, pores filled with water and air.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  So soil is a living system.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  It is not something that it is not some is not something where organic matter only decomposes,  
**[0:35:59-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:59):**  but it is something alive.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  And if we may imagine that 25% of biodiversity is in the soil, 24, one quarter of biodiversity  
**[0:36:15-0:36:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  is in the soil.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:17):**  And most of this biodiversity is not known at all.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:22):**  If we imagine that ants constitute the 10% of the biomass of the all animals or together,  
**[0:36:34-0:36:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:34):**  we can have an idea of the importance of soil from a biological point of view.  
**[0:36:40-0:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:40):**  Of course, from a scientific point of view, scientific point of view, soils can be considered  
**[0:36:47-0:36:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:47):**  as soils, even if there is no life in it.  
**[0:36:53-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:53):**  We talk about soils from Mars, for example, planets, soils from deserts, where there is  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  no life, there is little life.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:03):**  But most of the cases, soils are alive.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  There is cooperation between microorganisms, plant, roots, animals, and sofona.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:16):**  And that work all together in soil composition.  
**[0:37:22-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  And I have I had a lesson from a very important for me, in my opinion, Italian pedologist,  
**[0:37:36-0:37:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  maybe not very well known, is Giovanni Haussmann.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:42):**  He considered the soil as a placenta, I'm reading now.  
**[0:37:46-0:37:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:46):**  And what he said, the man who physically and culturally is far from nature environment,  
**[0:37:53-0:38:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:53):**  from the soil, from agriculture and tradition, can be considered as eradicated, alienated,  
**[0:38:00-0:38:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:00):**  confused, capable of only damaging himself to others and to the environment.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  So soil can be, must be, look, so seen as a living ecosystem.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:20):**  And all the production depends, 90% of life depends on soil.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  The macro fauna in the soil, so that would be worms, ants, beetles.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  What role are they playing in all of this?  
**[0:38:42-0:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:42):**  Let's start with worms.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:45):**  The most important, they have several roles.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  And most of these roles are beneficial from soil.  
**[0:38:57-0:39:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:57):**  And earthworms, for example, termites, ants, some beetles can be defined as ecosystem engineers.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:09):**  Why this definition?  
**[0:39:11-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:11):**  Because they dig into the soil, they build nests, burrows, and they mix organic matter.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  So they are like engineers.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  They change physically and chemically the soil.  
**[0:39:31-0:39:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:31):**  So they increase macro porosity.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:35):**  So the soil with macro fauna are usually richer of air, of oxygen.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:45):**  And they shred organic matter, leaves, and so residues, and they increase the surface  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:55):**  of this organic matter, organic material.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:58):**  Increasing the surface of this material, microorganisms of bacteria and fungi can decompose better  
**[0:40:03-0:40:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  this material.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:07):**  And so if they decompose better, more nutrients are released, more nitrogen, more phosphorus,  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  potassium.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:17):**  And so plants can absorb more nutrients.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:21):**  So soil fertility increases.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:24):**  So it's a kind of trophic net where you have the producers that are roots, their plants,  
**[0:40:34-0:40:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:34):**  photosynthetic organisms, and then you have the shredders.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:40):**  Macro fauna usually do this.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:41):**  So they cut organic material in smaller pieces.  
**[0:40:48-0:40:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:48):**  And then you have the decomposers that are mostly microorganisms.  
**[0:40:54-0:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:54):**  So macro faunas are a very important role because they, macro fauna, live in the soil,  
**[0:41:06-0:41:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:06):**  usually in the top soil.  
**[0:41:08-0:41:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:08):**  But most of organisms are concentrated in the litter, but some of them can live in the  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:17):**  deeper soil.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:20):**  So the main advantage is the physical changes that macro fauna causes in the soil.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  And these physical changes in turn can affect chemical fertility and biological fertility  
**[0:41:40-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:40):**  of microorganisms.  
**[0:41:43-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  So everything is interconnected, intertwined.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  If you think about ants, I don't think they get any credit, at least with the, even gardeners,  
**[0:41:57-0:41:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:57):**  when it comes to building soil.  
**[0:41:58-0:42:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:58):**  I think worms get all the credit.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:02):**  What role do ants play?  
**[0:42:05-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:05):**  And hearing that quote that ants are what, 10% of biomass?  
**[0:42:14-0:42:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  There's a lot of ants.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:16):**  What are they doing in the soil?  
**[0:42:19-0:42:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:19):**  Ants are, usually ants are concentrated in the hot environments.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:26):**  So in the arid environments, much more than in the coldest part environments.  
**[0:42:35-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:35):**  But ants are ecosystem engineers.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  They protect, so they change the physical structure of the soil.  
**[0:42:46-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:46):**  They are very strong predators of pathogens of other organisms that eat plants.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  So they are competitor of herbivores, for example.  
**[0:43:09-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:09):**  So they can protect plants from other organisms.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:15):**  And they can protect roots from damaging insects.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:23):**  They can change the, with their nests, they can change the physical structure of the soil.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  So they can increase water infiltration and water holding capacity.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:40):**  And so in arid soil, you must, for example, irrigate less.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:48):**  So you have benefits because your soils are richer of water.  
**[0:43:54-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:54):**  So all these microtome faunal organisms are not dangerous for plants.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:06):**  If you look at ants versus earthworms, if they were in the same environment, do you  
**[0:44:15-0:44:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  have a sense of which one does more in terms of aeration, creating micro-porosity?  
**[0:44:22-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:22):**  Is it worms or is it ants?  
**[0:44:29-0:44:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  Both are, they are quite similar from certain point of view for the sides, more or less.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:38):**  And they are part of the microfauna.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:42):**  They can be defined microfauna.  
**[0:44:46-0:44:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:46):**  But their functions are totally different.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:49):**  Earthworms are more abundant in the wet soils.  
**[0:44:52-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:52):**  So they need more water.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  And ants are more abundant in the dry soils.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  Both are ecosystem engineers.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  So they change the structure of the soil.  
**[0:45:06-0:45:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:06):**  But there is a difference because usually ants eat sugars.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:12):**  So they have different, they eat differently.  
**[0:45:19-0:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:19):**  While earthworms eat soil.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  So eating soil, they mix this soil with the enzymes of their gut, their stomach, and then  
**[0:45:32-0:45:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:32):**  excrete the soil, the same soil, enriched of enzymes, enriched of other organic matter.  
**[0:45:41-0:45:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:41):**  So the castes of these earthworms constitute a very fertile soil.  
**[0:45:48-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:48):**  So the earthworms are clove soils.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  And so they mix the organic matter.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  And they cause the bioturbation.  
**[0:46:00-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:00):**  The bioturbation is the change of the soil, the physical structure of the soil.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  They mix, for example, they transport the fertile soil, the top soil, to the deeper  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  layers of soil.  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  So they increase also the fertility of the deeper soil.  
**[0:46:20-0:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:20):**  And they increase aeration.  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:24):**  They increase biological activity.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  They enrich soil with enzymes.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  Ants are different.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  Of course, they can physically, can change the physical structure of the soil, but are  
**[0:46:41-0:46:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:41):**  not so efficient like earthworms.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:45):**  And this is also why Darwin spent the last years of his life studying macrofauna, studying  
**[0:46:55-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  earthworms.  
**[0:46:56-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  He wrote a book on this.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  If somebody wanted to increase the number of earthworms in their soil, is it as simple  
**[0:47:10-0:47:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:10):**  as add organic matter and moisture?  
**[0:47:16-0:47:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:16):**  Simple yeah.  
**[0:47:17-0:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:17):**  Earthworms are not so, not so efficient.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:26):**  They don't require much.  
**[0:47:28-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  But they, for sure, they need water and organic matter.  
**[0:47:34-0:47:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:34):**  They live in the organic, decaying organic matter.  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:37):**  They compost organic matter.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  And at the same time, you need for sure water.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:44):**  So these two things are important for their growth.  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:51):**  And of course, you can enrich soil.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:54):**  You can also buy earthworms and increase the earthworm activity and earthworms abundance  
**[0:48:05-0:48:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:05):**  and numbering your soils.  
**[0:48:08-0:48:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:08):**  It's a practice that is normally used to increase by adding earthworms to the soil.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:15):**  But you must prepare the conditions for their growth.  
**[0:48:23-0:48:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:23):**  But in this case, it also depends on the species of earthworms.  
**[0:48:31-0:48:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:31):**  Some species of earthworms live in the litter.  
**[0:48:35-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:35):**  Other ones in the top soil, other ones go deeper.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  So if we want to increase earthworms, I think the best way to do is not adding by yourself,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:52):**  because it is very difficult, hard, because especially if you have big lands, big soil  
**[0:48:59-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:59):**  surface, you will need so many earthworms, but it is avoid tillage, increase organic  
**[0:49:10-0:49:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:10):**  matter and increase water, if possible.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:14):**  These are the three conditions.  
**[0:49:17-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:17):**  Because earthworms per tubes change physical structure of the soil.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  They mix the soil, but of course, they can be reduced if the soil is stilled.  
**[0:49:35-0:49:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:35):**  When you look at increasing porosity in the soil through macrofauna, they're digging all  
**[0:49:43-0:49:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:43):**  these tunnels, allowing air and water to get into the soil.  
**[0:49:49-0:49:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:49):**  That's one of the reasons we try and do tillage, or we do tillage, is to try and recreate that.  
**[0:49:56-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:56):**  We take a dense soil and we want to fluff it up.  
**[0:49:59-0:50:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:59):**  But we know when we do tillage, you do that and it deflates, it collapses.  
**[0:50:07-0:50:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:07):**  Why don't the tunnels and all this activity from macrofauna, why is there no collapse  
**[0:50:14-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:14):**  from that?  
**[0:50:15-0:50:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  Yeah, that's a very, very good question.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:20):**  I think that tillage is a very strong practice.  
**[0:50:27-0:50:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  So it disturbs the soil completely and it destroys the macro aggregates of the soil  
**[0:50:40-0:50:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:40):**  and the physical structure of the soil.  
**[0:50:43-0:50:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:43):**  So the main reason why we till is not improving the soil fertility or soil aeration, but eliminating  
**[0:50:59-0:51:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:59):**  weeds.  
**[0:51:03-0:51:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:03):**  So if we want to eradicate plants, we till.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:09):**  If we want to have the soil bare, completely bare, we till.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:15):**  So it is a very easy practice to apply.  
**[0:51:20-0:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:20):**  So we usually till the soil because it is simple.  
**[0:51:28-0:51:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  On the other side, the activity of macrofauna is completely different.  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:33):**  It is not so intense like tillage.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:37):**  It is distributed in different layers of the soil.  
**[0:51:43-0:51:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  So there is a kind of equilibrium.  
**[0:51:46-0:52:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  So if we think that the evolution of this organism, we can imagine why they are called  
**[0:52:02-0:52:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:02):**  engineers.  
**[0:52:03-0:52:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:03):**  They are called engineers because they know, not in a conscious way, of course, they know  
**[0:52:08-0:52:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:08):**  the limits of the soil.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:11):**  So they know how to build, they know the density of the nests, the density of the tunnels.  
**[0:52:20-0:52:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:20):**  They are in equilibrium with the soil and they act in a long term.  
**[0:52:28-0:52:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:28):**  So it is not like tillage, it is like ploughing.  
**[0:52:33-0:52:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:33):**  It is an intense and strong practice that disturb and destroy completely, firstly the  
**[0:52:47-0:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:47):**  physical structure of the soil, but after the physical changes, we have also the chemical  
**[0:52:55-0:52:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:55):**  changes.  
**[0:52:56-0:53:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:56):**  And after the chemical changes, we have a decrease of the biological fertility and we  
**[0:53:03-0:53:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:03):**  expose the soils to oxidation, to the oxygen.  
**[0:53:08-0:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:08):**  So we have a very high mineralization and it has sense only combined with mineral fertilization.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:17):**  While the fertilization carried out by microfauna is completely sustainable, it doesn't require  
**[0:53:28-0:53:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:28):**  external inputs.  
**[0:53:30-0:53:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:30):**  I think that if we till the soil, apparently we increase aeration in the first layers,  
**[0:53:39-0:53:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:39):**  but at the same time we pose compassion in the layers below.  
**[0:53:52-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:52):**  In many Italian soils, after 20, 30 years of intensive cultivation, we have very severe  
**[0:54:04-0:54:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  problems with soil quality.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:08):**  Many of our soils are compacted after 20 years of tillage, 20 years of mineral fertilization,  
**[0:54:17-0:54:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:17):**  20 years of decrease of organic matter, 20 years of decreasing biodiversity.  
**[0:54:31-0:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:31):**  So apparently if we want to act faster, we plough till the soil and we increase aeration  
**[0:54:36-0:54:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:36):**  of course, but at the same time we don't know other secondary effects of tillage.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:45):**  In the subsoils, many often I observe the soil compaction that starts from 40 centimeters  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:56):**  of soil.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  So many farmers try to avoid the detrimental effects of the decreasing soil fertility by  
**[0:55:09-0:55:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:09):**  increasing soil mineral fertilization, water supply, so they irrigate more, they put more  
**[0:55:19-0:55:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:19):**  nutrients, more fertilizers, trying to save plants, to save crops.  
**[0:55:25-0:55:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:25):**  Because they only concentrate their attention on the first layer of soil.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:31):**  They often don't know that soils below 30, 40 centimeters, 50 centimeters are completely  
**[0:55:40-0:55:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:40):**  compacted.  
**[0:55:43-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:43):**  So if we till a soil for a long time, of course we have an increase of soil aeration, but  
**[0:55:49-0:55:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  it is often just apparent, it is not like that.  
**[0:55:58-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:58):**  The situation is totally different in the deeper layers of the soil, where aeration  
**[0:56:04-0:56:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:04):**  is very, very low.  
**[0:56:08-0:56:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:08):**  In many soils, also recently in the trials that we are conducting, I observed compacted  
**[0:56:16-0:56:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:16):**  soils without macropose.  
**[0:56:20-0:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:20):**  They are the increases of carbon dioxide and they are normal because there is a soil breath.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:33):**  But the differences with sustainable soil are very, very high.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:39):**  So the physical damage of the soil decreases their fertility.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  So if you didn't turn the soil and you had compaction, let's say you had compaction to  
**[0:57:01-0:57:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:01):**  start, and you want to speed it up, to speed up the reversal of the compaction.  
**[0:57:07-0:57:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:07):**  If you ran a subsoil plow through there that didn't invert, it just helped break up that  
**[0:57:15-0:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:15):**  compaction from below, do you think that is a path worth looking at?  
**[0:57:24-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:24):**  Is that a tool in the toolkit, I guess is a better way to say it, to move towards something  
**[0:57:29-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  more regenerative or do you think that it is just not needed at all?  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:37):**  Yes, maybe you mean soil rippers.  
**[0:57:42-0:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:42):**  So kind of like a ripper.  
**[0:57:47-0:57:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:47):**  In many cases, this is very effective.  
**[0:57:50-0:57:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:50):**  So rippers are very effective because they don't disturb the soil, soil layers, they  
**[0:57:56-0:58:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:56):**  don't mix the soil, they don't expose the soil to oxidation, but they increase aeration  
**[0:58:05-0:58:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:05):**  from the cracks they form.  
**[0:58:10-0:58:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:10):**  And this is a good method, especially for crops, for tree crops, when we want to regenerate  
**[0:58:17-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:17):**  the root system.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  If a soil is compacted, usually we have problems with roots because roots need oxygen for respiration.  
**[0:58:31-0:58:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:31):**  And if a soil is compacted, the oxygen content is quite low.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:37):**  So the roots start to decompose.  
**[0:58:41-0:58:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:41):**  What can we do in this case?  
**[0:58:42-0:58:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:42):**  We can use rippers to cut the dead roots and let them regenerate again, increasing soil  
**[0:58:49-0:58:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:49):**  aeration.  
**[0:58:51-0:59:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:51):**  So another good option is, for example, in tree crops, is the dealing the soil in the  
**[0:59:03-0:59:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:03):**  inter-row area, for example, and filling them with soil just not along the tree row, but  
**[0:59:10-0:59:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:10):**  in the inter-row areas and fill them with organic matter.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  So sacrifice some parts of the field and so working in those parts and filling them with  
**[0:59:27-0:59:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:27):**  organic matter, so increasing aeration because soil gases can diffuse both vertically and  
**[0:59:35-0:59:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:35):**  horizontally into the soil.  
**[0:59:37-0:59:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:37):**  Have you ever seen this tool, a broadfork?  
**[0:59:44-0:59:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:44):**  Yes, let me.  
**[0:59:47-0:59:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:47):**  I have never seen it, but no, I have never seen it.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:55):**  The theory would be, you push this down into the ground, this is on a small scale, like  
**[1:00:02-1:00:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:02):**  the farmer is standing on it, and then he pulls back on those poles and those forks  
**[1:00:08-1:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:08):**  slice or kind of cut up through the soil and you work your way down the field.  
**[1:00:14-1:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:14):**  Push it in, slice.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:18):**  So it's a way of, on a small scale, aerating the soil while not mixing the layers up.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:27):**  And I was just curious if you had any thoughts on that.  
**[1:00:32-1:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:32):**  I have never seen it, but I can understand the importance, the function.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:39):**  Of course it can increase aeration, but can it be applied in a productive field?  
**[1:00:52-1:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:52):**  I think it's so much library.  
**[1:00:55-1:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:55):**  It'd be very small scale.  
**[1:00:57-1:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:57):**  You'd have to ask.  
**[1:00:58-1:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:58):**  Small scale, in the permaculture, for example.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:01):**  Yeah, at small scales, yeah.  
**[1:01:03-1:01:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:03):**  I guess coming to this then, what do you think, if you had restored soils using regenerative  
**[1:01:13-1:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:13):**  practices, do you think you'd ever need to do anything to the subsoil?  
**[1:01:19-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:19):**  And you just say, hey, let the roots, let the macrofauna, they'll do it.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  Once you get your soil to a certain point, is there like a point of, you never have to  
**[1:01:32-1:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:32):**  do soil, you never have to do subsoiling, you never have to do a ripper because the  
**[1:01:40-1:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:40):**  soil's nature is taking care of that?  
**[1:01:44-1:01:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:44):**  Or do you think there always is a need to some extent, to some degree, to go back and  
**[1:01:51-1:01:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:51):**  maybe have to do those types of activities?  
**[1:01:56-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:56):**  This is the principle of permaculture.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  So let the environment as it is.  
**[1:02:02-1:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:02):**  So in the productive crops, I think it's very difficult.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:08):**  So there is always something to do.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:13):**  It's very hard to let the things as they are.  
**[1:02:17-1:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:17):**  So it can be a disease, it can be a decrease of organic matter into the soil, so you have  
**[1:02:25-1:02:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:25):**  to increase organic matter and compost and the menu, or you have to contrast and disease  
**[1:02:33-1:02:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:33):**  a pathogen.  
**[1:02:35-1:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:35):**  So this equilibrium is not possible in agriculture, in the productive agriculture.  
**[1:02:45-1:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:45):**  Why?  
**[1:02:46-1:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:46):**  Because like I said before, agriculture is, agroecosystems are ecosystems, so of course  
**[1:02:54-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:54):**  they reach an equilibrium, but this equilibrium doesn't give benefit only to the crop, but  
**[1:03:02-1:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:02):**  to the whole community of organisms.  
**[1:03:07-1:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:07):**  And so in the productive agriculture, of course, there are less intensive organic practices  
**[1:03:17-1:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:17):**  that are, sometimes you can apply natural products and products are not, mineral fertilizers,  
**[1:03:34-1:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:34):**  for example, or chemical, not chemical, producing substances, but from time to time you for  
**[1:03:46-1:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:46):**  sure you have to do something.  
**[1:03:51-1:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:51):**  Different concept is in the permaculture where there is an ecological view where crops are  
**[1:04:01-1:04:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:01):**  not at the center of the ecosystem, but they compete naturally with other plants or animals,  
**[1:04:12-1:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:12):**  but you can do this at a small scale, but if we imagine that one third of the soils  
**[1:04:19-1:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:19):**  are lost, we lost one third of the fertile soils, so soils are becoming more important  
**[1:04:31-1:04:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:31):**  than water, they are a natural capital, and we are almost 8 billion inhabitants, food  
**[1:04:44-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:44):**  is not enough for everyone.  
**[1:04:47-1:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  So regenerative agriculture and sustainable agriculture is very important, but of course  
**[1:04:53-1:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:53):**  it requires labor.  
**[1:04:55-1:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:55):**  Right, so I'm maybe thinking of that in a practical sense for farmers, do as little  
**[1:05:07-1:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:07):**  as you need to do in terms of interfering, but at the end of the day you are producing  
**[1:05:13-1:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:13):**  a crop, you need that crop to grow well, so if you have to step in with certain practices,  
**[1:05:21-1:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:21):**  and do it, but there's always choices, one is more of a gentle approach, one is more  
**[1:05:29-1:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:29):**  of a harsh approach.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:31):**  Yeah, the gentle approach also requires knowledge, so you can act gently on the crops if you  
**[1:05:43-1:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:43):**  know how the agro-ecosystem works, how they function, so knowledge is very important.  
**[1:05:55-1:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:55):**  Sustainable agriculture, it is possible to apply sustainable agriculture, there is a  
**[1:06:01-1:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:01):**  lot of scientific knowledge on this, the problem is disseminating, transferring this information  
**[1:06:10-1:06:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:10):**  to the farmers.  
**[1:06:15-1:06:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:15):**  One area I'm thinking of now is organic matter, and obviously it's important on the small  
**[1:06:22-1:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:22):**  scale, a lot of farmers are adding organic matter to the soil with compost.  
**[1:06:27-1:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:27):**  If you had two scenarios, one would be, let's say I laid down 3 centimeters of compost directly  
**[1:06:34-1:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:34):**  on the soil surface, I didn't integrate it into the soil, I just layer it right on top.  
**[1:06:41-1:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:41):**  The next would be I put down that same 3 centimeters, but I mix it in to say the top 10 centimeters.  
**[1:06:50-1:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:50):**  Would the difference between those methods be in case one, it's going to mineralize slower,  
**[1:06:59-1:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:59):**  because I have to wait for the macro fauna to get it and bring it down, and I maybe prevent  
**[1:07:06-1:07:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:06):**  some evaporation because I now have this organic cap.  
**[1:07:11-1:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:11):**  And then in scenario two where I've mixed it in, I'm putting more food into that upper  
**[1:07:19-1:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:19):**  horizon of the soil so it's mineralizing faster.  
**[1:07:23-1:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:23):**  Is that really the only difference between the two, is it a mulching effect and a mineralization  
**[1:07:28-1:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:28):**  rate effect, or is there something else I'm missing from layering versus mixing?  
**[1:07:37-1:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:37):**  Of course if you don't mix the organic matter, you preserve soils entirely.  
**[1:07:44-1:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:44):**  So you don't disturb any macro fauna, you don't disturb animals, you don't disturb high  
**[1:07:53-1:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:53):**  feed, so it is not only mineralization, but if you don't incorporate the organic matter  
**[1:08:05-1:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:05):**  into the soil, you preserve biodiversity of the soil.  
**[1:08:11-1:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:11):**  So you preserve the ecological nice, the ecological habitats of many microorganisms and fauna,  
**[1:08:24-1:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:24):**  and soil fauna.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:26):**  So it has beneficial effects on soil biodiversity.  
**[1:08:32-1:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:32):**  This in turn gives also benefits to the agricultural production.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:38):**  If you preserve the fungal network, plants and crops of course can absorb much better  
**[1:08:46-1:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:46):**  nutrients, for example phosphorus, because the fungal filaments, the high field fungus,  
**[1:08:58-1:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:58):**  help plants to absorb nutrients.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:00):**  At the same time, many microorganisms produce exudates, also roots produce exudates, so  
**[1:09:12-1:09:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:12):**  substances that are separated from their bodies.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:17):**  And these substances can act as a kind of glue, so they preserve soil agarates and they  
**[1:09:28-1:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:28):**  keep them safe from erosion.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:33):**  So the situation of incorporating the residues into the soil is totally different because  
**[1:09:42-1:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:42):**  you destroy much of this biodiversity.  
**[1:09:47-1:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:47):**  From all your work studying systems, how would you define what sustainable agriculture is  
**[1:09:54-1:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:54):**  today?  
**[1:09:55-1:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:55):**  Sustainable agriculture is something that can last over time.  
**[1:10:02-1:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:02):**  So it requires of course life, biodiversity is extremely important for sustainability.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:13):**  If we don't want to intervene continuously on soils, we must accept that most of the  
**[1:10:23-1:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:23):**  work must be done by soil organisms.  
**[1:10:26-1:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:26):**  We don't have to reduce soil biodiversity.  
**[1:10:31-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:31):**  And sustainable agriculture is something that is regenerative, it is not necessarily organic,  
**[1:10:42-1:10:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  it is something that increases carbon into the soil, that increases biodiversity, it  
**[1:10:49-1:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:49):**  can be defined as restorative conservation agriculture, something that preserves soil,  
**[1:10:58-1:11:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:58):**  but soil is viewed as a living ecosystem where there is a kind of equilibrium.  
**[1:11:10-1:11:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:10):**  So we must preserve this equilibrium.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:16):**  What would you want farmers to know if you look at your research and thinking about the  
**[1:11:21-1:11:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:21):**  future?  
**[1:11:24-1:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:24):**  I think that farmers should know that they have a capital in their hands.  
**[1:11:38-1:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:38):**  They have precious things.  
**[1:11:42-1:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:42):**  They must preserve resources, preserve water, but not only water, considering the interactions  
**[1:11:52-1:12:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:52):**  between plants and soil, considering the importance of soil biodiversity, considering the soils  
**[1:12:00-1:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:00):**  as alive.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:04):**  So they should be convinced on this and for convincing them, it is important to know that  
**[1:12:18-1:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:18):**  environmental benefits can give economic benefits, economical benefits.  
**[1:12:26-1:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:26):**  So in the short term, conventional intensive agriculture can seem better, but in the long  
**[1:12:35-1:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:35):**  term, in a durable term, if we consider more years, a longer period, sustainable agriculture  
**[1:12:47-1:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:47):**  is more convenient from different point of view because soils not only give production,  
**[1:12:58-1:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:58):**  they are not only useful for production, but they are useful for a wide range of ecosystem  
**[1:13:04-1:13:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:04):**  services.  
**[1:13:05-1:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:05):**  They purify water, they purify atmosphere, they act as a sink of carbon, they can contrast  
**[1:13:11-1:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:11):**  climate change, they can store, preserve biodiversity in their layer, they can be extremely important,  
**[1:13:23-1:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:23):**  not only for production.  
**[1:13:25-1:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:25):**  So the responsibility of the new farmers, the young farmers is huge today.  
**[1:13:34-1:14:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:34):**  They can contribute to the future of the earth, of the planet.  
**[1:14:00-1:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-20-AdrianoSofo-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:00):**  Thank you.

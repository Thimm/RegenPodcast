### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 18 Aug 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Biochar.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  Is it worth the hype?  
**[0:00:23-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:23):**  That's what we're talking about in this episode of In Search of Soil with Dr. Kurt Spokas  
**[0:00:28-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  of the USDA.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  In this episode, we're going to be talking about the knowns of biochar because Dr. Spokas  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  has looked at a lot of these studies out there on biochar.  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  And today we're going to try and aggregate all of his knowledge and what he's seen in  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  those studies together to figure out what do we actually know about biochar?  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  Is it a net positive or is it just a big waste of time?  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:55):**  If you were ever on the fence about biochar in the past, I think this episode will help  
**[0:01:00-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:00):**  get you off the fence and firmly planted either in the side of I'm interested in that or I'll  
**[0:01:05-0:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  wait till we know more.  
**[0:01:08-0:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:08):**  So let's get into it.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:09):**  Biochar, the scientific knowns with Dr. Kurt Spokas.  
**[0:01:15-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:15):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:17-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  I was looking at some of your past presentations that you did about 10 years ago on biochar.  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  How has your knowledge in thinking about biochar changed based upon research and findings over  
**[0:01:31-0:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:31):**  the last decade or has it not changed?  
**[0:01:34-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:34):**  Well, it really hasn't changed that much.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:39):**  Despite the fact that we've added now 10 more years of research to our collective knowledge,  
**[0:01:45-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:45):**  there are still more questions than there are definitive answers.  
**[0:01:49-0:01:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  One particular comes down to the mechanisms behind what we see as the biochar effects.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:56):**  What are some of the big questions out there right now that still remain around biochar?  
**[0:02:02-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:02):**  Well, the biggest questions are fundamentally how it's working.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  When we see positive yield responses, when we see increases in soil fertility factors,  
**[0:02:13-0:02:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:13):**  what are the true mechanisms behind these positive effects that we've been seeing that  
**[0:02:20-0:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:20):**  are still the fundamental missing piece that we've been searching for?  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:27):**  What's the challenge at this point to answering that question?  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  Is it our understanding of soil microbiology?  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:36):**  Is it just there's a lot of variables at play here and it's hard to isolate them down?  
**[0:02:41-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:41):**  Why can't we answer that question?  
**[0:02:44-0:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  The biggest challenge is the soil itself, ignoring for biochar additions right now,  
**[0:02:51-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:51):**  soil itself is a very complex system.  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  It has so many other factors that come to play to make the productive soil besides the  
**[0:03:00-0:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:00):**  chemistry, biology, the plant physiology, the climate.  
**[0:03:05-0:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:05):**  We have a difficult time figuring out where biochar fits into this whole picture because  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:12):**  we don't know what mechanisms are at play.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  So we really don't know how to come up with a guidance yet based on a deficiency of the  
**[0:03:21-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  soil per se.  
**[0:03:23-0:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:23):**  We're getting closer to some of these things.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  We do know some of the positive attributes of soil moisture content.  
**[0:03:33-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:33):**  There's some physical changes to the structure, the packing of the soil, following additions.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  We've seen some alterations in the soil microbial relations, but putting all of those factors  
**[0:03:46-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:46):**  together in a predictive tool to say what will be after a particular biochar addition  
**[0:03:54-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:54):**  to a particular soil.  
**[0:03:56-0:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  We're still a ways from that.  
**[0:03:59-0:04:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:59):**  Is it something that you'd say right now we could view it as more of a positive than a  
**[0:04:05-0:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:05):**  negative even though we can't quantify how positive?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:10):**  Is it a plus or is it a minus or is it a neutral?  
**[0:04:17-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:17):**  It really boils down, if we look at the whole history of our biochar research that exists  
**[0:04:23-0:04:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:23):**  in the literature.  
**[0:04:24-0:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:24):**  We have about 50% of these studies show a positive effect, about 30% show no effect,  
**[0:04:32-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:32):**  and 20% are negative.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:34):**  So it really boils down to right now it's a kind of 50-50 statistical basis if we use  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  the entire suite of literature available.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:45):**  There are things that alter that, of course.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:48):**  If we know that the soil is deficient or if we're adding biochar to a highly acidic soil,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  we tend to see more positive effects for agricultural productivity.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:58):**  But those are isolated instances and we can't take that result and extrapolate it to all  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  agricultural soils.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:08):**  One thing I try and, or one way I try and think about biochar is this.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  At worst, you're sequestering carbon that is a byproduct from something, tree pruning,  
**[0:05:23-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:23):**  lumber scraps, the nut industry, and you're sequestering that carbon in the soil.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  And that inherently, like you mentioned, is going to change the tilth.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  There's going to be some moisture holding capacity to it.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:39):**  And if it only did that, that's your win.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  And I look at the negative of being, well, what did you have to put in to generate that?  
**[0:05:49-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  Meaning there's some time involved, there's some equipment involved, there's some costs  
**[0:05:53-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  involved.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  And if you can do that in a simple way, I see it as more positive than negative.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  Are there any negatives that I'm leaving out here that I'm missing, like ways that this  
**[0:06:09-0:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:09):**  could potentially hurt growth?  
**[0:06:12-0:06:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:12):**  There's the difficulty, there's been some isolated studies in literature that show that  
**[0:06:19-0:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:19):**  the biochar is created at an extremely low temperature, and you have a high amount of  
**[0:06:25-0:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:25):**  absorbed volatile organics from the paralysis, that that addition of that char has negative  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:32):**  impacts.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  But we do know those aspects of the negative char and the absorbed organics on there causing  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  these negative impacts.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  The more puzzling feature is what it's doing with the whole nutrient availability.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:49):**  There's still a lot of questions in terms of the long-term impact that this char could  
**[0:06:56-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:56):**  have on nutrient availability.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  It's been positive in some certain circumstances, but we've only measured it over a short-term  
**[0:07:05-0:07:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:05):**  duration.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:06):**  And if this char material is lasting in the soil for a longer term, we really need to  
**[0:07:12-0:07:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:12):**  understand the mechanisms in order to forecast what is the true impact of this addition in  
**[0:07:18-0:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:18):**  the soils.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:19):**  I know that's one of the things you were looking at was the nitrogen cycle in biochar.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  Can you talk a little bit about the research that you've done in that area?  
**[0:07:29-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  So that was one of the things that got me started in this whole biochar research area,  
**[0:07:35-0:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  was the impact that scientists started seeing on the nitrous oxide production.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:40):**  The part to me that is so fascinating still to this day about biochar is that it is, in  
**[0:07:46-0:07:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  some circumstances, a better suppressor of nitrous oxide production than some of our  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:53):**  known chemical inhibitors.  
**[0:07:55-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:55):**  Meaning that when we add biochar to soil, we get a greater decrease in production of  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  nitrous oxide than we do when we actually add chemical inhibitors for known enzymatic  
**[0:08:07-0:08:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:07):**  processes for the N2O production.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:10):**  This to me has always been the fascinating aspect of biochar.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:15):**  How could it actually be more effective than some of our chemical inhibitors that are inhibiting  
**[0:08:21-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:21):**  chemical transformation processes?  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  So that to me indicates that biochar is doing more than just one aspect of this whole puzzle.  
**[0:08:30-0:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:30):**  That there has to be multiple facets to its interaction in the soil.  
**[0:08:39-0:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  Given that promise that it's showing around nitrous oxide reductions, do you think you  
**[0:08:46-0:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:46):**  could see it becoming a part of a chemical fertilization program where NRCS, somebody  
**[0:08:56-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:56):**  is encouraging the use of biochar to mitigate some of those emissions?  
**[0:09:03-0:09:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  Potentially.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:06):**  That's outside of my realm a little bit in terms of the policy and setting regulatory  
**[0:09:11-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:11):**  directions.  
**[0:09:12-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  In terms of the science, we need to understand that predictably so then that information  
**[0:09:20-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  gets fed into the policymakers.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  And right now that's the piece of the puzzle that's a little bit convoluted.  
**[0:09:27-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:27):**  We don't exactly know precisely what the char that we are needing to create that suppression.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  And then we don't know how long that suppression is going to last long term.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  So still a lot of unknowns.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  And let's step back, zoom out a little bit.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  One of the things that I know you've looked at from going through some of the research  
**[0:09:50-0:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:50):**  you've did is different forms of biochar.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:54):**  So all biochar is not created equal.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:56):**  You could use different feed materials, you can create them at different temperatures.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  Can you talk about the variability of biochar and how all biochar is an equal?  
**[0:10:08-0:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:08):**  And if you say biochar, it's kind of like saying food when food is meat, it's dairy,  
**[0:10:15-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  and it's fruit.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  So the best analogy that I use when I'm talking to people about biochar is it's very similar  
**[0:10:23-0:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:23):**  to receiving a recipe and an ingredients for baking a cake.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:28):**  Everyone would have the exact same ingredients.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:30):**  They're following the directions exactly of the mixing time, the time it takes to bake  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:35):**  at a certain temperature.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  But everyone's cake wouldn't taste the same.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  There's just little nuances involved in the cooking process that results and magnifies  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  itself in different tastes and different textures of the final cooked or baked product.  
**[0:10:52-0:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  This is very similar and analogous to biochar.  
**[0:10:56-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:56):**  Even though we have biochars that are created under the exact same conditions, there are  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  other factors that go into the final product, just like in the baking analogy.  
**[0:11:07-0:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:07):**  So even though you might have a laboratory creating a biochar at 500 degrees Celsius,  
**[0:11:13-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:13):**  if we take that exact same apparatus now out of the lab into a field setting, it's still  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  set to create the char at 500 degrees.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  But we've seen different chemical sorption capacities, different nutrient availabilities  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  in those chars as a function of the different environments that those chars were created  
**[0:11:33-0:11:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:33):**  in.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:34):**  You know, the difference is enough to make it hard to really interpret results.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:41):**  So it's one thing to say, well, it's slightly more absorptive or it has a slightly higher  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:45):**  cation exchange capacity.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:47):**  Or is there a big difference between some of these?  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  Some of them, it's so variable that there's no universal guidance.  
**[0:11:56-0:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:56):**  There are some that are very small, non-significant differences.  
**[0:12:01-0:12:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:01):**  There are some that are statistically significant, but they have very low true value difference.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:07):**  By that, I mean if they're within the same order of magnitude, it's really not going  
**[0:12:12-0:12:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  to have a different response in the soil.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:15):**  But there are those examples out there.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:17):**  Again, it's not the vast majority.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  It's the small portion of chars that do act very strangely, even though that they were  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  created under the conditions of chars that we understood their behavior or we thought  
**[0:12:31-0:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:31):**  we could predict their behavior.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:34):**  Is this one of the reasons why it's really hard to get a handle on the efficacy of biochar?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  Is it because you do have all these different types of char functioning somewhat differently?  
**[0:12:48-0:12:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:48):**  So you try and have somebody replicate a study, but if their definition of the biochar they're  
**[0:12:55-0:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:55):**  using is different than what the original study used, they may see these different results.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:00):**  So you end up with non-correlating studies.  
**[0:13:04-0:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:04):**  That's what confounds science is the irreproducibility of this.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:11):**  The fact that I can conduct a...  
**[0:13:14-0:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:14):**  What I do a lot with the biochars, put them in soil incubations and look at the alteration  
**[0:13:19-0:13:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:19):**  in greenhouse gas production potentials.  
**[0:13:22-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:22):**  And it basically is mixing a little bit of biochar with soil, sealing them in a serum  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:27):**  vial and looking at the gas production with time.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:31):**  The fact that that simple laboratory study depends on if I started them in the winter  
**[0:13:37-0:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:37):**  or the summer here in Minnesota, that has a corresponding effect on the gas production  
**[0:13:43-0:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  potentials I measure.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:45):**  I don't fully understand what's causing those differences.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:48):**  If it's just relative humidity, whether it's the age of the char from the time it was produced,  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  the time the study was run, those are all the missing bits we're still lacking in this.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:03):**  One thing I've heard some people talk about around biochar is it can age over time and  
**[0:14:09-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  oxidize.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  Do you see that?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  You have biochar you just produced and then that sits on a shelf for 12 months or longer.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:18):**  You use it in the same study and you see potentially different results?  
**[0:14:21-0:14:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:21):**  Yes.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:22):**  And that's been one of the most frustrating parts of this is that the char itself oxidizes,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:31):**  whether we have it in soil or if it's sitting up on a shelf in a sealed container, if that  
**[0:14:36-0:14:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:36):**  container has oxygen present, these reactions do occur at different rates, depending on  
**[0:14:43-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:43):**  the temperature, depending on the storage conditions of that char.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  We still are lacking whether, how do we keep a char for three months or for a year to be  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:55):**  the exact same material that we had on day zero.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  These are all factors that are confounding the scientific part of it.  
**[0:15:04-0:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  Granted, some of these differences are non-significant, but we've known through time some of the initial  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:11):**  studies on carbon sorption showed four or five orders of magnitude change in the sorption  
**[0:15:18-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:18):**  capability of the material just to nitrogen over a period of one year.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:24):**  So these are all facets that we don't understand yet how to subdivide or segregate the important  
**[0:15:33-0:15:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:33):**  shape to the state.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:35):**  I have a piece of biochar right here, and it's sitting on a shelf and time goes by.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  I think I'd look at it and say, hey, that's just a piece of carbon with some other materials  
**[0:15:49-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:49):**  in it.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  How is it changing?  
**[0:15:51-0:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:51):**  Like what's changing on it just sitting there when it's oxidizing or other things are happening  
**[0:15:56-0:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:56):**  to it, just being exposed to the air chemically, physically, what's the difference?  
**[0:16:04-0:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:04):**  So these things are happening on the microscopic scale where appearance wise, it's going to  
**[0:16:10-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:10):**  look fairly identical over a period of the year.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:14):**  There are certain chars that if they are produced at around 550 to 600 degrees C, and if you  
**[0:16:22-0:16:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:22):**  keep them in a humid environment, they will break down physically just due to the interaction  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:27):**  with water vapor as well.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:30):**  So this goes back to some of the old charcoal studies where you saw char that turns into

**[0:16:39-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:39):**  And these are all physical changes.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  The chemical changes are more difficult to quantify because our eyes don't pick up on  
**[0:16:49-0:16:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:49):**  a lot of them.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:51):**  And some of them are just structural opening and closing of pores that lead to different

**[0:17:01-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:01):**  So it's one of the facets, I still don't have a table that I can say this percentage is  
**[0:17:07-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:07):**  due to oxygen, this percentage is due to relative humidity, this percentage is just due to time  
**[0:17:12-0:17:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  and chemical evaporation.  
**[0:17:15-0:17:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:15):**  Those are things that are still lacking in terms of overall guidance.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  Do you think maybe science has got a little cart before the horse here where we're trying  
**[0:17:27-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:27):**  to use it in agricultural plant-based studies to see what it does when it affects plant  
**[0:17:34-0:17:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  growth is looking a little past what we know since you can't quantify how it ages, you  
**[0:17:40-0:17:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:40):**  can't really determine what the best material is at the best time of year until those are  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:46):**  more knowns?  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:48):**  Seems to me like why even research it's interactions with plant growth until you know more about  
**[0:17:55-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  what the input itself is and how it behaves?  
**[0:18:01-0:18:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:01):**  Things we hope to advance with science is through multiple studies we begin to come  
**[0:18:08-0:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:08):**  to that unified idea like you're saying before, are these factors truly driving factors or  
**[0:18:14-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:14):**  not?  
**[0:18:15-0:18:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  Are they more cosmetic and just of scientific importance but the practical importance would  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:21):**  be lower?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  Those are the fundamental questions that we're still trying to search for.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:29):**  The complication is when we compile data we have different types of chars produced, different  
**[0:18:37-0:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  parolicizers, different laboratories and without having the fundamental estimates of their  
**[0:18:47-0:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:47):**  differences it's hard to then take that and assemble and say well here is a mechanism  
**[0:18:52-0:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  that's occurring on char A compared to char B. So it's one of the biggest hurdles yet  
**[0:19:00-0:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  is understanding this reproducible and predictability of the biochar response.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:08):**  Which is probably even tough in and of itself over time because if you're making biochar  
**[0:19:15-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:15):**  ideally locally, if you're making it in Minnesota, I'm making it in San Diego, somebody else  
**[0:19:21-0:19:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  is making it in Florida, you probably have all different available waste feedstock to  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:28):**  use, we're all going to end up with something different even if we use the same equipment  
**[0:19:32-0:19:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:32):**  to make it and we're all in different climates so now you have kind of this study where nothing's  
**[0:19:40-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:40):**  the same even though it all set out to be the same.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:44):**  Correct and even if we look at a species of wood, if we say well everyone use maple or  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  oak at their particular location because those trees were grown in different soils under  
**[0:19:56-0:20:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  different climates their mineral content is different and whether or not that is a fundamental  
**[0:20:03-0:20:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:03):**  factor in all this is still open for debate.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:09):**  What about this, if we look at the litany of materials out there we could make this  
**[0:20:12-0:20:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  from manure to macadamia nut hulls to sawdust up through lumber, can you go out on a limb  
**[0:20:24-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:24):**  and say if we're looking at this for agricultural purposes is there a sweet spot of materials  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  where we don't know for sure what's probably going to make the best biochar agriculturally  
**[0:20:35-0:20:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:35):**  but it's going to be more this over this?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:45):**  The only problem with that is it depends on what the soil is deficient in.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  If we're looking at a soil that's deficient in nutrients then the manure based biochars  
**[0:20:57-0:20:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:57):**  are going to be better.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:58):**  If we're looking for a char that is extraordinarily strong that we're trying to change the soil  
**[0:21:05-0:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:05):**  physical properties for water holding or for tillage and non-compacting then some of the  
**[0:21:12-0:21:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:12):**  feedstocks that have more rigid lignin, the hardwood or even some of the swine manure  
**[0:21:19-0:21:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:19):**  based biochars have been shown to be higher physical properties than those that are created  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:25):**  from straight biomass sources.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:28):**  And then if we're looking at increasing silica content in a soil then it would be a grass  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:34):**  based biochar.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  So that's one of the biggest difficulties in this arena is there isn't going to be a  
**[0:21:43-0:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:43):**  single type that's going to be universal across all soils.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:49):**  It's going to be dependent on the soil deficiencies in that area and if we can target or design  
**[0:21:57-0:22:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  a biochar to relieve those deficiencies that's the ones they see having the biggest positive  
**[0:22:04-0:22:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:04):**  economic impact.  
**[0:22:07-0:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:07):**  Just side stepping a little bit, silica deficient soils making biochar out of grass, where would  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:15):**  you see soils like that and why would you need to up the silica content?  
**[0:22:21-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:21):**  Well silica is one of the good natural absorbers of soil moisture and so then that would be  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  the corresponding formula for those soils.  
**[0:22:33-0:22:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:33):**  That would increase the silica content, would also increase the water holding capacity on  
**[0:22:38-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  a chemical surface effect.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:41):**  So that's the reason why those would be targeted.  
**[0:22:45-0:22:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:45):**  SEG grew grass and I was going to harvest that and make biochar to dry it out, make  
**[0:22:51-0:22:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:51):**  the biochar and I did that and I applied that to the soil and then I did alternative B which  
**[0:22:58-0:23:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:58):**  is I grew that grass and I just tilled that grass in, would that same silica be entering  
**[0:23:04-0:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:04):**  the soil the same way or would you see a difference?  
**[0:23:07-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:07):**  It would be the same, there would be slight total content differences because you might  
**[0:23:12-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  lose a little bit with pyrolysis on a per mass basis but overall it'd still be the silicon  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  oxide that you're adding.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  If you look at all these different materials out there and really what we know about biochar,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:30):**  if I had a bucket of knowns, are there knowns agriculturally that we can say okay we can  
**[0:23:39-0:23:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:39):**  generally say these are in the known bucket, like it'll help increase moisture holding  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:44):**  capacity in the soil, it'll help aerate soils and it's going to sequester carbon even though  
**[0:23:51-0:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:51):**  we don't understand everything and there is all this variability and it can change, would  
**[0:23:55-0:24:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:55):**  you say all three of those are knowns, it's just the specificity of those knowns might  
**[0:24:00-0:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:00):**  vary?  
**[0:24:01-0:24:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:01):**  I'd probably say the degree to which we're absolutely certain in them vary.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:08):**  The fact that it sequesters carbon is almost undisputed.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  We do create a more stabilized carbon form that is positive for sequestering carbon.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:19):**  The more of the arguments on that topic is whether or not that carbon behaves like soil  
**[0:24:28-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  organic carbon which is typically viewed as available to microbes to undergo transformation.  
**[0:24:35-0:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:35):**  The data so far indicates that no it's more structural carbon where that carbon really  
**[0:24:42-0:24:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:42):**  doesn't participate in the biogeochemical cycle which is the primary motive for sequestering  
**[0:24:49-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:49):**  carbon by that mechanism to chemically alter it so that it's not available to microbes.  
**[0:24:56-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  So that side of it is pretty much undisputed that we do create more stabilized carbon.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  The alteration in water holding, we see that I would say maybe 75 to 80 percent of the  
**[0:25:10-0:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:10):**  time of the studies.  
**[0:25:12-0:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:12):**  There are the few that when it's added there is no or a negative impact and that's really  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  what I've been kind of focused on trying to figure out well why do we see that negative  
**[0:25:22-0:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  impact with those charts.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  So it actually makes like a hydrophobic effect in the soil?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:31):**  Not necessarily hydrophobic it's just that it reduces the water availability even though  
**[0:25:36-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:36):**  the water is still there it's just not as available to plants as we think it should  
**[0:25:42-0:25:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  be based on that soil texture.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:46):**  So thinking of those three knowns that have that different degree is there anything else  
**[0:25:51-0:25:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  you'd put in the known bucket of biochar has a degree of known around this that's above

**[0:28:19-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:19):**  Based on our knowledge right now is it appears like all the studies have been targeting between  
**[0:28:28-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  0.5 and 1.5 percent by volume biochar additions that's still a fairly substantial addition  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  but in order for the studies to see significant effects that has been the application rate  
**[0:28:46-0:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  that most people have been targeting.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:49):**  Once we understand the mechanism of action we'll be able to optimize the production and  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  that's when we'll be able to bring down the application rates.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:01):**  So people often say well why do you worry about a mechanism for biochar why don't we  
**[0:29:06-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:06):**  just apply it and off we go with sequestering carbon.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  It comes down to that very issue whereas if we don't understand how it's working there's  
**[0:29:16-0:29:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  no way to fundamentally optimize it and we get it down to the absolute minimum amendment  
**[0:29:23-0:29:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:23):**  size so we can make it profitable and economical for application.  
**[0:29:30-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:30):**  Does it fall into the category of more might be better more pizza is better than less pizza  
**[0:29:37-0:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  more compost is better than less compost more biochar is better than less biochar?  
**[0:29:45-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:45):**  Not always a lot of times the response decreases with application rate and again we don't fully  
**[0:29:52-0:29:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:52):**  understand the mechanisms behind that and for each char the optimal amendment rate appears  
**[0:29:59-0:30:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:59):**  to be different so those are still I'd say outstanding scientific questions.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:08):**  One of the things I hear people often say is when you first make it after pyrolysis  
**[0:30:14-0:30:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:14):**  it's just char and you need to add the bio to it so it needs to be have biology introduced  
**[0:30:21-0:30:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:21):**  to it in some way.  
**[0:30:24-0:30:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:24):**  What have been your impressions that you've seen in studies of I take char straight out  
**[0:30:31-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:31):**  of a pyrolysis kiln and I apply it to the soil versus I do something to that I soak  
**[0:30:36-0:30:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:36):**  it in a manure tea I run into compost pile I inoculate it with biology is that something  
**[0:30:46-0:30:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:46):**  you view as that's an important step and there is a difference between an activated or living  
**[0:30:53-0:30:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:53):**  biochar versus one straight out of the kiln?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  If we're just talking about taking a char and adding it to soil for plant effects then  
**[0:31:04-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:04):**  I would definitely say the preconditioning whether it be in the compost tea the nutrient  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  solutions those studies have led to more positive effects than the studies that just take the  
**[0:31:17-0:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:17):**  straight char and apply it to soil without the preconditioning or preloading effect.  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:24):**  The downside is we fundamentally don't understand the mechanisms yet by which that enrichment  
**[0:31:32-0:31:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  occurs we can't say that while it's making nitrogen twice as available or it's going  
**[0:31:39-0:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:39):**  to last for 10 years at that increased availability load those are still the questions that we're  
**[0:31:47-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:47):**  trying to answer as to what's occurring during these preconditioning phases.  
**[0:31:53-0:32:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:53):**  If you have a piece of biochar here sitting here and I do say introduce it to a nutrient  
**[0:32:01-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:01):**  solution what are the properties unique to the char that make nutrients want to attach  
**[0:32:08-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:08):**  to it how can it actually absorb the nutrients and this kind of lends into why we may want  
**[0:32:14-0:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  to use it in agricultural soils?  
**[0:32:18-0:32:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:18):**  The mechanisms are primarily due to surface chemical absorption due to anion exchange  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:25):**  where you have the nitrate nitrite be attracted to the negative side of the positive side  
**[0:32:32-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:32):**  of the char being attracted to the negative species.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  For ammonia it's the cation exchange capacity would control the sorption capacity.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:41):**  For phosphorus it appears from the literature to date to correlate with the calcium content  
**[0:32:49-0:32:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:49):**  present in the char relates to how much phosphorus that char can absorb so it really boils down  
**[0:32:57-0:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  to the surface chemistry of the char that controls the amount of nutrients absorption.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:05):**  There's some out there that feel that the char absorbs pore water so like if you put  
**[0:33:11-0:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:11):**  it in an enriched nitrogen solution that water permeates into the char then that nitrate  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:17):**  that's uncaptured with that water is then available.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:21):**  All of these mechanisms are at play we still don't have the flow chart to divide up saying  
**[0:33:27-0:33:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  well this one is 10% capture 20% surface chemistry 80% precipitation or whatever it turns out  
**[0:33:35-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  to be.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  One of the common thoughts around that line is biochar it absorbs the stuff it has a massive  
**[0:33:45-0:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  surface area but organic matter in the soil itself has a lot of surface area.  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:52):**  Do you have a sense of regular organic matter not pyrolyzed and then char of is there a  
**[0:34:00-0:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:00):**  significant surface area difference between the two and is there a different anion cation  
**[0:34:06-0:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:06):**  exchange capacity between the two?  
**[0:34:08-0:34:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  Because it's a lot easier to add organic matter to the soil if we can get the same pore space  
**[0:34:13-0:34:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:13):**  the same tilth the same water holding capacity from organic matter why go through the trouble  
**[0:34:18-0:34:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:18):**  of making biochar if we put aside well this carbon is more recalcitrant it's going to  
**[0:34:24-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:24):**  sit there longer so if we just throw that argument out if we just look at it from water  
**[0:34:29-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  holding capacity pore space nutrient holding capacity biochar versus organic matter is  
**[0:34:35-0:34:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  there a difference?  
**[0:34:38-0:34:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:38):**  The fundamental difference in that comparison would boil down to the longevity of how long  
**[0:34:43-0:34:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:43):**  that material would survive in the soil.  
**[0:34:46-0:34:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:46):**  By adding just straight organic matter we'd be looking at zero to maybe five six years  
**[0:34:53-0:35:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  with biochar we're hoping to extend those effects for decades to centuries to millennia.  
**[0:35:01-0:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  And that's one thing I didn't realize until I started looking at some of your presentations  
**[0:35:06-0:35:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  is there's actually a wide band of how long people think this biochar can be available  
**[0:35:13-0:35:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:13):**  in the soil.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:14):**  I think there's one slide you had that showed a lot of studies of a hundred years up through  
**[0:35:19-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:19):**  ten thousand years.  
**[0:35:22-0:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:22):**  What's your current opinion in terms of where it is and what affects how long that carbon  
**[0:35:27-0:35:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:27):**  could sit in the soil?  
**[0:35:30-0:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:30):**  From the research to date it definitely has a residency time that exceeds ten to fifty  
**[0:35:38-0:35:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  years after that it gets into more of a modeling predictability and how well do we feel that  
**[0:35:46-0:35:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:46):**  we've captured the degradable portion of that char has it fully degraded everything that

**[0:35:55-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:55):**  Those are where we're left with these arguments over if it's been a hundred years or if it's  
**[0:36:00-0:36:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  a thousand or millennia.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:03):**  It's really a difficult question to answer because we don't have the data set that we'd

**[0:36:16-0:36:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:16):**  carbon cycling and modeling in the soil system we have a fairly confident interval that we  
**[0:36:24-0:36:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:24):**  know that's lasting hundreds of years at the minimum.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  Just as part of the carbon cycle what is it about the carbon and biochar that makes it  
**[0:36:33-0:36:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  unique so you have you have fungi decomposer fungi that go in and they'll break down cellulose  
**[0:36:38-0:36:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:38):**  they'll break down lignans with enzymes that they secrete and then you get lower order  
**[0:36:43-0:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:43):**  fungi that'll come through and then maybe the lower order sugars that those fungi have

**[0:36:50-0:36:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:50):**  Why can they not go at char and break that down?  
**[0:36:55-0:37:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:55):**  What don't they like about that or what makes that carbon difficult compared to un-pyrrolyzed  
**[0:37:00-0:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:00):**  piece of wood?  
**[0:37:02-0:37:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:02):**  So the primary difference is the chemical makeup.  
**[0:37:06-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:06):**  So in sugars, carbohydrates, hemicellulose, lignan you have carbon that is partially aromatized  
**[0:37:14-0:37:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  meaning that it's the double bonds are almost fully conjugated but they're not completely  
**[0:37:20-0:37:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:20):**  conjugated systems.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:23):**  When you pyrolyze those organic starting materials through the process of pyrolysis due to the  
**[0:37:30-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:30):**  fact that you're adding energy you end up creating a more stabilized carbon structure  
**[0:37:36-0:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:36):**  which is a conjugated aromatic carbon backbone where it's almost just pure carbon.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  There's not any substituted groups on the benzene rings.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:50):**  They all end up getting condensed down to just the carbon graphitic hexagonal structure.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  That then leads to the higher energy requirement for the enzymes to break down or to destroy  
**[0:38:06-0:38:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  those carbon bonds require a higher energy input from the enzyme and as long as there's  
**[0:38:12-0:38:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:12):**  another carbon source available there would be no reason why the enzyme would go after  
**[0:38:18-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:18):**  that higher energy output than it would need to get the same carbon that it gets from the  
**[0:38:25-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  less aromatic materials.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  I don't know if you know the answer to this but if that sits in the soil for a very very  
**[0:38:34-0:38:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:34):**  long time hundreds thousands of years based on the modeling is it like a stone on a beach  
**[0:38:41-0:38:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:41):**  shore the waves just batter it over time and eventually all that battering slowly breaks  
**[0:38:49-0:38:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:49):**  down that rock is that's what's happening to that char like in a moment of time the  
**[0:38:55-0:39:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:55):**  enzymes from the fungi are going to say there's easier sources I'm not going to go for this  
**[0:39:00-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:00):**  but that charge is going to come in contact with some enzymes they phase it you know a  
**[0:39:04-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  tiny bit and then the next one phases a little bit more and then you add up all those little  
**[0:39:08-0:39:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  phases over a very very long period of time and eventually it is now broken down.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:14):**  Correct but the rate of that degradation is so long that that's why we consider it sequestered  
**[0:39:21-0:39:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:21):**  carbon because the carbon is removed from the biogeochemical cycle that occurs under  
**[0:39:28-0:39:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  very fast time periods to this longer time period where it's just a very slow transition  
**[0:39:36-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:36):**  there's no material that is resistance to break down and degradation in the environment  
**[0:39:44-0:39:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  everything breaks down with time it's just the rate at which it's breaking down for bio  
**[0:39:50-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:50):**  char is significantly slower than it is for any other organic material.  
**[0:39:57-0:40:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:57):**  So in a perfect agricultural world you're adding this and fresh organic material to  
**[0:40:05-0:40:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:05):**  a soil to keep those soils productive so it's kind of like I'm saying I'm paying some now  
**[0:40:11-0:40:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:11):**  I'm paying some down the line I keep long-term carbon in the soil for generations ahead but  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:18):**  I'm also feeding myself today.  
**[0:40:22-0:40:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:22):**  Correct and that trade-off is really the balance of how much carbon we want to sequester in  
**[0:40:30-0:40:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:30):**  the soil in the system over just adding organic materials we'd have to keep adding more and  
**[0:40:37-0:40:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37):**  more organic materials to keep ahead of that degradation but it's kind of a self-perpetuating  
**[0:40:43-0:40:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:43):**  cycle the more material we add the higher the microbial population becomes the faster  
**[0:40:49-0:40:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:49):**  the rate of degradation with char we hope to intersect that feedback loop where we could  
**[0:40:57-0:41:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:57):**  add more stabilized carbon but the rate of mineralization of that carbon will still remain  
**[0:41:03-0:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  very low.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:06):**  We know that if we add organic material to the soil like you just said that that will  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:11):**  stimulate microbial growth are there any studies out there that you're aware of that show a

**[0:41:33-0:41:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:33):**  There I mean there's been studies that have shown differences in select groups of micro  
**[0:41:39-0:41:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:39):**  but that's not a universal of predictability yet or we can say that the pseudomonas bacteria  
**[0:41:47-0:41:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:47):**  is increased by biochar there are select groups that are more adept at degrading aromatic

**[0:42:03-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:03):**  the increase depends on the remainder of the population or what the original soil's activity  
**[0:42:10-0:42:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:10):**  was before we added the char.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:12):**  One of the things that drew me and likely a lot of people into biochar are articles

**[0:42:54-0:43:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:54):**  something really significant there from biochar and did those people know something about

**[0:43:08-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:08):**  So it's a lot of the interpretation of the scientific evidence right now the Amazon forest

**[0:47:01-0:47:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:01):**  because we found that there are co-located on these sites but we just don't really know

**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:14):**  that oh there was a natural clearing event then the amazonians settled in that area and  
**[0:47:19-0:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  they used that land which was then found to be productive so we don't know what they did  
**[0:47:26-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:26):**  then but we can look at that now from our own lens do you know if people gone and looked  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:34):**  at that soil and said okay well here's all this char in the soil we don't know how it

**[0:47:56-0:48:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:56):**  can we look at it today and say that char regardless of how it got there makes that  
**[0:48:02-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:02):**  soil better from an agricultural standpoint.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  But we do know that that soil is more productive from an agricultural standpoint today.  
**[0:48:14-0:48:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:14):**  The disadvantages soil formation is a process that involves multiple variables from not

**[0:48:36-0:48:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  of the soil formation process.  
**[0:48:41-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:41):**  The char addition causes multiple changes it's not just solely adding char alone it  
**[0:48:50-0:48:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  is fundamentally altering those other pathways and how those pathways interact and end up  
**[0:48:57-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:57):**  forming the terra preta soil that we see today is something that is missing in terms of the  
**[0:49:04-0:49:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  actual procedural mechanistic understanding of it.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:11):**  Can we look at that soil and say hmm like there's something unique about this because  
**[0:49:16-0:49:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:16):**  given that char has been there for so long it's one thing we can do today when we look  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:22):**  at it and just say like something normally this wouldn't be right if this char wasn't  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:27):**  here like we're seeing higher levels of this that we could isolate down due to the char  
**[0:49:32-0:49:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:32):**  being present or again is that just hard because you have all these other variables acting  
**[0:49:36-0:49:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:36):**  on the soil.  
**[0:49:39-0:49:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:39):**  I haven't had the opportunity to investigate a lot of the different terra preta soils I've  
**[0:49:44-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:44):**  only had the opportunity to look at about five different terra preta soils in my laboratory.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  The part that's to me was fascinating about them is that they have higher total microbial  
**[0:49:57-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:57):**  populations but the overall rate of carbon turnover is lower in the soil so they have  
**[0:50:05-0:50:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  more microbes but they turn the carbon over to a slower rate than what you would anticipate  
**[0:50:13-0:50:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:13):**  for that population.  
**[0:50:17-0:50:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:17):**  Fundamentally I don't have an answer as to why this is occurring but that's one of the  
**[0:50:21-0:50:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:21):**  other mysteries of these terra preta soils is that they have higher microbial populations  
**[0:50:30-0:50:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:30):**  but their carbon turnover is lower.  
**[0:50:33-0:50:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:33):**  Now if that's due to the char we don't fully understand exactly the mechanisms of how that's  
**[0:50:40-0:50:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:40):**  interacting with the soil microbial populations.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:46):**  So if we just take that fact there more carbon or higher microbial population but slower  
**[0:50:53-0:50:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:53):**  turnover of that carbon in the soil like in theory that sounds great like we're getting  
**[0:50:58-0:51:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:58):**  all this micro activity we're retaining all this carbon perfect but if you think about  
**[0:51:02-0:51:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:02):**  that in an agricultural sense how does that relate to plant growth?  
**[0:51:07-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:07):**  Higher microbes but less carbon being turned over I'm thinking ultimately carbons there  
**[0:51:16-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  is a food source for microbes so if you can get more microbes and keep that carbon there  
**[0:51:21-0:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  it's the microbes that are helping the plants not the carbon so in that situation that's  
**[0:51:28-0:51:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  a positive for ag?  
**[0:51:31-0:51:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:31):**  It could be.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:32):**  It could be a positive for certain periods and then due to the fact that it would be  
**[0:51:38-0:51:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:38):**  a slower rate of turnover there could be a period of time when the plant wouldn't have  
**[0:51:43-0:51:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  the needed nutrients in that situation so it all boils down to the rates of what that  
**[0:51:52-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:52):**  the cycle that we need to keep the nutrient availability for plant growth to be going  
**[0:51:57-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  in the soil to know whether or not the slowdown if it is truly a slowdown in the activity  
**[0:52:05-0:52:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  or the functionality that's still an open area of understanding how and why that's occurring.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:13):**  Do you know what segment of microbes are showing a higher population is it everything is it  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:19):**  bacteria fungi molds geese everything in the soil is higher or is there one section out  
**[0:52:25-0:52:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:25):**  of that that is really high?  
**[0:52:29-0:52:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:29):**  That's a little bit outside my area so I really don't have the true knowledge to comment on  
**[0:52:34-0:52:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:34):**  that it looked from the historical perspective it looks like the char addition helps fungi  
**[0:52:42-0:52:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:42):**  populations.  
**[0:52:45-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:45):**  But it's difficult because once you bring the soil back to the laboratory the fungi  
**[0:52:49-0:52:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  are the most affected by that sampling process so there is a lot of loose ends to that whole  
**[0:52:57-0:52:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:57):**  picture yet.  
**[0:52:58-0:53:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:58):**  So if we start to put all this together let's say I had a thousand acres in the Midwest  
**[0:53:05-0:53:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:05):**  and I had an unlimited budget and I was going to go out and apply that one one and a half  
**[0:53:13-0:53:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:13):**  by volume biochar to the soils and I came up and said Kurt you know I want to do this  
**[0:53:21-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:21):**  would you be like yeah go for it or would there be some hesitancy to say you might it  
**[0:53:28-0:53:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:28):**  sounds good but but I'd be wary of these might be the negative effects of doing this.  
**[0:53:35-0:53:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:35):**  The biggest complication I face is that I don't have enough scientific basis to say  
**[0:53:42-0:53:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:42):**  it's going to be positive or negative so it's I'm in a very difficult position when people  
**[0:53:50-0:53:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:50):**  ask well how much biochar should I add to my soils and they want to add the char because  
**[0:53:56-0:54:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:56):**  they've seen all the positive things on the web the fact that it does increase all productivity  
**[0:54:01-0:54:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:01):**  so in their mind they've already convinced that yep it is a positive thing to add.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:07):**  We just don't have the true science to base a prediction for all the soils and the soil  
**[0:54:15-0:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  types.  
**[0:54:18-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  Is there any big downside to doing that like like we don't know if that really if it's  
**[0:54:23-0:54:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:23):**  positive but can you see like a it's one thing to say okay we have some yield loss and maybe  
**[0:54:29-0:54:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:29):**  that's 10% and I know margins are thin in corn and soy that could make a huge difference  
**[0:54:33-0:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:33):**  or it could be a catastrophic yield loss you know it goes from 300 bushels per acre now  
**[0:54:41-0:54:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  you're down to 100.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:45):**  There really isn't evidence in the literature of catastrophic events like that it's primarily  
**[0:54:53-0:55:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:53):**  10 15 20% type reductions but the cautionary statement I have on it is since we don't understand  
**[0:55:03-0:55:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:03):**  the full interactions and the mechanisms we really can't say with confidence what it's  
**[0:55:10-0:55:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:10):**  going to do in five years or 10 years or 15 years.  
**[0:55:16-0:55:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:16):**  Granted it does look like from if you look at this entire assembly of all the literature  
**[0:55:21-0:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:21):**  out there we have over a 50% chance of having a positive impact.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:27):**  That would be great except with there are those individual isolated cases of having  
**[0:55:34-0:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:34):**  a lot of volatiles on the chart of having a poor paralysis process that we do know create  
**[0:55:40-0:55:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:40):**  the negatives but there's other negative aspects created that we don't fully understand their  
**[0:55:46-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:46):**  mechanisms.  
**[0:55:49-0:55:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  Is there if we could go into the knowledge ether and we could pull out one key piece  
**[0:55:56-0:56:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:56):**  of known when it relates to biochar is there something you if like if you knew this one  
**[0:56:03-0:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  thing it would make these types of recommendations much more definitive and quantifiable.  
**[0:56:17-0:56:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  So from my standpoint in my research it would primarily be the reproducibility of the char.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:27):**  Once we would fully be able to understand all of the factors going into creating a char  
**[0:56:35-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:35):**  as long as every time that we would then use that process to create it we would get the  
**[0:56:41-0:56:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  same char would be a tremendous step forward in the scientific understanding.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:48):**  There are some companies and industry partners that I've dealt with that are very close to  
**[0:56:55-0:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:55):**  that but there's still those one in ten one in twenty chars that are different and understanding  
**[0:57:06-0:57:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:06):**  what those properties are would be key.  
**[0:57:12-0:57:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:12):**  For if we look at industrial use for people using activated carbon for things like water  
**[0:57:17-0:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:17):**  filtration do they know that like can they produce the same carbon product each and every  
**[0:57:24-0:57:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:24):**  time?  
**[0:57:27-0:57:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:27):**  They have so a lot of the large activated carbon industry know the recipe and their  
**[0:57:35-0:57:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:35):**  activation agents a lot of that is protected under patents it is not in the open literature.  
**[0:57:43-0:57:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:43):**  They understand to get a highly producible product sector but it does cost a considerable  
**[0:57:54-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:54):**  amount of money to achieve that uniform product.  
**[0:57:59-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  Do they potentially have a key to this problem like if they all open their books and suddenly  
**[0:58:06-0:58:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  like hey here's how we're doing this do you end up with okay well we could do it but now  
**[0:58:11-0:58:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  it's just an expensive process with sophisticated equipment?  
**[0:58:20-0:58:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:20):**  I don't think they would have the full answers yet for all of the agriculture questions.  
**[0:58:29-0:58:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:29):**  For individual chemicals option yes by all means Calgon, Midwest, Faco they are the next  
**[0:58:35-0:58:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:35):**  area.  
**[0:58:37-0:58:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:37):**  Actually take a step back and look then as what we are trying to do with the char it's  
**[0:58:48-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:48):**  not really that the emphasis is not on creating an absolute pure product yet so that's where  
**[0:58:57-0:59:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:57):**  it's been this kind of battle between having a product that is inexpensive simple to produce  
**[0:59:05-0:59:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:05):**  or do we have a is extraordinarily old everything is within very tight margins to end up with  
**[0:59:14-0:59:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:14):**  the predictable product.  
**[0:59:16-0:59:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  That's where I'm still at a quandary over what is going to be the pathway for biochar.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:23):**  Is it going to be more of the homemade type systems cost or is it going to be the high  
**[0:59:29-0:59:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:29):**  end control?  
**[0:59:34-0:59:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:34):**  So where do agriculture and science and the citizen scientists go from here?  
**[0:59:41-0:59:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:41):**  It sounds like there's just there's a lot of unknowns at a scientific level it's very  
**[0:59:46-0:59:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:46):**  complex to try and figure out some of these knowns and you have farmers who you said they've  
**[0:59:52-0:59:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:52):**  already decided in their brain like I want to do this.  
**[0:59:55-1:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:55):**  Do you just keep making it how you can try and use it and then make your own assessment  
**[1:00:03-1:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:03):**  based upon what you see in the fields whether it's working or not working and is that a  
**[1:00:09-1:00:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:09):**  way to push it forward because if you just pause and wait for science to figure out we  
**[1:00:14-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:14):**  might be a long ways out so how do you how do we make progress and use this tool if you  
**[1:00:21-1:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  like the general concept of it and still advance this?  
**[1:00:28-1:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:28):**  So what I've been going to accomplish in my research is to utilize the citizen science  
**[1:00:35-1:00:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:35):**  component to this since the book is so aided about biochar I've been willing to participate  
**[1:00:43-1:00:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:43):**  in some of the research programs I've come up with.  
**[1:00:47-1:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:47):**  The one I completed was sending chars out to volunteers that they could bury in their  
**[1:00:54-1:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:54):**  soil and then they're back to me after three and six months so that I could gain an entire  
**[1:01:00-1:01:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:00):**  library of different soil different climate using the same char kind of again to unlock  
**[1:01:08-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:08):**  this mystery of the char aging.  
**[1:01:12-1:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  That research I've gotten the char samples back and I'm still waiting to the laboratory  
**[1:01:17-1:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:17):**  full time to get all those analysis.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:22):**  For people that do want to produce it at home there's a lot of simple ways to do it through  
**[1:01:27-1:01:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:27):**  things like cone kilns and other simple metal kilns.  
**[1:01:33-1:01:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:33):**  Having investigated a lot of chars with different materials is there kind of a sweet spot you'd  
**[1:01:37-1:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:37):**  say I'd look here and again given that this is a home user let's say their soils are reasonably  
**[1:01:43-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:43):**  productive already because they're doing composting and things like that they just want to they're  
**[1:01:47-1:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  an biochar enthusiast they want to add more is there a feedstock material you think that  
**[1:01:52-1:01:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:52):**  they should really focus on and is there a temperature range that you should really try  
**[1:01:57-1:02:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  and shoot for when producing that char to make the best I'll call it the all around  
**[1:02:04-1:02:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:04):**  you know just general use biochar for home scale.  
**[1:02:09-1:02:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:09):**  I really wish I had that answer it's been the most difficult part of my 10 years in  
**[1:02:19-1:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:19):**  the biochar now has been the lack of those answers and it's something that I just I don't  
**[1:02:28-1:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:28):**  have a good answer for.  
**[1:02:31-1:02:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:31):**  What about just temperature so say you are there some general understandings of biochar  
**[1:02:38-1:02:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:38):**  produced at temperature x versus biochar produced at temperature greater than x that that could  
**[1:02:45-1:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:45):**  help people think about the char that they want to produce.  
**[1:02:52-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:52):**  So it kind of boils down to what you're hoping for that char the low temp they are act more  
**[1:03:02-1:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:02):**  because there's more surface chemistry on them than their temperature char for removing  
**[1:03:13-1:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:13):**  agro chemicals from the soil system.  
**[1:03:17-1:03:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:17):**  So the fun guidance goes back to what you're really trying to do for your soil you're trying  
**[1:03:26-1:03:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:26):**  to get a material that stimulate a little microbial then the lower temperatures appear  
**[1:03:33-1:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:33):**  to be the better choice for getting the option of some chemical then the temperature chars  
**[1:03:45-1:03:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:45):**  would be the better choice for that scenario.  
**[1:03:51-1:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:51):**  One concern I have heard some people voice and be curious to get your thoughts on the  
**[1:03:56-1:04:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:56):**  validity of this is trees are long lived and they're always absorbing stuff out of the  
**[1:04:04-1:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:04):**  air out of the soil is there a risk of creating biochar from woody biomass that has potentially  
**[1:04:15-1:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:15):**  sequestered heavy metals toxins into the wood itself and now you burn it it remains in the  
**[1:04:23-1:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:23):**  char now you're concentrating that in an agricultural system?  
**[1:04:32-1:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:32):**  In my opinion so far it would be very difficult to get to that level from a biomass source  
**[1:04:42-1:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:42):**  if you were utilizing a contaminated waste stream either destruction debris something  
**[1:04:51-1:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:51):**  that was treated with heavy metals that's where that would become more of a concern  
**[1:04:57-1:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:57):**  in my opinion right now a lot of it boils down to if the tree was growing it would be  
**[1:05:04-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:04):**  very difficult to accumulate enough heavy metals in that tree to cause harm further  
**[1:05:12-1:05:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  on.  
**[1:05:13-1:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:13):**  Now that's caveat there are different species that accumulate heavy metals preferentially  
**[1:05:18-1:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:18):**  than other species but in general that would be my comment on it that the fact that you're  
**[1:05:25-1:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:25):**  just paralyzing a living biomass already it would have had to have contents of heavy metals  
**[1:05:32-1:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:32):**  that were low enough to allow growth so I don't see that allowing that cycle then to  
**[1:05:39-1:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:39):**  build up if you were taking waste from a contaminated sources then yes that would be of high concern.  
**[1:05:49-1:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:49):**  What about the production of biochar itself is there this is another concern is there  
**[1:05:54-1:06:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:54):**  risk of potentially producing toxic organic compounds in the process that you're then  
**[1:06:02-1:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:02):**  introducing to the soil?  
**[1:06:06-1:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:06):**  There are some studies that have looked at this it's an area that we've relied heavily  
**[1:06:13-1:06:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  on the wood ash industry in terms of the analogy looking at the contents of all the priority  
**[1:06:20-1:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:20):**  pollutants that are present in ashes.  
**[1:06:23-1:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:23):**  There's been very few chars that are made by the slow paralysis that contain a high  
**[1:06:31-1:06:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:31):**  quantity of toxic chemicals.  
**[1:06:36-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:36):**  There are some chars that are produced in extremely fast or flash paralysis that are  
**[1:06:43-1:06:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43):**  more prone to absorption of those chemicals just because there's not enough time to fully  
**[1:06:49-1:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:49):**  convert them but again that's still a little bit of an area that needs more research.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:58):**  Most people listening to this are farmers of some scale to start closing this out what  
**[1:07:05-1:07:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:05):**  do you want farmers to take away about biochar what we know about it today and where it's  
**[1:07:12-1:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:12):**  going how should they think about it?  
**[1:07:19-1:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:19):**  So currently I would say that biochar is definitely a piece of the puzzle to our combating climate  
**[1:07:29-1:07:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:29):**  mitigation strategies for agriculture.  
**[1:07:32-1:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:32):**  The difficulty right now is we don't have full understanding over application rates  
**[1:07:41-1:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:41):**  over exactly what mechanisms this is doing in the soil.  
**[1:07:46-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:46):**  That doesn't mean that we should abandon this idea.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  Biochar has shown tremendous effects in certain circumstances to the fact that that's what  
**[1:07:58-1:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:58):**  keeps the researchers excited about this material given all of the heterogeneity all of the  
**[1:08:05-1:08:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:05):**  difficulties in the researching of it the fact that it has these mystical properties  
**[1:08:12-1:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:12):**  still warrants research and to attempt to understand what it's doing in the hope that  
**[1:08:19-1:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:19):**  we can optimize it for the agricultural sector.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:23):**  Well said and for somebody who is farming and wants to start to use it as part of their  
**[1:08:30-1:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:30):**  farming practice how do they get good advice or information on application where do they  
**[1:08:40-1:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:40):**  go for that information?  
**[1:08:41-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:41):**  I mean even asking you you're somebody who does this all the time and you've done it  
**[1:08:46-1:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:46):**  for a decade and you struggle with giving recommendations given all the unknowns and  
**[1:08:52-1:08:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:52):**  there's a lot of people who you know really they're you know I'll say they're just trying  
**[1:08:57-1:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  to sell a product at the end of the day without understanding all these little nuances so  
**[1:09:04-1:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:04):**  if you do believe in this and you want to use it how do you make an educated decision  
**[1:09:08-1:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:08):**  about actually spending a dollar doing something that's right versus just taking a flyer?  
**[1:09:20-1:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:20):**  That's it's one of the big challenges I don't have a straight answer for that.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:27):**  I wish that there's was like an entire depository that we could have for all of the existing  
**[1:09:36-1:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:36):**  biochar and studies so if someone was growing watermelons they could go and look at oh here's  
**[1:09:43-1:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:43):**  all the studies that involve watermelons and what types of chars were used.  
**[1:09:49-1:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:49):**  We can assemble that through various literature studies but we just don't have all of it compiled  
**[1:09:56-1:10:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:56):**  in that type of searchable database structure yet.  
**[1:10:03-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:03):**  So it's just try it maybe don't go too big in it and then just do what you can afford  
**[1:10:12-1:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:12):**  and look for your own results.  
**[1:10:13-1:10:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:13):**  I mean that's kind of the takeaway I keep coming back to.  
**[1:10:17-1:10:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:17):**  Correct and that's the only advice that we have is baby steps.  
**[1:10:21-1:10:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:21):**  Right well I want to appreciate or I want to thank you for coming on today and sharing

**[1:11:05-1:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-18-KurtSpokas-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:05):**  That's the best way to get started in it and if I can't handle or if it's outside of my

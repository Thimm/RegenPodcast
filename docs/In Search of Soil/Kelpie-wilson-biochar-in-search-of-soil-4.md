### In Search of Soil  (2020-11-04)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So Kelby, prior to getting into biochar,  what were you doing at the time?  Oh, a variety of things.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:09):**  I have a degree in mechanical engineering.  And so, I've always been interested in renewable energy,  but I was making my living just prior to biochar  
**[0:00:20-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  as a journalist, environmental journalist.  And before that, I had spent like 15 years  working in the forest protection movement  
**[0:00:28-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  in the Pacific Northwest.  So I was the director of an organization  called the Siskiyou Regional Education Project  
**[0:00:36-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  here in Southern Oregon.  And we led hikes, we tried to let people know  about the federal lands and that they were still being logged  
**[0:00:45-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  for the old growth treaties and promoted legislation  and lawsuits and the whole gamut of stuff.  I was a forest protection activist.  
**[0:00:56-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  And also, for the last 30 years,  I've been living in a small rural community,  growing my own food as much as I can.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  When it comes to biochar, what was the aha moment for you  that you said, hey, I need to pay attention to this,  whether that was through journalism  
**[0:01:14-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  and eventually becoming somebody who researches it,  really promotes it, who's done a lot of work advancing it.  What was the moment that really sent you off  
**[0:01:24-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  on that journey?  Well, I think it was in 2006  that I first heard about it.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  And I heard about it from, it was just in the news.  Soil scientists had discovered these dark soils  in the Amazon that were completely unexpected.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  They were not natural.  They were apparently made by humans.  And they were just learning about it and exploring it  
**[0:01:49-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  and learning about the agronomic implications of it.  And I came across that, I was writing for an online news  service called Truthout at the time.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  I was their environmental editor.  I came across that couple stories,  and I just, this was interesting.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:06):**  So I'm looking into it more and more,  and I wanted to write more stories about it,  but it was hard to find anything  
**[0:02:13-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:13):**  that was actually happening.  So I, but there was a conference coming up  in Australia in 2007, and it was the first,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  at that time they called it the International Agritar  Conference, and I begged one of my editors  to let me go there and cover that story, and they did.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  They paid me to go there.  I met a lot of Australians.  I met the soil scientists, and there was a big interest  
**[0:02:39-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  from the climate community too.  The climate change scientists were there  because they could immediately see the implications  
**[0:02:47-0:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  of this for climate where you could start creating  a pump, a biotic pump that would remove carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere, build it into plant tissues,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:58):**  and then if, instead of letting those plant tissues  go through their normal decay process  or go through a wildfire, where all the carbon,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:07):**  almost 99% of the carbon dioxide  goes back to the atmosphere.  I mean, that's good.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:11):**  That's the natural carbon cycle,  but if we could grow some excess biomass and char that,  then we could put that in the ground,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:19):**  and not only would it sequester carbon,  but it would also boost the carbon,  further carbon sequestration by further plant growth.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  So that's what you call a virtuous cycle,  and it's like a pump.  You could pump carbon dioxide out of the air  
**[0:03:36-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:36):**  and into the ground where it could do a lot of good.  So that really caught my imagination  because I was all about climate at that point.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  I'm very alarmed about it.  It worked for years protecting old-growth forests,  and then I could see, wow, forest health is plummeting.  
**[0:03:52-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  If we don't do something about climate,  drought, and heat, we're gonna lose these forests  that I just spent decades of my life trying to protect.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  So that was one big impetus to get involved in it.  And the other one was just personal.  Being a gardener and spending a lot of time  
**[0:04:10-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:10):**  hauling manure and trying to build soil,  I kind of looked at it and I thought,  this is like permanent compost.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:18):**  Now, wow!  So immediately, that's why I immediately  started going hands-on with it.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:25):**  I think a lot of people have similar stories.  I've had terra preta, Amazonian soils.  It really draws a lot of people in.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:34):**  Being involved in this for almost 15 years,  coming at it from a journalist background,  now a practitioner background,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:42):**  when you look at the total stuff  written about biochar today,  from the most scientific and legit to the claims,  
**[0:04:53-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  do you think that what's being said and talked about biochar  helps the biochar movement or hampers it?  Like a lot of media, mainstream media,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  I mean, we see this today, there's a lot of spin,  there's a lot of pushing agendas,  there's a lot of maybe not revealing all the facts  
**[0:05:11-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  and just kind of skewing stories in the direction we want.  I come at this from it as a healthy skeptic.  Like I use biochar, I want more about it,  
**[0:05:19-0:05:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  but I read some stuff on biochar  and sometimes it just makes me cringe when I read it.  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:26):**  Well, it's been an interesting journey.  I started working with the soil scientists  and the climate scientists.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:33):**  So after I came back from that conference,  I just wanted to do more stories about it.  So I couldn't see a lot of stories that are like,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  I need to do this full time.  So I contacted the group that had organized the conference,  which was now called the International Biochar Initiative.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  And I said, I do communications, can I help you?  And they hired me.  So for four years,  
**[0:05:55-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  I worked for the International Biochar Initiative.  I worked very closely with the top scientists  internationally on communications  
**[0:06:03-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  and developing information on the website.  And then the last big project I did for them  was biochar characterization standards document.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  So this is a multi-stakeholder process  where we just try to find out  what is important to know about biochar  
**[0:06:21-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  because number one thing you need to know about biochar  is it's not just one thing.  It's carbonized biomass, charcoal,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  comes in many different forms.  It depends on what it's made from,  the temperature it's made from,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  the other minerals and other constituents in it,  the amount of ash.  It's all gonna have really different impacts.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  So I think that's a lot of the reason  why there's confusion and out there about biochar.  Because some biochar will work here,  
**[0:06:54-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:54):**  and it won't work there.  And so you need a lot better information  on actually how to use it.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  What your application is.  Did you do a soil test?  Do you know what your soil needs?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  Because it's not just carbon,  there's ash and other, there's pH considerations.  So it's just not one thing.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:16):**  It's like saying fertilizer, is it good or is it bad?  It's still carbon.  That's it.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  And I know from talking to Gloria Flora,  that was one of her big frustrations around this  was she'd read studies and they would come to results  
**[0:07:31-0:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  that maybe weren't favorable in terms of biochar.  And she would talk to the people who did the studies  and they weren't even really sure  
**[0:07:37-0:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:37):**  what type of biochar they were starting with.  What temperature it was made from,  what the structure was, those types of things.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:43):**  And she's kind of like.  Early on there were a lot of studies like that.  I think they're getting better now.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:48):**  And there's some really interesting results  now coming out of Iowa State.  Researchers there are finding that when you add,  
**[0:07:59-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  and this is just on soil carbon,  when you add biochar to soil over long-term studies,  there were no long-term studies.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:07):**  Now we have more long-term studies.  That in six years the soil carbon doubled  beyond what the biochar contributed.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:18):**  So it had a stimulating effect to increase soil carbon.  So strictly from a climate standpoint,  that's really important.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  But there are things you can do to make biochar work.  Little tricks of the trade.  And that's what people need to know.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  And yes, there are a lot of home experimenters out there.  There are people just like me  who love to tinker around and play with stuff.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  And biochar's perfect for that.  I just got done teaching a three-day day camp  for middle school kids all about biochar.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  You know, a STEM camp, science, technology,  engineering, and math.  We did a little art project.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  And it's endless what you can learn.  Citizen science about biochar is so fun, easy to do.  Anybody can do it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:08):**  In fact, people have done for millennia  put charcoal in soils, not just in the Amazon.  Also in Africa there are extensive places  
**[0:09:19-0:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  where there are terra preta-like soils.  And even in Europe.  You know, one of the original researchers  
**[0:09:27-0:09:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:27):**  who looked at terra preta soils  was a Dutch researcher, scientist, Sombraak was his name.  And he talked about what he called Plagen soils  
**[0:09:39-0:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:39):**  in the Netherlands, which were black soils  that were made from refuse.  You know, people use biomass for heat and power.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:51):**  And often when you have a fire  you have little chunks of charcoal in it.  And so they would use that to sanitize  
**[0:09:58-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:58):**  their other organic waste, whether it's human waste  or food waste or anything like that.  And they'd have refuse areas.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  And those ended up being the fertile soils.  You know, it all happened the same way, I think,  in a lot of places in the world.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:11):**  And then people realized, some people realized,  oh, this is what we're doing and we could do it  deliberately and get more of these soils.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  So these Plagen soils, they called them,  in the Netherlands, were the, during World War II  there was food shortages everywhere.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:26):**  And he said his family survived  because of the Plagen soils on their farm.  And if they hadn't had that, they would've starved.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:35):**  So these black soils are everywhere.  The other thing that convinced me early on  that this is real and we need to look at it  
**[0:10:43-0:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:43):**  was natural biochar.  So if you look at the soils in Iowa,  they're called mollisols, they're similar to the soils  
**[0:10:51-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:51):**  in the Ukraine, the richest agricultural soils  in the world.  And what makes them that way?  
**[0:10:58-0:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  What makes them that way is they're step,  they're step grassland areas.  And so they're prairie fires.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:05):**  They come through naturally, you know,  in a cycle of every 10 years or so,  or maybe more frequent, I don't know.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  And what happens is those tall, tall, tall prairie grasses,  a fire flashes through, burns off the top part  of the gases, and the heat goes, radiates down,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  you know, into where the roots all bunch,  you know, the base of those bunch grasses,  and chars that.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  And then the fire moves on, so it goes out  before it turns to ash.  So you make a lot of char that way by burning a prairie.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  And so there's half of the carbon in Iowa soils  is charcoal from past prairie fires.  Yeah, the stories are just, they're really interesting.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  And looking at these natural examples,  and then trying to implement those in a human-made system,  I think is where we're at now.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  If you look at starting, working with some scientists  at the beginning, knowing that we have longer-term studies  right now, what are kind of some of the bullet points  
**[0:12:09-0:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  of where we're at now from the science side of things?  Because a lot of people are always like, you know,  pound on the table, show me the science, show me the science.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:16):**  So given today, with biochar research,  where do you think are kind of the unquestionable  or more or less scientific knowns at this point  
**[0:12:26-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  based upon work over the past few decades?  Let's see if I can summarize it.  Char itself, you know, we wanna know what the mechanisms are.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  What makes it do the things that it's claimed to do?  Keeping in mind that it won't do the same things  in every situation, but I think the,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  I always talk about three things  that it provides to microbes.  So it provides housing.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  So you've got all this surface area,  and it's got pores at every scale.  So it's got macropores because you take wood  
**[0:13:09-0:13:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  or even straw or something, and you char it,  the vascular structure and the cellular structure  is preserved in that char, and so all the carbon atoms  
**[0:13:20-0:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:20):**  link up when you char it and make a very strong,  I mean, it's brittle, but in some ways it's strong  in that it can't be broken down by microbes easily.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:29):**  And so you have all these little cell walls  and vascular pores and stuff, so it's very porous.  And then you even have nanoporosity,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  and that's just because of the way the carbon atoms,  the molecules kind of jumble up.  If you ever heard of carbon nanotubes,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:47):**  I mean, so there's also a whole nother realm  of applications for biochar that have to do  with material science.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:58):**  So char is being used in electronics,  as electricity conductor, it's being used  to block infrared radiation and even the microwave radiation  
**[0:14:19-0:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:19):**  because it has these really interesting electrical properties  so it's two things, porosity with surface area,  all those surfaces are electrically active.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  So that's what gives it cation exchange capacity,  for instance, and also it has this impact on microbes  where it promotes better, more efficient metabolism  
**[0:14:47-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:47):**  by something that's called diet,  direct interspecies electron transfer.  So it gives them a place to live, so surface area,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  because microbes like to, they say they like to sit down  when they eat, so they can attach to something,  and when they're sitting on the surface,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:06):**  that's got these electrical properties  because a carbon, aromatic carbon ring,  now a carbon molecule in char looks like a hexagon,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  it's a six-sided ring, and that's what they call  a benzene ring because it's really the basis  of so much organic chemistry, right?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:25):**  So it's, and the guy who first discovered it  discovered it as part of benzene,  which is one aromatic carbon ring  
**[0:15:35-0:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:35):**  with some other stuff on it,  I don't remember the formula for it.  And that's an interesting story, his name was Kekulie,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:44):**  this was back in the late 1800s,  and he was trying to figure out the structure of this carbon  and he had a dream about the ouroboros,  
**[0:15:54-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  which is the snake that eats its own tail,  and he woke up the next morning and he said, that's it.  What's happening with that ring is that electrons  
**[0:16:03-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  are free to circulate around it.  So that's what gives us the electrical properties.  So you have sheets and sheets of this stuff in the biochar.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  Some of you, some people may have heard of graphene,  that's another kind of high-tech nanomaterial,  they're making graphene tubes,  
**[0:16:20-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  and they just have really interesting electrical,  like semiconductor-type properties.  So yes, so those free electrons are there for microbes,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  and microbes can live on the surfaces  and they can access those electrons  because in their metabolism,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  sometimes they need an electron to complete a reaction,  a metabolic reaction.  And sometimes they need to give one up.  
**[0:16:53-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  And so when they're on this substrate that is conductive  and has free electrons,  they can not only improve their metabolic efficiency,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  but they can also more easily exchange electrons  with other microbes.  So you get increased diversity.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:11):**  And we all know that biological diversity  is how we get health, right?  Whether it's in our bodies or in the environment.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:20):**  So I would say one of the main things that biochar does  is it promotes microbial life and microbial diversity,  and you get more stable, more resilient soils from that.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:32):**  And a lot of people listening to this,  that's what they're after when it comes to char.  They're gardeners, they're homesteaders,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  they're farmers, and the soil either fuels them internally  because it's something that they enjoy,  or it's literally their livelihood.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:46):**  Looking at your work and thinking about projects  that you've done over the years,  can you talk about some stories or examples  
**[0:17:56-0:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:56):**  where you've seen agricultural soils really change  with the addition of char?  So I'm a gardener and an experimenter,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:07):**  and I'm not a commercial farmer.  I've certainly seen my garden soil change a lot,  and I could talk about how, what changes I've observed.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:21):**  There are some people who are starting to use biochar  in broad scale agriculture.  There certainly are people who are using it in horticulture,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:31):**  specifically vineyards, cannabis, nut and fruit trees,  blueberries, things like that.  I don't have personal experience with those.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:41):**  Well, even on a garden scale would be great,  just something you've seen.  Well, one of the projects, the biggest project  
**[0:18:47-0:18:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:47):**  that I have done that involved other people  was a conservation innovation grant from the NRCS.  And we got that grant in 2015,  
**[0:18:58-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:58):**  and we spent three years working with a group of enthusiasts  and also a group of small farmers to do biochar experiments.  But the whole focus of our grant was not on long-term  
**[0:19:12-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  field studies, we did some pot trials,  we did do a couple of field trials,  which are very difficult to do,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  but mostly we were looking at how to use biochar  to manage manure.  So that's the conclusion I came to quite a while ago,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:27):**  is that when you take charcoal straight out of a kiln,  it's not alive, it's a mineral, you know,  it's not a biological entity, it's a mineral.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:39):**  It's a mineral, and it can have some interesting effects  when you just, if you just add a lot of it right to soil,  straight out of the kiln, it's the sponge  
**[0:19:50-0:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  that starts absorbing things, right?  And it can temporarily tie up nitrogen just by absorbing it.  It can also temporarily tie up nitrogen if it has,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:00):**  you know, there's always two, there's several fractions  in each jar, the way you characterize it is by fractions.  So you have a fraction of stable carbon,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:09):**  which is, you know, what we think of as the char.  Then you have a fraction of labile carbon,  which is, you know, carbon that's not completely charred,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:20):**  it might be an oily kind of material,  still has hydrogen and oxygen in it,  that's micro food, microbes can eat that.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:28):**  And then you have ash.  So those are the three main fractions,  and ash is just some minerals, right?  
**[0:20:34-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:34):**  When you burn all the carbon out,  you're just left with this white powder,  which is the ash.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  So that labile carbon, some char,  have quite a lot of that, and if you put that in soil,  then it's like adding sawdust.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  You know, so you get the microbial bloom,  where the microbes go, oh wee, carbon,  now where's the nitrogen?  
**[0:20:53-0:21:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:53):**  And so they start robbing all the nitrogen,  and again, temporarily tying up nitrogen.  So a lot of people have gotten bad results from char,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:00):**  just because they didn't know how to use it.  They dumped a whole bunch of it right in the soil.  Like the first researchers, soil scientists even,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:08):**  they looked at the terraprata soils,  and they said, oh, there's 10 tons per hectare,  10 to 20 tons per hectare of char in these soils.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:16):**  Let's try that.  So they dumped 10 to 20 tons per hectare of char in a field,  and they get bad results, you know?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:25):**  And they're like,  because it created all at once.  It was created a little bit at a time,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  and it was mixed with other organics.  So the secret to using biotories,  put it in the compost first.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  It's really simple.  Anyway, so we did a lot of experiments  that really showed that, I think,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:45):**  pretty well with our project.  And so we worked with about a dozen small farmers,  and the idea was to, so we're in Oregon,  
**[0:21:55-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:55):**  so these were all farmers mostly who had some woody debris,  you know, timberland or slash piles.  We're always trying to deal with falling branches,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  dead trees, you know, there are fuels problem for us,  because we have forest fires.  So, because they're doing all this work anyway  
**[0:22:13-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:13):**  to manage this woody debris,  and usually putting it in a burn pile that they light off,  and it's smoky and not nice.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:23):**  So we designed and built kilns,  you know, what we call the Oregon kiln,  which is this pyramid kiln,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  and then another one called the Ring of Fire kiln,  which is just a cylinder.  And we really, I think, perfected some techniques  
**[0:22:36-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:36):**  for making char in these kilns.  And then we take the char,  and we'd use it in animal barns.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:46):**  So we had a goat dairy,  and they would sprinkle the char  on top of the bedding once a week.  
**[0:22:53-0:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:53):**  And noticeable improvements in odors, far less ammonia.  Animals seem to be healthier.  They're not exposed to that ammonia.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:03):**  And then the other thing is that the pack,  the manure pack, which in a goat dairy,  you know, they're not cleaning it out every day.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  They're cleaning it maybe two, three times a year.  And whereas before they'd have to wear a respirator  when they dug into that,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  because the ammonia was so intense.  Now it's compost, it's composting in place.  Much healthier for the animals.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  And so that's, you know,  if you have any kind of animals at all,  that's where you should start using your biochar.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  And then it cascades through the system.  I mean, this is a perfect permaculture item,  because it's your stacking functions all the way.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah, and you have some great white papers on this  at wilsonbiochar.com.  And I read that, and I'm like,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:51):**  oh, that's a great idea of putting it into the bedding.  And that's something I started doing in my chicken coop.  I had all this biochar around too.  
**[0:23:57-0:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  I'm like, what am I gonna do with all this?  I don't really have anywhere else  to put it in the soil right now.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:01):**  So I just started adding it to the chicken coop.  It does seem, it absorbs.  Chicken manure is very liquid,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  so the biochar wants to soak it up.  It's less bedding I'm buying.  It does take the smell.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  And we've also had a problem with a cat box lately.  And now I'm thinking, okay,  I'm gonna start adding it to my cat box,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:18):**  is just another way to pick up some of that ammonia smell.  So I love that aspect of it.  When you look at the soils,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:26):**  one thing that I find interesting  is this fractional analysis.  And you worked on some of this grading project  
**[0:24:33-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  for how biochar was classified.  In a perfect world, like if I was gonna create a lab  and a machine to make the best biochar for soil amendments,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  do you want the majority of that char to be stable carbon  with the least amount of labial carbon  and least amount of ash possible?  
**[0:24:52-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:52):**  Well, it does depend on your objective.  But yes, I've come to the conclusion  that the high temperature chars are definitely easier to use.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  So, okay, there's a difference between,  this is really easy, I think, for people to understand,  the difference between the biochar  
**[0:25:15-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:15):**  that we make at high temperature in a flame,  the flame cap kilns.  There are other processes too,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  like gasifiers or even most of the char  that's made commercially these days  is made in biomass power plants in a furnace.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:32):**  So it's actually made,  there's a lot of misconceptions about what pyrolysis is.  Pyrolysis being the process for making char.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:41):**  So you can make char in a retort  that's an enclosed vessel that's externally heated.  You have a little more control over that sometimes.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  Or you can make it in a flame  and you just adjust the process  so that you save the char.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:59):**  So use the flame to get the gas out of it and burn the gas.  And then once you've finished that first stage,  then you remove the char essentially from the air.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  So those are two processes.  And I've got webinars on my website  that people can look at if they want all the details,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:19):**  technical details about how those work.  But the flame process is always a high temperature process.  It's always gonna be about 1000 degrees centigrade.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  Whereas a retort process can be much lower temperature  because it's basically an oven  and you can turn it up any temperature you want.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:37):**  You're applying the heat externally.  And that's how barbecue charcoal is made or fuel charcoal.  So it's made, well it's actually a little bit  
**[0:26:48-0:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  of a hybrid process that I won't go into.  But it's made at low temperature and by cutting off air.  And so there's a lot of tar and oil in that stuff.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  And that is great for fuel.  Because it gives you more energy  to burn to cook your steak or whatever.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  But it can be good for soil.  It does have that problem of the microbial bloom  because it's a labile carbon.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  And it can also have some kind of toxic stuff  that can suppress plant growth.  It can also have some really interesting chemicals though.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  So for instance, one of the byproducts  of some charcoal making processes  is something called wood vinegar.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  So that's a condensate.  So you take the smoke basically,  the wet smoke from the first part of the burn  
**[0:27:39-0:27:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  where you're still taking water off.  And you condense that and you get this aqueous liquid.  So you get these water soluble chemicals.  
**[0:27:49-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:49):**  It's about five percent acetic acid.  So it's like pH about 1.5 I think or two.  And it's got all these chemicals  
**[0:28:02-0:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  that are growth stimulants.  So think about what happens after a fire,  the forest fire.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:11):**  You see that new growth coming back really quickly.  Part of that is because of those smoke chemicals.  Their growth stimulants.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  So some people are actually capturing that  and selling that for an agricultural amendment.  And it promotes microbes eating.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:32):**  I think the chemical that promotes growth  is called caricane.  And then it can also,  
**[0:28:39-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  if you dilute it at different strengths,  it can be used as a pesticide.  It's good for powdery mildew  
**[0:28:46-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  and other kinds of fungicide.  So they can have some benefits,  low temperature charcoal can have some benefits.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  So you just need to understand it  and what it does and how to use it  and what you want to accomplish with your char.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  So a high temperature char is essentially a more pure char.  It's a higher carbon percentage.  Yeah, a high temperature char is usually  
**[0:29:16-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  at least 75% up to 85 or even 90% pure carbon.  And a lower temperature char might be 50% carbon.  And yeah.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:29):**  Well, one of the concerns that I have had come up  when people have heard me talk about it is they're like,  what about the process?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:36):**  Can it produce toxic compounds, dioxins, things like that?  If you are burning at these higher temperatures,  what are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:29:44-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  Are you gonna end up with toxic compounds  potentially in the char?  No, not really.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:53):**  There's a few circumstances where it can happen.  One thing that probably needs to be looked at is  if the wood has a lot of salt in it,  
**[0:30:02-0:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:02):**  like if it was beechwood now from the beach  or if it had been near the ocean and I had salt spray.  Chlorine is a known precursor of dioxins,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:15):**  so you'd want to look at that.  But the high temperature processes generally,  dioxins may be created,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:27):**  but they're usually destroyed immediately.  So it's really complicated.  There's different pathways that can form dioxins.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:38):**  Right now, I did a paper on it.  It's on the IDI website on dioxin formation.  And it's just, you know,  
**[0:30:48-0:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  it's not very likely that you're gonna find any dioxins  especially in the low tech kind of processes.  Some higher tech processes may be, but no.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  There is something called a PAH,  a polyaromatic hydrocarbon.  And there is a whole class of chemicals.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  And you'll find some of those in some biochars.  But they are, first of all, most of them are harmless.  In fact, you know, biotarch itself is a PAH,  
**[0:31:22-0:31:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  a polyaromatic hydrocarbon.  So it's just, there's like 18 of them  that are short chain molecules that can be toxic.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:34):**  And I think some of the lower temperature charts  are more likely to have them than the high temperature charts  that we have.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:42):**  So, you know, the biotarch that we make in kilns,  in open flame, you know, the flame gap kilns is very safe.  In terms of controlling temperature of the burn,  
**[0:31:55-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:55):**  are the main factors in that moisture content in the wood  when you start, the amount of available oxygen  to get at the flame at the top,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  and then how you're layering the pile  along with like maybe size of material?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  You know, you don't want smoldering combustion.  Smoldering combustion is cool.  You wanna keep a good hot flame there,  
**[0:32:18-0:32:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:18):**  it burns the smoke so you're not polluting the air as much.  And it keeps the temperature high.  If you don't have a flame, then you're cooling down.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:30):**  Sure.  What about in terms of feedstock?  Let's say we burned and made biochar out of rice hulls,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  softwood like a pine,  and then something that burns really hot and hard  like black locust.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:44):**  We're gonna end up with char at the end of all those,  assuming we manage the fire appropriately.  What do you think is gonna be the difference  
**[0:32:53-0:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  between those chars?  Well, the wood chars mainly differ by density.  So, you know, your black locust  
**[0:33:05-0:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:05):**  is probably more dense than your pine.  So it'll be different by density.  That's the main thing.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:13):**  Because if you cook it hot,  you know, all the other distinguishing chemistry  of the wood species is gonna be cooked away,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:22):**  burned away in the flame.  So, I mean, your goal is to get the carbon.  The ash content will be different.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:30):**  You know, you'll have, because different species  will have different kind of metals in them  that they take up,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:36):**  which can also vary by where it's grown.  So that's another thing.  If you're doing like phytoremediation on an old mine site,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  trying to take up, I don't know, mercury or zinc  or something, I don't know,  and then you burn that,  
**[0:33:53-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  you might end up with toxic levels of heavy metals  in your char.  So, you know, that's another consideration.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  Then rice hulls, crop waste is usually straws  and hulls and things like that are usually quite different.  They'll have much higher ash content.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:11):**  Rice hulls are particularly interesting  because they have a lot of silica.  And if you char those at high temperature,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  you can actually get some little,  they call them cristobalites, little crystals of silica  that are like glass.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  And those can be dangerous to breathe.  So like, almost like asbestos.  So rice hulls you need to be careful with.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  But on the other hand, they're very easy to char  because each rice hull is surrounded  by this little silica envelope.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  So it's like a mini retort.  So, you know, the carbon inside chars really easily  because it's protected from the air by the silica shell.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:57):**  And they're, carbonized rice hulls are used a lot in Asia.  Do you think that, you know, you work with what you have,  that's always kind of the best choice.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  You're in forest country, there's a lot of brush  and wood around you to burn.  For somebody who has a lot of ag waste,  
**[0:35:15-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:15):**  do you think that they're, in terms of the soil,  do you think they're equal one for one?  Like if you had your pick and really sourcing  
**[0:35:24-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  wasn't a factor and they were two piles in front of you,  a pile of rice hull biochar, a pile of biochar  from made from woody debris,  
**[0:35:33-0:35:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  is there one you would lean towards  just given your experience?  Well, what are you growing?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:39):**  Let's say we're just growing vegetables.  You know, I just don't have any experience with crop waste.  So I can't give you any direct experience.  
**[0:35:49-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  I do know a lot of researchers feel like straw  and right and, you know, crop waste chars are better.  Will give you more of a fertilizer effect, in other words,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  because you do have more ash.  Ash and those minerals are nutrients.  If you are, so first I'm trying to, you know,  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  mention this to a few of the cannabis growers  that I know around here,  because we're a hot spot for that,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  that, you know, they're spending all this money on inputs  and then at the end of the season  they have all these hemp stalks  
**[0:36:22-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:22):**  and a lot of them just burn them, get rid of them,  take them away, they don't know what they're doing.  And I'm like, you know, you should at least compost them  
**[0:36:32-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  and if you make them into char,  you know, that plant took up all those inputs you paid for  and at least the mineral ones are still gonna be there.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:45):**  So, you know, you can recycle back into the soil.  So, you know, if you're growing a monocrop every year,  why not, you know, conserve your,  
**[0:36:58-0:37:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:58):**  their minerals that can be conserved in the char  rather than buying them again.  Yeah, and thinking of ash content,  
**[0:37:06-0:37:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:06):**  so when you make the char,  you can somewhat, I think, control how much ash  is left on there or by how much you rinse it  
**[0:37:15-0:37:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:15):**  in the quench process.  Can you talk a little bit about the importance  of quenching biochar and its effect on the pores in the char  
**[0:37:23-0:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:23):**  and the rinsing of ash off of the char?  Well, again, it really depends on your purpose  and where you are, what your soils need.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:35):**  Here in a forested region on the Pacific coast,  our soils tend to be acidic  because we get a lot of rain, right,  
**[0:37:45-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  which makes for more acid soils.  So ash is not a problem, you know.  I don't worry about it, trying to rinse it at all,  
**[0:37:55-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  especially since I'm putting it in the compost first.  However, where you have alkaline soils,  you need to be very careful  
**[0:38:02-0:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  because it has a whining impact, right?  And if your soil's already pH eight  and you had a pH nine biochar with ash in it,  
**[0:38:15-0:38:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:15):**  you're not gonna be happy with the results.  So that's, again, another reason to compost it first  because the pH will neutralize after composting.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  Because microbes live in there,  they deposit organic acids,  the organic acids also now create anion exchange capacity.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  Char is like a seed for humus  and that's how you should use it,  is to grow humus and then put it in the soil.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:47):**  That's what I think.  So rinsing, not rinsing, you know,  if you are in a, you know,  
**[0:38:58-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  in eastern Oregon or in the desert,  you know, where soils are alkaline,  yes, you probably wanna try and rinse it if you can first.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:07):**  And then put it in your compost  because your compost might be a bit alkaline too.  You can use other organics, you know,  
**[0:39:18-0:39:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:18):**  to bring the pH down.  Well, knowing that and knowing that  there's a lot of different methods  
**[0:39:27-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:27):**  that people could be making biochar,  including people getting it from biomass plants,  there's a lot of companies selling biochar now.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  And it's one of those things,  people hear biochar, they see it on the bag,  they buy it and I'm thinking,  
**[0:39:42-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:42):**  well, they're not all created equal.  If you're purchasing biochar from company X,  are there questions you think you should be asking  
**[0:39:52-0:40:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  or things you should be looking for  when you buy them to ensure that you're getting something  that's maybe a higher quality or better?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  Yeah, you should ask for that fractional analysis.  What's the percentage of stable carbon?  What's the percentage of degradable carbon or labile carbon?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:12):**  What's the percentage of ash?  What is the feedstock?  Is it made from wood?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:19):**  And ask about the process.  Ask about the temperature that it's made at.  Although, you know, if you know the fractional analysis,  
**[0:40:26-0:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:26):**  you have a pretty good idea of that.  So you wanna know what it's made from  and what's the fractional analysis.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  And those are the main things you need to know.  If you can get information on surface area,  that's good too.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:41):**  So, you know, the other thing is that biochar is,  or charcoal, charred organic matter is a continuum of stuff.  You know, I've already talked about the fuel charcoal  
**[0:40:52-0:41:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:52):**  at low temperature and then, you know,  we got the high temperature chars that are more porous  and more pure carbon.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  Then over here, you now get into these engineered materials  like activated carbons.  So activated carbons are used in filtration.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  And there's a whole activated carbon industry.  And there's all kinds of properties.  These things can be tuned to absorb  
**[0:41:18-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  specific chemicals or metals.  And that's a very active area of biochar research actually  is because those markets actually exist.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  You know, they've been around for a while.  They're very robust markets.  There's a lot of it sold, you know,  
**[0:41:38-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:38):**  whether it's for filtering water in your aquarium  or fish tank or whether it's, you know,  a water treatment plant is filtering drinking water  
**[0:41:46-0:41:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:46):**  for a city.  Activated carbons are a big market.  And some of these biochars, they're finding  
**[0:41:53-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:53):**  are work really almost as well,  sometimes better than some of the engineered carbons  which are usually made from coal.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:02):**  So that's a whole nother area of biochar research.  And it's kind of further on that spectrum.  Yeah, for people that are interested  
**[0:42:14-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  in adding biochars to their soil,  I think one of the best ways to do it  is to get out there and make it from a simple pit kiln  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  that you can just dig in the soil  to some of the more, I'll call them advanced,  although they're not super complex.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:28):**  This is not like building a computer  of the like the fire cap kiln.  You have cone kilns, pyramid kilns, that Oregon kiln.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:36):**  You have plans for all that on wilsonbiochar.com.  What do you think is a great way for a beginner  to start out if they wanna make some biochar?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:45):**  They maybe don't have great fabrication skills.  They don't wanna dump a bunch of money in it right away  cause they're not sure if they're gonna be into this.  
**[0:42:52-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  How would you advise people start?  You know, the easiest, quickest way  to make a lot of biochar is to have some small brush.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  So, you know, whatever's growing around  that's a problem for you that's just small brush  that most of those stems are about the size,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  no thicker than your pinky.  You know, maybe basically finger size stuff and smaller.  And you could take, if you had some old roofing steel,  
**[0:43:20-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:20):**  just lay it out on the ground and make a surface,  a metal surface, pile your brush on that  and kinda compress it.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  Can't be too loose.  So compress it down as much as you can.  Light it on top.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:37):**  Let it burn down until it's that glowing coal stage  and it's just starting to ash.  And then put it out with water.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:46):**  It goes quick cause it's small.  And when you put it on that metal plaque,  you know, underneath it, that reflects the heat back.  
**[0:43:56-0:44:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  So it's much more efficient.  And then it goes out easily and then it's sitting  on these metal sheets and you can scoop it up easily.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:05):**  It's already a pretty small particle size  so you don't really have to do much to crush it up,  although you can crush it further if you want.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  That's the easiest way I found to make a lot  of barter quickly with very little trouble.  And if you don't have metal sheets,  
**[0:44:21-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:21):**  just do it on the ground, you know.  But basically just a top lit burn pile.  If you want to do a shallow pit,  
**[0:44:29-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  it doesn't need to be a big pit.  Just even a little shallow pit will help.  But the key thing is the feedstock, small brush.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:42):**  Another way you could do it if you don't have much,  you just wanna play around with it,  and maybe you don't have the ability to burn a pile  
**[0:44:50-0:45:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:50):**  because you're in town or in the suburbs.  You've got a kettle grill.  You have a kettle grill in your backyard on your deck?  
**[0:45:00-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:00):**  You can make biochar.  So you just cut off the, you know,  this would be for a charcoal grill, not a gas grill.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  But you close the air holes in the bottom,  you get some little wood chunks, little sticks,  make a little kind of open rick, light it on top,  
**[0:45:20-0:45:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:20):**  let it burn down if you want.  You've got time to quickly cook a hot dog  or a shish kebab or something  
**[0:45:28-0:45:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:28):**  while it's in the charcoal stage.  And then you can either put it out with water  or you can dump it in a metal can with a lid  
**[0:45:35-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:35):**  and snuff it that way.  So you can make small amounts of biochar like that.  You can make it every time you cook.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:42):**  You know, you don't have to buy charcoal.  You can just make it and use it  and then save some of it for the soil.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  Burning from the top versus burning from the bottom.  Most of these vessels, you know,  there's some sort of shape.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  And in a traditional fire,  if you're gonna start a campfire,  you know, you're building your fire down here  
**[0:46:02-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:02):**  and then you're adding wood  and it's potentially building up here.  You look at some of the diagrams on sites like yours,  
**[0:46:09-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  you have this vessel, it's empty.  We're gonna fill it with dry brush.  We're gonna light it up here.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  It's gonna burn its way down,  creates an ash and a flame cap at the top.  Then we're gonna start adding our new material to that  
**[0:46:21-0:46:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  once that's all burned.  What's the significance of burning from the top?  Why that and why not start at the bottom,  
**[0:46:28-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  get a fire going and layer up?  This is quicker.  I mean, you,  
**[0:46:37-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  and I've used to do it that way  where I put a small fire in the kiln.  It would just take a long time to build up the heat.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:43):**  Take the whole extra hour.  So by making them a kind of loose rick,  and if you make it too big,  
**[0:46:49-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  you won't be able, it won't burn all the way down.  So, you know, lots of times I've ended up  with some unburned stuff in the bottom.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  But that's not a problem.  But still, you know, if you kind of fill it fairly full  with smaller stuff, it will, you know,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:10):**  it starts doing that thing where it sucks air from the top.  Where in making biochar,  where do you think people make mistakes?  
**[0:47:21-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  Where are they getting it wrong?  You teach a lot of workshops.  You've seen a lot of this.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  Are there common things people do wrong  on the production side?  So not inoculating it, not composting it first,  
**[0:47:33-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:33):**  but on the production side.  Well, I think we're all learning, you know,  and everybody has different feedstocks.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  I think the main thing that's gonna give you better results  is to make sure your biomass is dry and not too big.  So, you know, I see people trying to push a big log  
**[0:47:52-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:52):**  into a kiln, and it's, you know,  it doesn't sustain, a big wet log won't sustain the flame.  If it burns at all, it'll smolder.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  From a fuel standpoint, you know,  fuel reduction standpoint, you know,  where we're just trying, we're out in the forest  
**[0:48:09-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  and we've got, you know, yard, you know,  just piles and piles of brush  that we just have to treat and deal with.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:18):**  People will put big logs in those piles  and there's no need from a fuel standpoint  to try to burn, you know, an eight inch diameter log  
**[0:48:28-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  because it's not a fuel danger.  It's the small brush, it's the limbs.  Those are the things we wanna burn.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  So keep it small and keep it dry  and you should be successful.  And always keep a flame on top  
**[0:48:40-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  because if you start loading it too fast,  the flame will die down, it'll start getting smoke.  So as soon as you get smoke, hold off, you know,  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  let the flame come back up.  So in a perfect burn, I mean,  this is one concern people have  
**[0:48:54-0:48:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  that aren't knowledgeable about it.  They're like, you're putting all that smoke  and particulate it into the air,  
**[0:48:58-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:58):**  but in a efficient, clean burn,  there is no to minimal smoke  and there was no particulate  
**[0:49:04-0:49:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  as it's all being burned off.  Well, I mean, there's some, but yeah.  You're not gonna see it from miles away.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:13):**  You just broke.  I think we're having a little glitch here.  So now it's happening.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:22):**  Can you hear me now?  Hello?  Yes.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:27):**  Okay, yeah.  I'm not sure what that was, a Skype thing.  I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna take him,  
**[0:49:31-0:49:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:31):**  and I'm just gonna go close the door here.  Sure.  And I know you have about 10 minutes,  
**[0:49:42-0:49:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:42):**  so I'm winding it down here.  Okay, so yes, in a perfect burn,  you would always keep a strong flame on top.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:52):**  You would have a windscreen,  which I have found makes a big difference.  I have a new kiln design.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  I'm calling the deluxe Ring of Fire.  We just started producing those this spring,  and we tested them out with,  
**[0:50:08-0:50:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  we had a bunch of high school kids  who were home from school with nothing to do.  So we went around in our neighborhood,  
**[0:50:16-0:50:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:16):**  and we just charred all the neighbors' burnt piles.  And so it was a great service for them,  and this new kiln, it's got an extra screen around it.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:28):**  So it's a Ring of Fire with an extra windscreen,  and it really dramatically improves the efficiency  and the emissions, at least visually,  
**[0:50:38-0:50:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  because you got a preheated air coming up  in the annular space between the two rings,  and that preheated air helps feed the flame.  
**[0:50:51-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:51):**  And it's a little taller as opposed to the Oregon kiln.  And so the fire kind of stays down in the hole.  And so the smoke really burns a lot better,  
**[0:51:05-0:51:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  and I'm really liking the way this kiln is working.  That's cool.  People can see pics of that on the website.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:12):**  Let's say now we're done burning.  What are your thoughts on reducing particle size at the end?  You're gonna have chunky stuff.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  You're gonna have finer stuff.  Do you think it's important?  People obsess on this, it needs to be powderish,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:27):**  it needs to look like rice,  it can't look like bigger things like dog food.  What are your thoughts on particle size?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  Well, you know, finer biochar has more immediate impact  because if you're a microbe,  even a tiny little powder piece of char is really big.  
**[0:51:50-0:52:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:50):**  Right, so it gives the microbes more access.  But char can do different things.  It's not just home for microbes,  
**[0:52:00-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:00):**  it also holds water and air,  and it can help loosen soil, give it better tills.  I like to put chunks of biochar in the bottom of pots,  
**[0:52:16-0:52:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:16):**  potted plants for drainage.  And actually to hold water and allow water to drain  kind of does both things,  
**[0:52:25-0:52:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:25):**  but keeping the right water, a moisture level, and air  so that your pots don't get anaerobic.  So, you know, in my garden I have some chunks  
**[0:52:38-0:52:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:38):**  and I have some vines,  a variety of particle sizes, perfectly good.  Yeah, so knowing that, the other thing is dosage  
**[0:52:49-0:52:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  or rate of application.  Do you think that there's an amount people should look at  to start with if, you know, not go overboard,  
**[0:52:59-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:59):**  that whatever 10 tons per hectare,  but you also want enough to potentially see  some sort of result.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  Where do you think that middle ground is to say,  I'm serious enough to give this a shot,  I'm gonna do enough to put it there to make an impact,  
**[0:53:15-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:15):**  but we're not going overboard.  It depends so much on your soil, okay, it really does.  But when I'm doing veggie starch or making a potting soil mix  
**[0:53:29-0:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:29):**  I'm depending on how much other stuff is in the soil mix,  like how much other fertilizer,  I might put 20% char, that would be a lot,  
**[0:53:43-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:43):**  get results with less.  The critical thing is compost.  It's really interesting that you could see a big difference,  
**[0:53:53-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:53):**  and I've done a lot of compost experiments  between five and 10% char.  You know, whereas five percent might make a compost pile  
**[0:54:04-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  really heat up, 10% might cool it down a little bit.  In the end you still get great compost,  but you can really see, it's like an air fuel mixture  
**[0:54:15-0:54:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  in a carburetor, you know, you can get the mixture  rich or lean and it has different impacts on the engine.  Yeah, so again, it invokes the citizen scientists  
**[0:54:26-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:26):**  to do their own work, to try things.  You've done a lot of work promoting and helping people  learn more about biochar.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:34):**  WilsonBiochar.com is your website,  you have plans there for killing,  you have a lot of great information, you do workshops.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  Beyond that, is there any place else people you think  can go to learn more, either other places  that you're connected with or just other great resources  
**[0:54:49-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  out there about all things biochar?  Yeah, please do go to my website,  I do have a lot of free ebooks.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  I also have what I call the biochar cookbook,  which is my own personal tips and tricks for using biochar.  And the other place I would send people  
**[0:55:08-0:55:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:08):**  would be the US Biochar Initiative.  So it's US Biochar, USBI.  Gosh, I'm not remembering the website URL right now,  
**[0:55:20-0:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:20):**  I think it's USBiochar.org, I can't remember.  Anyway, I'm on the board of that organization,  we've been around for about 10 years.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:27):**  We've been the group that's organized the biochar conferences  in the US, every couple years we have a biochar conference,  we had one in Colorado last year.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:36):**  And we're kinda gearing up right now,  starting to get a little more funding,  and one of my projects as a board member  
**[0:55:46-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:46):**  is going to be to work on our educational resources.  Because for the industry,  the people are actually trying to make a living,  
**[0:55:53-0:56:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  being providers of biochar,  they're running into all these things  that you're talking about where people are very confused,  
**[0:56:00-0:56:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:00):**  there's some bad information out,  or incorrect information out there  that people are picking up on,  
**[0:56:07-0:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:07):**  and there's just very little guidance.  Actually there are a lot of good resources,  but they're scattered, and if you're new to it,  
**[0:56:17-0:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  you have no idea what's good and what's not.  So what we're going to be doing is curating that.  So we'll be looking at a lot of the stuff that's out there,  
**[0:56:26-0:56:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:26):**  and picking out the stuff that's really good,  and helpful, and putting it on the website,  and that should help ultimately build markets  
**[0:56:37-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:37):**  for the biochar suppliers.  So you can't put it in the ground if you can't buy it.  Unless you can make it yourself,  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  which of course a lot of our permaculture roots can do.  Even if you're making it yourself,  you still need guidance on how to use it.  
**[0:56:54-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  All right, okay, so that's it for the interview.  One quick takeaway here,  and I'm going to use this potentially in the edit,  
**[0:57:03-0:57:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  is how would you define biochar?  Biochar's just charcoal that you can put in soil.  It's charcoal that's friendly to biology.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:15):**  So it's charcoal that it's appropriate to use  for a soil purpose,  and that's how, that's really,  
**[0:57:25-0:57:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:25):**  I wouldn't define it any further than that,  because it's going to be different,  depending on your soil, depending on your crop,  
**[0:57:32-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:32):**  what's appropriate.  Okay, one other quick one here,  so if anything comes to mind,  
**[0:57:37-0:57:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:37):**  is there one thing that is a mind blower to you  when it comes to biochar?  Or maybe not to you, but to somebody else.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:49):**  Oh, okay, well the thing that kind of blew my mind,  I mean, I was got intrigued by it  because of the carbon climate implications,  
**[0:57:59-0:58:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  and it started to seem really important,  and I was, and also for my personal use in my garden,  which I grow a pretty great garden, I gotta say.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  The thing that really blew my mind scientifically  was the electrical properties of char  that I already talked about,  
**[0:58:18-0:58:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  and the way that, how important that is.  I had no idea that microbes used electrons.  I had no idea.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:27):**  I'm an engineer and not a biologist,  so I was like, wow, that's pretty cool.  Right, right.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:34):**  Okay, perfect.  Well, this is all really good stuff.  I think it'll help add to the library  
**[0:58:40-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:40):**  of good information out there,  help educate people on this.  I'll send you a link when this is out.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  We're probably looking at fall.  I'm recording ahead, so it's gonna be after September.  I'll link to your website and everything on there  
**[0:58:56-0:59:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:56):**  and anything else that you mentioned,  but again, I wanna thank you for carving out some time.  I know we've set this up a while ago,  
**[0:59:01-0:59:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:01):**  so if we're doing this in the future, I appreciate it.  Thanks again.

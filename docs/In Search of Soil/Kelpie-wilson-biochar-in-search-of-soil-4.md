### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 10:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So Kelby, prior to getting into biochar,  
**[0:00:04-0:00:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:04):**  what were you doing at the time?  
**[0:00:07-0:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:07):**  Oh, a variety of things.  
**[0:00:09-0:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:09):**  I have a degree in mechanical engineering.  
**[0:00:11-0:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:11):**  And so, I've always been interested in renewable energy,  
**[0:00:17-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:17):**  but I was making my living just prior to biochar  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  as a journalist, environmental journalist.  
**[0:00:23-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:23):**  And before that, I had spent like 15 years  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  working in the forest protection movement  
**[0:00:28-0:00:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:28):**  in the Pacific Northwest.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:29):**  So I was the director of an organization  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  called the Siskiyou Regional Education Project  
**[0:00:36-0:00:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  here in Southern Oregon.  
**[0:00:37-0:00:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:37):**  And we led hikes, we tried to let people know  
**[0:00:41-0:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:41):**  about the federal lands and that they were still being logged  
**[0:00:45-0:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:45):**  for the old growth treaties and promoted legislation  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:49):**  and lawsuits and the whole gamut of stuff.  
**[0:00:52-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:52):**  I was a forest protection activist.  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  And also, for the last 30 years,  
**[0:00:58-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  I've been living in a small rural community,  
**[0:01:03-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:03):**  growing my own food as much as I can.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  When it comes to biochar, what was the aha moment for you  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:09):**  that you said, hey, I need to pay attention to this,  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:12):**  whether that was through journalism  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  and eventually becoming somebody who researches it,  
**[0:01:17-0:01:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:17):**  really promotes it, who's done a lot of work advancing it.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:21):**  What was the moment that really sent you off  
**[0:01:24-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:24):**  on that journey?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  Well, I think it was in 2006  
**[0:01:28-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:28):**  that I first heard about it.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  And I heard about it from, it was just in the news.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  Soil scientists had discovered these dark soils  
**[0:01:40-0:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:40):**  in the Amazon that were completely unexpected.  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  They were not natural.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  They were apparently made by humans.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:46):**  And they were just learning about it and exploring it  
**[0:01:49-0:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  and learning about the agronomic implications of it.  
**[0:01:53-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:53):**  And I came across that, I was writing for an online news  
**[0:01:58-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:58):**  service called Truthout at the time.  
**[0:02:00-0:02:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  I was their environmental editor.  
**[0:02:01-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:01):**  I came across that couple stories,  
**[0:02:03-0:02:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  and I just, this was interesting.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:06):**  So I'm looking into it more and more,  
**[0:02:07-0:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  and I wanted to write more stories about it,  
**[0:02:11-0:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:11):**  but it was hard to find anything  
**[0:02:13-0:02:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:13):**  that was actually happening.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:15):**  So I, but there was a conference coming up  
**[0:02:17-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:17):**  in Australia in 2007, and it was the first,  
**[0:02:21-0:02:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  at that time they called it the International Agritar  
**[0:02:24-0:02:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:24):**  Conference, and I begged one of my editors  
**[0:02:27-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:27):**  to let me go there and cover that story, and they did.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  They paid me to go there.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:35):**  I met a lot of Australians.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:36):**  I met the soil scientists, and there was a big interest  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  from the climate community too.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:42):**  The climate change scientists were there  
**[0:02:44-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  because they could immediately see the implications  
**[0:02:47-0:02:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  of this for climate where you could start creating  
**[0:02:50-0:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:50):**  a pump, a biotic pump that would remove carbon dioxide  
**[0:02:54-0:02:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:54):**  from the atmosphere, build it into plant tissues,  
**[0:02:58-0:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:58):**  and then if, instead of letting those plant tissues  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:01):**  go through their normal decay process  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:03):**  or go through a wildfire, where all the carbon,  
**[0:03:07-0:03:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:07):**  almost 99% of the carbon dioxide  
**[0:03:09-0:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  goes back to the atmosphere.  
**[0:03:10-0:03:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:10):**  I mean, that's good.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:11):**  That's the natural carbon cycle,  
**[0:03:13-0:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:13):**  but if we could grow some excess biomass and char that,  
**[0:03:17-0:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  then we could put that in the ground,  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:19):**  and not only would it sequester carbon,  
**[0:03:21-0:03:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  but it would also boost the carbon,  
**[0:03:25-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:25):**  further carbon sequestration by further plant growth.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  So that's what you call a virtuous cycle,  
**[0:03:32-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  and it's like a pump.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:34):**  You could pump carbon dioxide out of the air  
**[0:03:36-0:03:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:36):**  and into the ground where it could do a lot of good.  
**[0:03:39-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:39):**  So that really caught my imagination  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  because I was all about climate at that point.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  I'm very alarmed about it.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  It worked for years protecting old-growth forests,  
**[0:03:47-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  and then I could see, wow, forest health is plummeting.  
**[0:03:52-0:03:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:52):**  If we don't do something about climate,  
**[0:03:55-0:03:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:55):**  drought, and heat, we're gonna lose these forests  
**[0:03:57-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:57):**  that I just spent decades of my life trying to protect.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  So that was one big impetus to get involved in it.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  And the other one was just personal.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:08):**  Being a gardener and spending a lot of time  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:10):**  hauling manure and trying to build soil,  
**[0:04:13-0:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  I kind of looked at it and I thought,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:17):**  this is like permanent compost.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:18):**  Now, wow!  
**[0:04:21-0:04:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:21):**  So immediately, that's why I immediately  
**[0:04:23-0:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:23):**  started going hands-on with it.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:25):**  I think a lot of people have similar stories.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:28):**  I've had terra preta, Amazonian soils.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:31):**  It really draws a lot of people in.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:34):**  Being involved in this for almost 15 years,  
**[0:04:38-0:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:38):**  coming at it from a journalist background,  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:39):**  now a practitioner background,  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:42):**  when you look at the total stuff  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:48):**  written about biochar today,  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:50):**  from the most scientific and legit to the claims,  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  do you think that what's being said and talked about biochar  
**[0:04:58-0:05:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:58):**  helps the biochar movement or hampers it?  
**[0:05:02-0:05:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:02):**  Like a lot of media, mainstream media,  
**[0:05:04-0:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:04):**  I mean, we see this today, there's a lot of spin,  
**[0:05:06-0:05:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:06):**  there's a lot of pushing agendas,  
**[0:05:08-0:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:08):**  there's a lot of maybe not revealing all the facts  
**[0:05:11-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:11):**  and just kind of skewing stories in the direction we want.  
**[0:05:14-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:14):**  I come at this from it as a healthy skeptic.  
**[0:05:16-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:16):**  Like I use biochar, I want more about it,  
**[0:05:19-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  but I read some stuff on biochar  
**[0:05:21-0:05:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  and sometimes it just makes me cringe when I read it.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:24):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:05:26-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:26):**  Well, it's been an interesting journey.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  I started working with the soil scientists  
**[0:05:32-0:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  and the climate scientists.  
**[0:05:33-0:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:33):**  So after I came back from that conference,  
**[0:05:37-0:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:37):**  I just wanted to do more stories about it.  
**[0:05:39-0:05:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:39):**  So I couldn't see a lot of stories that are like,  
**[0:05:42-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42):**  I need to do this full time.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  So I contacted the group that had organized the conference,  
**[0:05:47-0:05:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:47):**  which was now called the International Biochar Initiative.  
**[0:05:50-0:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:50):**  And I said, I do communications, can I help you?  
**[0:05:53-0:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:53):**  And they hired me.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:54):**  So for four years,  
**[0:05:55-0:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:55):**  I worked for the International Biochar Initiative.  
**[0:05:57-0:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:57):**  I worked very closely with the top scientists  
**[0:06:00-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:00):**  internationally on communications  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  and developing information on the website.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:06):**  And then the last big project I did for them  
**[0:06:09-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:09):**  was biochar characterization standards document.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  So this is a multi-stakeholder process  
**[0:06:16-0:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:16):**  where we just try to find out  
**[0:06:18-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:18):**  what is important to know about biochar  
**[0:06:21-0:06:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  because number one thing you need to know about biochar  
**[0:06:24-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:24):**  is it's not just one thing.  
**[0:06:27-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  It's carbonized biomass, charcoal,  
**[0:06:31-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  comes in many different forms.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  It depends on what it's made from,  
**[0:06:35-0:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:35):**  the temperature it's made from,  
**[0:06:37-0:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:37):**  the other minerals and other constituents in it,  
**[0:06:39-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:39):**  the amount of ash.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  It's all gonna have really different impacts.  
**[0:06:43-0:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:43):**  So I think that's a lot of the reason  
**[0:06:45-0:06:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:45):**  why there's confusion and out there about biochar.  
**[0:06:51-0:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:51):**  Because some biochar will work here,  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:54):**  and it won't work there.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:57):**  And so you need a lot better information  
**[0:07:00-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:00):**  on actually how to use it.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  What your application is.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:03):**  Did you do a soil test?  
**[0:07:05-0:07:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:05):**  Do you know what your soil needs?  
**[0:07:07-0:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:07):**  Because it's not just carbon,  
**[0:07:08-0:07:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  there's ash and other, there's pH considerations.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:13):**  So it's just not one thing.  
**[0:07:16-0:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:16):**  It's like saying fertilizer, is it good or is it bad?  
**[0:07:21-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:21):**  It's still carbon.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  That's it.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  And I know from talking to Gloria Flora,  
**[0:07:25-0:07:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:25):**  that was one of her big frustrations around this  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:28):**  was she'd read studies and they would come to results  
**[0:07:31-0:07:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:31):**  that maybe weren't favorable in terms of biochar.  
**[0:07:33-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:33):**  And she would talk to the people who did the studies  
**[0:07:35-0:07:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  and they weren't even really sure  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:37):**  what type of biochar they were starting with.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  What temperature it was made from,  
**[0:07:41-0:07:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:41):**  what the structure was, those types of things.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:43):**  And she's kind of like.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:44):**  Early on there were a lot of studies like that.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:46):**  I think they're getting better now.  
**[0:07:48-0:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:48):**  And there's some really interesting results  
**[0:07:51-0:07:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:51):**  now coming out of Iowa State.  
**[0:07:56-0:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:56):**  Researchers there are finding that when you add,  
**[0:07:59-0:08:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:59):**  and this is just on soil carbon,  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  when you add biochar to soil over long-term studies,  
**[0:08:06-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:06):**  there were no long-term studies.  
**[0:08:07-0:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:07):**  Now we have more long-term studies.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:09):**  That in six years the soil carbon doubled  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  beyond what the biochar contributed.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:18):**  So it had a stimulating effect to increase soil carbon.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:23):**  So strictly from a climate standpoint,  
**[0:08:25-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:25):**  that's really important.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  But there are things you can do to make biochar work.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  Little tricks of the trade.  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:33):**  And that's what people need to know.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:35):**  And yes, there are a lot of home experimenters out there.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  There are people just like me  
**[0:08:39-0:08:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:39):**  who love to tinker around and play with stuff.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:42):**  And biochar's perfect for that.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  I just got done teaching a three-day day camp  
**[0:08:48-0:08:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:48):**  for middle school kids all about biochar.  
**[0:08:51-0:08:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:51):**  You know, a STEM camp, science, technology,  
**[0:08:55-0:08:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:55):**  engineering, and math.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:56):**  We did a little art project.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:01):**  And it's endless what you can learn.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:04):**  Citizen science about biochar is so fun, easy to do.  
**[0:09:07-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:07):**  Anybody can do it.  
**[0:09:08-0:09:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:08):**  In fact, people have done for millennia  
**[0:09:12-0:09:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:12):**  put charcoal in soils, not just in the Amazon.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:15):**  Also in Africa there are extensive places  
**[0:09:19-0:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  where there are terra preta-like soils.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:21):**  And even in Europe.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:23):**  You know, one of the original researchers  
**[0:09:27-0:09:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:27):**  who looked at terra preta soils  
**[0:09:29-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:29):**  was a Dutch researcher, scientist, Sombraak was his name.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:35):**  And he talked about what he called Plagen soils  
**[0:09:39-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:39):**  in the Netherlands, which were black soils  
**[0:09:43-0:09:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  that were made from refuse.  
**[0:09:46-0:09:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:46):**  You know, people use biomass for heat and power.  
**[0:09:51-0:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:51):**  And often when you have a fire  
**[0:09:53-0:09:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:53):**  you have little chunks of charcoal in it.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:55):**  And so they would use that to sanitize  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:58):**  their other organic waste, whether it's human waste  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:00):**  or food waste or anything like that.  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:04):**  And they'd have refuse areas.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  And those ended up being the fertile soils.  
**[0:10:08-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:08):**  You know, it all happened the same way, I think,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  in a lot of places in the world.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:11):**  And then people realized, some people realized,  
**[0:10:13-0:10:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:13):**  oh, this is what we're doing and we could do it  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:16):**  deliberately and get more of these soils.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:18):**  So these Plagen soils, they called them,  
**[0:10:19-0:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:19):**  in the Netherlands, were the, during World War II  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:24):**  there was food shortages everywhere.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:26):**  And he said his family survived  
**[0:10:29-0:10:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:29):**  because of the Plagen soils on their farm.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:31):**  And if they hadn't had that, they would've starved.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:35):**  So these black soils are everywhere.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  The other thing that convinced me early on  
**[0:10:40-0:10:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  that this is real and we need to look at it  
**[0:10:43-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:43):**  was natural biochar.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  So if you look at the soils in Iowa,  
**[0:10:48-0:10:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:48):**  they're called mollisols, they're similar to the soils  
**[0:10:51-0:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:51):**  in the Ukraine, the richest agricultural soils  
**[0:10:54-0:10:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  in the world.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:56):**  And what makes them that way?  
**[0:10:58-0:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:58):**  What makes them that way is they're step,  
**[0:11:01-0:11:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:01):**  they're step grassland areas.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:03):**  And so they're prairie fires.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:05):**  They come through naturally, you know,  
**[0:11:07-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:07):**  in a cycle of every 10 years or so,  
**[0:11:09-0:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:09):**  or maybe more frequent, I don't know.  
**[0:11:11-0:11:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  And what happens is those tall, tall, tall prairie grasses,  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:15):**  a fire flashes through, burns off the top part  
**[0:11:18-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  of the gases, and the heat goes, radiates down,  
**[0:11:22-0:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  you know, into where the roots all bunch,  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:25):**  you know, the base of those bunch grasses,  
**[0:11:28-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:28):**  and chars that.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  And then the fire moves on, so it goes out  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:33):**  before it turns to ash.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:35):**  So you make a lot of char that way by burning a prairie.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:38):**  And so there's half of the carbon in Iowa soils  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  is charcoal from past prairie fires.  
**[0:11:46-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:46):**  Yeah, the stories are just, they're really interesting.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  And looking at these natural examples,  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:52):**  and then trying to implement those in a human-made system,  
**[0:11:57-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:57):**  I think is where we're at now.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  If you look at starting, working with some scientists  
**[0:12:03-0:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:03):**  at the beginning, knowing that we have longer-term studies  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:05):**  right now, what are kind of some of the bullet points  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:09):**  of where we're at now from the science side of things?  
**[0:12:12-0:12:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  Because a lot of people are always like, you know,  
**[0:12:13-0:12:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:13):**  pound on the table, show me the science, show me the science.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:16):**  So given today, with biochar research,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  where do you think are kind of the unquestionable  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:22):**  or more or less scientific knowns at this point  
**[0:12:26-0:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:26):**  based upon work over the past few decades?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:29):**  Let's see if I can summarize it.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:32):**  Char itself, you know, we wanna know what the mechanisms are.  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:36):**  What makes it do the things that it's claimed to do?  
**[0:12:42-0:12:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:42):**  Keeping in mind that it won't do the same things  
**[0:12:44-0:12:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:44):**  in every situation, but I think the,  
**[0:12:49-0:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:49):**  I always talk about three things  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:51):**  that it provides to microbes.  
**[0:12:54-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  So it provides housing.  
**[0:12:56-0:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  So you've got all this surface area,  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:59):**  and it's got pores at every scale.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:05):**  So it's got macropores because you take wood  
**[0:13:09-0:13:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:09):**  or even straw or something, and you char it,  
**[0:13:12-0:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:12):**  the vascular structure and the cellular structure  
**[0:13:15-0:13:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:15):**  is preserved in that char, and so all the carbon atoms  
**[0:13:20-0:13:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:20):**  link up when you char it and make a very strong,  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:23):**  I mean, it's brittle, but in some ways it's strong  
**[0:13:26-0:13:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:26):**  in that it can't be broken down by microbes easily.  
**[0:13:29-0:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:29):**  And so you have all these little cell walls  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:32):**  and vascular pores and stuff, so it's very porous.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  And then you even have nanoporosity,  
**[0:13:40-0:13:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  and that's just because of the way the carbon atoms,  
**[0:13:42-0:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  the molecules kind of jumble up.  
**[0:13:45-0:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:45):**  If you ever heard of carbon nanotubes,  
**[0:13:47-0:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:47):**  I mean, so there's also a whole nother realm  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:51):**  of applications for biochar that have to do  
**[0:13:54-0:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:54):**  with material science.  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:58):**  So char is being used in electronics,  
**[0:14:05-0:14:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:05):**  as electricity conductor, it's being used  
**[0:14:07-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:07):**  to block infrared radiation and even the microwave radiation  
**[0:14:19-0:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:19):**  because it has these really interesting electrical properties  
**[0:14:23-0:14:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:23):**  so it's two things, porosity with surface area,  
**[0:14:27-0:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:27):**  all those surfaces are electrically active.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:30):**  So that's what gives it cation exchange capacity,  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:34):**  for instance, and also it has this impact on microbes  
**[0:14:40-0:14:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  where it promotes better, more efficient metabolism  
**[0:14:47-0:14:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:47):**  by something that's called diet,  
**[0:14:50-0:14:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  direct interspecies electron transfer.  
**[0:14:54-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:54):**  So it gives them a place to live, so surface area,  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  because microbes like to, they say they like to sit down  
**[0:15:01-0:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:01):**  when they eat, so they can attach to something,  
**[0:15:04-0:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:04):**  and when they're sitting on the surface,  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:06):**  that's got these electrical properties  
**[0:15:08-0:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:08):**  because a carbon, aromatic carbon ring,  
**[0:15:11-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:11):**  now a carbon molecule in char looks like a hexagon,  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  it's a six-sided ring, and that's what they call  
**[0:15:20-0:15:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:20):**  a benzene ring because it's really the basis  
**[0:15:22-0:15:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:22):**  of so much organic chemistry, right?  
**[0:15:25-0:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:25):**  So it's, and the guy who first discovered it  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:29):**  discovered it as part of benzene,  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:32):**  which is one aromatic carbon ring  
**[0:15:35-0:15:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:35):**  with some other stuff on it,  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:36):**  I don't remember the formula for it.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:39):**  And that's an interesting story, his name was Kekulie,  
**[0:15:44-0:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:44):**  this was back in the late 1800s,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:47):**  and he was trying to figure out the structure of this carbon  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:50):**  and he had a dream about the ouroboros,  
**[0:15:54-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  which is the snake that eats its own tail,  
**[0:15:57-0:16:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:57):**  and he woke up the next morning and he said, that's it.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:00):**  What's happening with that ring is that electrons  
**[0:16:03-0:16:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  are free to circulate around it.  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  So that's what gives us the electrical properties.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:08):**  So you have sheets and sheets of this stuff in the biochar.  
**[0:16:12-0:16:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:12):**  Some of you, some people may have heard of graphene,  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:14):**  that's another kind of high-tech nanomaterial,  
**[0:16:16-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:16):**  they're making graphene tubes,  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  and they just have really interesting electrical,  
**[0:16:23-0:16:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  like semiconductor-type properties.  
**[0:16:28-0:16:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:28):**  So yes, so those free electrons are there for microbes,  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:33):**  and microbes can live on the surfaces  
**[0:16:36-0:16:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:36):**  and they can access those electrons  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:40):**  because in their metabolism,  
**[0:16:42-0:16:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  sometimes they need an electron to complete a reaction,  
**[0:16:46-0:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:46):**  a metabolic reaction.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:49):**  And sometimes they need to give one up.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:53):**  And so when they're on this substrate that is conductive  
**[0:16:57-0:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:57):**  and has free electrons,  
**[0:16:59-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:59):**  they can not only improve their metabolic efficiency,  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  but they can also more easily exchange electrons  
**[0:17:06-0:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:06):**  with other microbes.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:08):**  So you get increased diversity.  
**[0:17:11-0:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:11):**  And we all know that biological diversity  
**[0:17:14-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:14):**  is how we get health, right?  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:17):**  Whether it's in our bodies or in the environment.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:20):**  So I would say one of the main things that biochar does  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:24):**  is it promotes microbial life and microbial diversity,  
**[0:17:28-0:17:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:28):**  and you get more stable, more resilient soils from that.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:32):**  And a lot of people listening to this,  
**[0:17:34-0:17:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:34):**  that's what they're after when it comes to char.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:35):**  They're gardeners, they're homesteaders,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:37):**  they're farmers, and the soil either fuels them internally  
**[0:17:42-0:17:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  because it's something that they enjoy,  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:43):**  or it's literally their livelihood.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:46):**  Looking at your work and thinking about projects  
**[0:17:51-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:51):**  that you've done over the years,  
**[0:17:53-0:17:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:53):**  can you talk about some stories or examples  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:56):**  where you've seen agricultural soils really change  
**[0:18:00-0:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:00):**  with the addition of char?  
**[0:18:03-0:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:03):**  So I'm a gardener and an experimenter,  
**[0:18:07-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:07):**  and I'm not a commercial farmer.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:12):**  I've certainly seen my garden soil change a lot,  
**[0:18:14-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:14):**  and I could talk about how, what changes I've observed.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:21):**  There are some people who are starting to use biochar  
**[0:18:24-0:18:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  in broad scale agriculture.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:26):**  There certainly are people who are using it in horticulture,  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:31):**  specifically vineyards, cannabis, nut and fruit trees,  
**[0:18:36-0:18:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:36):**  blueberries, things like that.  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:38):**  I don't have personal experience with those.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:41):**  Well, even on a garden scale would be great,  
**[0:18:43-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  just something you've seen.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:44):**  Well, one of the projects, the biggest project  
**[0:18:47-0:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:47):**  that I have done that involved other people  
**[0:18:49-0:18:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:49):**  was a conservation innovation grant from the NRCS.  
**[0:18:55-0:18:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:55):**  And we got that grant in 2015,  
**[0:18:58-0:19:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:58):**  and we spent three years working with a group of enthusiasts  
**[0:19:04-0:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:04):**  and also a group of small farmers to do biochar experiments.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:08):**  But the whole focus of our grant was not on long-term  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:12):**  field studies, we did some pot trials,  
**[0:19:15-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:15):**  we did do a couple of field trials,  
**[0:19:17-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  which are very difficult to do,  
**[0:19:19-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19):**  but mostly we were looking at how to use biochar  
**[0:19:21-0:19:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  to manage manure.  
**[0:19:24-0:19:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:24):**  So that's the conclusion I came to quite a while ago,  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:27):**  is that when you take charcoal straight out of a kiln,  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:30):**  it's not alive, it's a mineral, you know,  
**[0:19:34-0:19:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:34):**  it's not a biological entity, it's a mineral.  
**[0:19:39-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:39):**  It's a mineral, and it can have some interesting effects  
**[0:19:45-0:19:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:45):**  when you just, if you just add a lot of it right to soil,  
**[0:19:48-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:48):**  straight out of the kiln, it's the sponge  
**[0:19:50-0:19:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:50):**  that starts absorbing things, right?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:53):**  And it can temporarily tie up nitrogen just by absorbing it.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:56):**  It can also temporarily tie up nitrogen if it has,  
**[0:20:00-0:20:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:00):**  you know, there's always two, there's several fractions  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:03):**  in each jar, the way you characterize it is by fractions.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  So you have a fraction of stable carbon,  
**[0:20:09-0:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:09):**  which is, you know, what we think of as the char.  
**[0:20:12-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:12):**  Then you have a fraction of labile carbon,  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  which is, you know, carbon that's not completely charred,  
**[0:20:20-0:20:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:20):**  it might be an oily kind of material,  
**[0:20:23-0:20:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  still has hydrogen and oxygen in it,  
**[0:20:26-0:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:26):**  that's micro food, microbes can eat that.  
**[0:20:28-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:28):**  And then you have ash.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:30):**  So those are the three main fractions,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:32):**  and ash is just some minerals, right?  
**[0:20:34-0:20:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:34):**  When you burn all the carbon out,  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:35):**  you're just left with this white powder,  
**[0:20:37-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:37):**  which is the ash.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  So that labile carbon, some char,  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  have quite a lot of that, and if you put that in soil,  
**[0:20:43-0:20:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:43):**  then it's like adding sawdust.  
**[0:20:46-0:20:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:46):**  You know, so you get the microbial bloom,  
**[0:20:48-0:20:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:48):**  where the microbes go, oh wee, carbon,  
**[0:20:51-0:20:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  now where's the nitrogen?  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:53):**  And so they start robbing all the nitrogen,  
**[0:20:55-0:20:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:55):**  and again, temporarily tying up nitrogen.  
**[0:20:57-0:21:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:57):**  So a lot of people have gotten bad results from char,  
**[0:21:00-0:21:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:00):**  just because they didn't know how to use it.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  They dumped a whole bunch of it right in the soil.  
**[0:21:05-0:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:05):**  Like the first researchers, soil scientists even,  
**[0:21:08-0:21:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:08):**  they looked at the terraprata soils,  
**[0:21:10-0:21:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:10):**  and they said, oh, there's 10 tons per hectare,  
**[0:21:13-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:13):**  10 to 20 tons per hectare of char in these soils.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:16):**  Let's try that.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:17):**  So they dumped 10 to 20 tons per hectare of char in a field,  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  and they get bad results, you know?  
**[0:21:25-0:21:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:25):**  And they're like,  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:26):**  because it created all at once.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:30):**  It was created a little bit at a time,  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:32):**  and it was mixed with other organics.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:34):**  So the secret to using biotories,  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:36):**  put it in the compost first.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:38):**  It's really simple.  
**[0:21:40-0:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:40):**  Anyway, so we did a lot of experiments  
**[0:21:43-0:21:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:43):**  that really showed that, I think,  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:45):**  pretty well with our project.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:47):**  And so we worked with about a dozen small farmers,  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:52):**  and the idea was to, so we're in Oregon,  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:55):**  so these were all farmers mostly who had some woody debris,  
**[0:21:59-0:22:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:59):**  you know, timberland or slash piles.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:01):**  We're always trying to deal with falling branches,  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  dead trees, you know, there are fuels problem for us,  
**[0:22:08-0:22:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  because we have forest fires.  
**[0:22:11-0:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:11):**  So, because they're doing all this work anyway  
**[0:22:13-0:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:13):**  to manage this woody debris,  
**[0:22:16-0:22:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:16):**  and usually putting it in a burn pile that they light off,  
**[0:22:18-0:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:18):**  and it's smoky and not nice.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:23):**  So we designed and built kilns,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  you know, what we call the Oregon kiln,  
**[0:22:27-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:27):**  which is this pyramid kiln,  
**[0:22:28-0:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:28):**  and then another one called the Ring of Fire kiln,  
**[0:22:30-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:30):**  which is just a cylinder.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  And we really, I think, perfected some techniques  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:36):**  for making char in these kilns.  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:39):**  And then we take the char,  
**[0:22:40-0:22:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:40):**  and we'd use it in animal barns.  
**[0:22:46-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:46):**  So we had a goat dairy,  
**[0:22:48-0:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:48):**  and they would sprinkle the char  
**[0:22:50-0:22:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:50):**  on top of the bedding once a week.  
**[0:22:53-0:22:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:53):**  And noticeable improvements in odors, far less ammonia.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:58):**  Animals seem to be healthier.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  They're not exposed to that ammonia.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:03):**  And then the other thing is that the pack,  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:07):**  the manure pack, which in a goat dairy,  
**[0:23:10-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:10):**  you know, they're not cleaning it out every day.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  They're cleaning it maybe two, three times a year.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:15):**  And whereas before they'd have to wear a respirator  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:19):**  when they dug into that,  
**[0:23:20-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  because the ammonia was so intense.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  Now it's compost, it's composting in place.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:25):**  Much healthier for the animals.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  And so that's, you know,  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:30):**  if you have any kind of animals at all,  
**[0:23:32-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:32):**  that's where you should start using your biochar.  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  And then it cascades through the system.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:37):**  I mean, this is a perfect permaculture item,  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:40):**  because it's your stacking functions all the way.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:44):**  Yeah, and you have some great white papers on this  
**[0:23:46-0:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:46):**  at wilsonbiochar.com.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:49):**  And I read that, and I'm like,  
**[0:23:51-0:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:51):**  oh, that's a great idea of putting it into the bedding.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:53):**  And that's something I started doing in my chicken coop.  
**[0:23:55-0:23:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:55):**  I had all this biochar around too.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:57):**  I'm like, what am I gonna do with all this?  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:58):**  I don't really have anywhere else  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:59):**  to put it in the soil right now.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:01):**  So I just started adding it to the chicken coop.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  It does seem, it absorbs.  
**[0:24:06-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:06):**  Chicken manure is very liquid,  
**[0:24:07-0:24:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  so the biochar wants to soak it up.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:10):**  It's less bedding I'm buying.  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:11):**  It does take the smell.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:12):**  And we've also had a problem with a cat box lately.  
**[0:24:15-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:15):**  And now I'm thinking, okay,  
**[0:24:16-0:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:16):**  I'm gonna start adding it to my cat box,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:18):**  is just another way to pick up some of that ammonia smell.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  So I love that aspect of it.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:25):**  When you look at the soils,  
**[0:24:26-0:24:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:26):**  one thing that I find interesting  
**[0:24:28-0:24:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:28):**  is this fractional analysis.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:29):**  And you worked on some of this grading project  
**[0:24:33-0:24:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:33):**  for how biochar was classified.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:36):**  In a perfect world, like if I was gonna create a lab  
**[0:24:38-0:24:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  and a machine to make the best biochar for soil amendments,  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  do you want the majority of that char to be stable carbon  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  with the least amount of labial carbon  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:51):**  and least amount of ash possible?  
**[0:24:52-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:52):**  Well, it does depend on your objective.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  But yes, I've come to the conclusion  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:03):**  that the high temperature chars are definitely easier to use.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  So, okay, there's a difference between,  
**[0:25:11-0:25:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:11):**  this is really easy, I think, for people to understand,  
**[0:25:13-0:25:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:13):**  the difference between the biochar  
**[0:25:15-0:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:15):**  that we make at high temperature in a flame,  
**[0:25:18-0:25:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  the flame cap kilns.  
**[0:25:20-0:25:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:20):**  There are other processes too,  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  like gasifiers or even most of the char  
**[0:25:26-0:25:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:26):**  that's made commercially these days  
**[0:25:27-0:25:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:27):**  is made in biomass power plants in a furnace.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:32):**  So it's actually made,  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:34):**  there's a lot of misconceptions about what pyrolysis is.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:37):**  Pyrolysis being the process for making char.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:41):**  So you can make char in a retort  
**[0:25:43-0:25:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:43):**  that's an enclosed vessel that's externally heated.  
**[0:25:47-0:25:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:47):**  You have a little more control over that sometimes.  
**[0:25:51-0:25:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:51):**  Or you can make it in a flame  
**[0:25:53-0:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:53):**  and you just adjust the process  
**[0:25:56-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:56):**  so that you save the char.  
**[0:25:59-0:26:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:59):**  So use the flame to get the gas out of it and burn the gas.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:04):**  And then once you've finished that first stage,  
**[0:26:08-0:26:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:08):**  then you remove the char essentially from the air.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  So those are two processes.  
**[0:26:14-0:26:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:14):**  And I've got webinars on my website  
**[0:26:17-0:26:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:17):**  that people can look at if they want all the details,  
**[0:26:19-0:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:19):**  technical details about how those work.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:22):**  But the flame process is always a high temperature process.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:25):**  It's always gonna be about 1000 degrees centigrade.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  Whereas a retort process can be much lower temperature  
**[0:26:33-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  because it's basically an oven  
**[0:26:34-0:26:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:34):**  and you can turn it up any temperature you want.  
**[0:26:37-0:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:37):**  You're applying the heat externally.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:39):**  And that's how barbecue charcoal is made or fuel charcoal.  
**[0:26:43-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:43):**  So it's made, well it's actually a little bit  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  of a hybrid process that I won't go into.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  But it's made at low temperature and by cutting off air.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:55):**  And so there's a lot of tar and oil in that stuff.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  And that is great for fuel.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:03):**  Because it gives you more energy  
**[0:27:04-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:04):**  to burn to cook your steak or whatever.  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:07):**  But it can be good for soil.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:11):**  It does have that problem of the microbial bloom  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:14):**  because it's a labile carbon.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:16):**  And it can also have some kind of toxic stuff  
**[0:27:20-0:27:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  that can suppress plant growth.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:22):**  It can also have some really interesting chemicals though.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  So for instance, one of the byproducts  
**[0:27:28-0:27:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  of some charcoal making processes  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:30):**  is something called wood vinegar.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  So that's a condensate.  
**[0:27:34-0:27:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:34):**  So you take the smoke basically,  
**[0:27:36-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:36):**  the wet smoke from the first part of the burn  
**[0:27:39-0:27:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  where you're still taking water off.  
**[0:27:42-0:27:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:42):**  And you condense that and you get this aqueous liquid.  
**[0:27:46-0:27:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:46):**  So you get these water soluble chemicals.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:49):**  It's about five percent acetic acid.  
**[0:27:53-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:53):**  So it's like pH about 1.5 I think or two.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  And it's got all these chemicals  
**[0:28:02-0:28:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:02):**  that are growth stimulants.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:04):**  So think about what happens after a fire,  
**[0:28:09-0:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:09):**  the forest fire.  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:11):**  You see that new growth coming back really quickly.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:14):**  Part of that is because of those smoke chemicals.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:18):**  Their growth stimulants.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:21):**  So some people are actually capturing that  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:23):**  and selling that for an agricultural amendment.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:28):**  And it promotes microbes eating.  
**[0:28:32-0:28:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:32):**  I think the chemical that promotes growth  
**[0:28:34-0:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:34):**  is called caricane.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:37):**  And then it can also,  
**[0:28:39-0:28:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  if you dilute it at different strengths,  
**[0:28:41-0:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  it can be used as a pesticide.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:44):**  It's good for powdery mildew  
**[0:28:46-0:28:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  and other kinds of fungicide.  
**[0:28:51-0:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:51):**  So they can have some benefits,  
**[0:28:54-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:54):**  low temperature charcoal can have some benefits.  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  So you just need to understand it  
**[0:28:58-0:29:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:58):**  and what it does and how to use it  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:01):**  and what you want to accomplish with your char.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  So a high temperature char is essentially a more pure char.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  It's a higher carbon percentage.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:12):**  Yeah, a high temperature char is usually  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  at least 75% up to 85 or even 90% pure carbon.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:21):**  And a lower temperature char might be 50% carbon.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:26):**  And yeah.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:29):**  Well, one of the concerns that I have had come up  
**[0:29:31-0:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:31):**  when people have heard me talk about it is they're like,  
**[0:29:35-0:29:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:35):**  what about the process?  
**[0:29:36-0:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:36):**  Can it produce toxic compounds, dioxins, things like that?  
**[0:29:39-0:29:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:39):**  If you are burning at these higher temperatures,  
**[0:29:42-0:29:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:42):**  what are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:29:44-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:44):**  Are you gonna end up with toxic compounds  
**[0:29:47-0:29:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:47):**  potentially in the char?  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:50):**  No, not really.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:53):**  There's a few circumstances where it can happen.  
**[0:29:55-0:30:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  One thing that probably needs to be looked at is  
**[0:30:00-0:30:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:00):**  if the wood has a lot of salt in it,  
**[0:30:02-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:02):**  like if it was beechwood now from the beach  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  or if it had been near the ocean and I had salt spray.  
**[0:30:12-0:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:12):**  Chlorine is a known precursor of dioxins,  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:15):**  so you'd want to look at that.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  But the high temperature processes generally,  
**[0:30:26-0:30:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:26):**  dioxins may be created,  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:27):**  but they're usually destroyed immediately.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:30):**  So it's really complicated.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:33):**  There's different pathways that can form dioxins.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:38):**  Right now, I did a paper on it.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:41):**  It's on the IDI website on dioxin formation.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:45):**  And it's just, you know,  
**[0:30:48-0:30:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  it's not very likely that you're gonna find any dioxins  
**[0:30:53-0:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:53):**  especially in the low tech kind of processes.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:56):**  Some higher tech processes may be, but no.  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  There is something called a PAH,  
**[0:31:03-0:31:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:03):**  a polyaromatic hydrocarbon.  
**[0:31:06-0:31:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:06):**  And there is a whole class of chemicals.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  And you'll find some of those in some biochars.  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:13):**  But they are, first of all, most of them are harmless.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:19):**  In fact, you know, biotarch itself is a PAH,  
**[0:31:22-0:31:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:22):**  a polyaromatic hydrocarbon.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:25):**  So it's just, there's like 18 of them  
**[0:31:28-0:31:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:28):**  that are short chain molecules that can be toxic.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:34):**  And I think some of the lower temperature charts  
**[0:31:38-0:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:38):**  are more likely to have them than the high temperature charts  
**[0:31:41-0:31:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:41):**  that we have.  
**[0:31:42-0:31:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:42):**  So, you know, the biotarch that we make in kilns,  
**[0:31:46-0:31:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:46):**  in open flame, you know, the flame gap kilns is very safe.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:52):**  In terms of controlling temperature of the burn,  
**[0:31:55-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:55):**  are the main factors in that moisture content in the wood  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  when you start, the amount of available oxygen  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  to get at the flame at the top,  
**[0:32:05-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  and then how you're layering the pile  
**[0:32:07-0:32:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  along with like maybe size of material?  
**[0:32:09-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:09):**  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  You know, you don't want smoldering combustion.  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  Smoldering combustion is cool.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  You wanna keep a good hot flame there,  
**[0:32:18-0:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:18):**  it burns the smoke so you're not polluting the air as much.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:22):**  And it keeps the temperature high.  
**[0:32:26-0:32:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:26):**  If you don't have a flame, then you're cooling down.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:30):**  Sure.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:31):**  What about in terms of feedstock?  
**[0:32:34-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:34):**  Let's say we burned and made biochar out of rice hulls,  
**[0:32:38-0:32:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  softwood like a pine,  
**[0:32:40-0:32:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:40):**  and then something that burns really hot and hard  
**[0:32:42-0:32:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:42):**  like black locust.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:44):**  We're gonna end up with char at the end of all those,  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:48):**  assuming we manage the fire appropriately.  
**[0:32:51-0:32:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:51):**  What do you think is gonna be the difference  
**[0:32:53-0:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:53):**  between those chars?  
**[0:32:57-0:33:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:57):**  Well, the wood chars mainly differ by density.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:02):**  So, you know, your black locust  
**[0:33:05-0:33:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:05):**  is probably more dense than your pine.  
**[0:33:06-0:33:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:06):**  So it'll be different by density.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:11):**  That's the main thing.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:13):**  Because if you cook it hot,  
**[0:33:15-0:33:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:15):**  you know, all the other distinguishing chemistry  
**[0:33:19-0:33:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:19):**  of the wood species is gonna be cooked away,  
**[0:33:22-0:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:22):**  burned away in the flame.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:24):**  So, I mean, your goal is to get the carbon.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:28):**  The ash content will be different.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:30):**  You know, you'll have, because different species  
**[0:33:32-0:33:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  will have different kind of metals in them  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  that they take up,  
**[0:33:36-0:33:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:36):**  which can also vary by where it's grown.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:39):**  So that's another thing.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:40):**  If you're doing like phytoremediation on an old mine site,  
**[0:33:45-0:33:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  trying to take up, I don't know, mercury or zinc  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:49):**  or something, I don't know,  
**[0:33:51-0:33:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:51):**  and then you burn that,  
**[0:33:53-0:33:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:53):**  you might end up with toxic levels of heavy metals  
**[0:33:57-0:33:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:57):**  in your char.  
**[0:33:59-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:59):**  So, you know, that's another consideration.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  Then rice hulls, crop waste is usually straws  
**[0:34:05-0:34:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:05):**  and hulls and things like that are usually quite different.  
**[0:34:08-0:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:08):**  They'll have much higher ash content.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:11):**  Rice hulls are particularly interesting  
**[0:34:13-0:34:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:13):**  because they have a lot of silica.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:17):**  And if you char those at high temperature,  
**[0:34:19-0:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:19):**  you can actually get some little,  
**[0:34:23-0:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:23):**  they call them cristobalites, little crystals of silica  
**[0:34:27-0:34:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  that are like glass.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  And those can be dangerous to breathe.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  So like, almost like asbestos.  
**[0:34:35-0:34:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:35):**  So rice hulls you need to be careful with.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37):**  But on the other hand, they're very easy to char  
**[0:34:40-0:34:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:40):**  because each rice hull is surrounded  
**[0:34:43-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:43):**  by this little silica envelope.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  So it's like a mini retort.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:47):**  So, you know, the carbon inside chars really easily  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  because it's protected from the air by the silica shell.  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:57):**  And they're, carbonized rice hulls are used a lot in Asia.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:00):**  Do you think that, you know, you work with what you have,  
**[0:35:05-0:35:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:05):**  that's always kind of the best choice.  
**[0:35:06-0:35:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:06):**  You're in forest country, there's a lot of brush  
**[0:35:09-0:35:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  and wood around you to burn.  
**[0:35:12-0:35:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:12):**  For somebody who has a lot of ag waste,  
**[0:35:15-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:15):**  do you think that they're, in terms of the soil,  
**[0:35:18-0:35:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:18):**  do you think they're equal one for one?  
**[0:35:21-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:21):**  Like if you had your pick and really sourcing  
**[0:35:24-0:35:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  wasn't a factor and they were two piles in front of you,  
**[0:35:28-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:28):**  a pile of rice hull biochar, a pile of biochar  
**[0:35:31-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  from made from woody debris,  
**[0:35:33-0:35:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  is there one you would lean towards  
**[0:35:35-0:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:35):**  just given your experience?  
**[0:35:38-0:35:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  Well, what are you growing?  
**[0:35:39-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:39):**  Let's say we're just growing vegetables.  
**[0:35:44-0:35:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:44):**  You know, I just don't have any experience with crop waste.  
**[0:35:46-0:35:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:46):**  So I can't give you any direct experience.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:49):**  I do know a lot of researchers feel like straw  
**[0:35:53-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:53):**  and right and, you know, crop waste chars are better.  
**[0:35:56-0:36:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:56):**  Will give you more of a fertilizer effect, in other words,  
**[0:36:00-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:00):**  because you do have more ash.  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  Ash and those minerals are nutrients.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:05):**  If you are, so first I'm trying to, you know,  
**[0:36:09-0:36:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  mention this to a few of the cannabis growers  
**[0:36:11-0:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:11):**  that I know around here,  
**[0:36:12-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  because we're a hot spot for that,  
**[0:36:14-0:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:14):**  that, you know, they're spending all this money on inputs  
**[0:36:18-0:36:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:18):**  and then at the end of the season  
**[0:36:19-0:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:19):**  they have all these hemp stalks  
**[0:36:22-0:36:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:22):**  and a lot of them just burn them, get rid of them,  
**[0:36:26-0:36:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:26):**  take them away, they don't know what they're doing.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  And I'm like, you know, you should at least compost them  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:32):**  and if you make them into char,  
**[0:36:36-0:36:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:36):**  you know, that plant took up all those inputs you paid for  
**[0:36:42-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:42):**  and at least the mineral ones are still gonna be there.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:45):**  So, you know, you can recycle back into the soil.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:49):**  So, you know, if you're growing a monocrop every year,  
**[0:36:54-0:36:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  why not, you know, conserve your,  
**[0:36:58-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:58):**  their minerals that can be conserved in the char  
**[0:37:01-0:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:01):**  rather than buying them again.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:03):**  Yeah, and thinking of ash content,  
**[0:37:06-0:37:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:06):**  so when you make the char,  
**[0:37:09-0:37:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:09):**  you can somewhat, I think, control how much ash  
**[0:37:11-0:37:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:11):**  is left on there or by how much you rinse it  
**[0:37:15-0:37:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:15):**  in the quench process.  
**[0:37:16-0:37:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:16):**  Can you talk a little bit about the importance  
**[0:37:18-0:37:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  of quenching biochar and its effect on the pores in the char  
**[0:37:23-0:37:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:23):**  and the rinsing of ash off of the char?  
**[0:37:29-0:37:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:29):**  Well, again, it really depends on your purpose  
**[0:37:32-0:37:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:32):**  and where you are, what your soils need.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:35):**  Here in a forested region on the Pacific coast,  
**[0:37:41-0:37:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:41):**  our soils tend to be acidic  
**[0:37:43-0:37:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:43):**  because we get a lot of rain, right,  
**[0:37:45-0:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  which makes for more acid soils.  
**[0:37:47-0:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:47):**  So ash is not a problem, you know.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:50):**  I don't worry about it, trying to rinse it at all,  
**[0:37:55-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  especially since I'm putting it in the compost first.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:58):**  However, where you have alkaline soils,  
**[0:38:01-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:01):**  you need to be very careful  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  because it has a whining impact, right?  
**[0:38:06-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:06):**  And if your soil's already pH eight  
**[0:38:09-0:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  and you had a pH nine biochar with ash in it,  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:15):**  you're not gonna be happy with the results.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:17):**  So that's, again, another reason to compost it first  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:22):**  because the pH will neutralize after composting.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  Because microbes live in there,  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:30):**  they deposit organic acids,  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:32):**  the organic acids also now create anion exchange capacity.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:38):**  Char is like a seed for humus  
**[0:38:41-0:38:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:41):**  and that's how you should use it,  
**[0:38:43-0:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:43):**  is to grow humus and then put it in the soil.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:47):**  That's what I think.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:50):**  So rinsing, not rinsing, you know,  
**[0:38:53-0:38:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:53):**  if you are in a, you know,  
**[0:38:58-0:39:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  in eastern Oregon or in the desert,  
**[0:39:00-0:39:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:00):**  you know, where soils are alkaline,  
**[0:39:02-0:39:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:02):**  yes, you probably wanna try and rinse it if you can first.  
**[0:39:07-0:39:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:07):**  And then put it in your compost  
**[0:39:08-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  because your compost might be a bit alkaline too.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  You can use other organics, you know,  
**[0:39:18-0:39:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:18):**  to bring the pH down.  
**[0:39:23-0:39:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  Well, knowing that and knowing that  
**[0:39:25-0:39:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:25):**  there's a lot of different methods  
**[0:39:27-0:39:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:27):**  that people could be making biochar,  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:29):**  including people getting it from biomass plants,  
**[0:39:33-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:33):**  there's a lot of companies selling biochar now.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  And it's one of those things,  
**[0:39:39-0:39:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:39):**  people hear biochar, they see it on the bag,  
**[0:39:40-0:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:40):**  they buy it and I'm thinking,  
**[0:39:42-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:42):**  well, they're not all created equal.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  If you're purchasing biochar from company X,  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:50):**  are there questions you think you should be asking  
**[0:39:52-0:39:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  or things you should be looking for  
**[0:39:55-0:39:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:55):**  when you buy them to ensure that you're getting something  
**[0:39:58-0:40:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:58):**  that's maybe a higher quality or better?  
**[0:40:03-0:40:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:03):**  Yeah, you should ask for that fractional analysis.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:06):**  What's the percentage of stable carbon?  
**[0:40:08-0:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:08):**  What's the percentage of degradable carbon or labile carbon?  
**[0:40:12-0:40:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:12):**  What's the percentage of ash?  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:14):**  What is the feedstock?  
**[0:40:16-0:40:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  Is it made from wood?  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:19):**  And ask about the process.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:21):**  Ask about the temperature that it's made at.  
**[0:40:24-0:40:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:24):**  Although, you know, if you know the fractional analysis,  
**[0:40:26-0:40:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:26):**  you have a pretty good idea of that.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:28):**  So you wanna know what it's made from  
**[0:40:30-0:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:30):**  and what's the fractional analysis.  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  And those are the main things you need to know.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:35):**  If you can get information on surface area,  
**[0:40:39-0:40:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:39):**  that's good too.  
**[0:40:41-0:40:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:41):**  So, you know, the other thing is that biochar is,  
**[0:40:45-0:40:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:45):**  or charcoal, charred organic matter is a continuum of stuff.  
**[0:40:49-0:40:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:49):**  You know, I've already talked about the fuel charcoal  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:52):**  at low temperature and then, you know,  
**[0:40:54-0:40:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:54):**  we got the high temperature chars that are more porous  
**[0:40:58-0:41:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:58):**  and more pure carbon.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  Then over here, you now get into these engineered materials  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  like activated carbons.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:05):**  So activated carbons are used in filtration.  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:09):**  And there's a whole activated carbon industry.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:12):**  And there's all kinds of properties.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:15):**  These things can be tuned to absorb  
**[0:41:18-0:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  specific chemicals or metals.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:22):**  And that's a very active area of biochar research actually  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:26):**  is because those markets actually exist.  
**[0:41:31-0:41:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:31):**  You know, they've been around for a while.  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:34):**  They're very robust markets.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:36):**  There's a lot of it sold, you know,  
**[0:41:38-0:41:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:38):**  whether it's for filtering water in your aquarium  
**[0:41:41-0:41:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:41):**  or fish tank or whether it's, you know,  
**[0:41:43-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  a water treatment plant is filtering drinking water  
**[0:41:46-0:41:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:46):**  for a city.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  Activated carbons are a big market.  
**[0:41:50-0:41:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:50):**  And some of these biochars, they're finding  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:53):**  are work really almost as well,  
**[0:41:56-0:41:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:56):**  sometimes better than some of the engineered carbons  
**[0:41:59-0:42:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:59):**  which are usually made from coal.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:02):**  So that's a whole nother area of biochar research.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  And it's kind of further on that spectrum.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:11):**  Yeah, for people that are interested  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:14):**  in adding biochars to their soil,  
**[0:42:15-0:42:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:15):**  I think one of the best ways to do it  
**[0:42:17-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:17):**  is to get out there and make it from a simple pit kiln  
**[0:42:21-0:42:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  that you can just dig in the soil  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:22):**  to some of the more, I'll call them advanced,  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:25):**  although they're not super complex.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:28):**  This is not like building a computer  
**[0:42:30-0:42:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:30):**  of the like the fire cap kiln.  
**[0:42:32-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:32):**  You have cone kilns, pyramid kilns, that Oregon kiln.  
**[0:42:36-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:36):**  You have plans for all that on wilsonbiochar.com.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  What do you think is a great way for a beginner  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:42):**  to start out if they wanna make some biochar?  
**[0:42:45-0:42:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:45):**  They maybe don't have great fabrication skills.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:48):**  They don't wanna dump a bunch of money in it right away  
**[0:42:50-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:50):**  cause they're not sure if they're gonna be into this.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  How would you advise people start?  
**[0:42:54-0:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:54):**  You know, the easiest, quickest way  
**[0:42:58-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:58):**  to make a lot of biochar is to have some small brush.  
**[0:43:01-0:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:01):**  So, you know, whatever's growing around  
**[0:43:05-0:43:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:05):**  that's a problem for you that's just small brush  
**[0:43:08-0:43:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:08):**  that most of those stems are about the size,  
**[0:43:10-0:43:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  no thicker than your pinky.  
**[0:43:12-0:43:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:12):**  You know, maybe basically finger size stuff and smaller.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:16):**  And you could take, if you had some old roofing steel,  
**[0:43:20-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:20):**  just lay it out on the ground and make a surface,  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:25):**  a metal surface, pile your brush on that  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:29):**  and kinda compress it.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  Can't be too loose.  
**[0:43:32-0:43:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:32):**  So compress it down as much as you can.  
**[0:43:35-0:43:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  Light it on top.  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:37):**  Let it burn down until it's that glowing coal stage  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:41):**  and it's just starting to ash.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:43):**  And then put it out with water.  
**[0:43:46-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:46):**  It goes quick cause it's small.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  And when you put it on that metal plaque,  
**[0:43:53-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:53):**  you know, underneath it, that reflects the heat back.  
**[0:43:56-0:43:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  So it's much more efficient.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:59):**  And then it goes out easily and then it's sitting  
**[0:44:02-0:44:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:02):**  on these metal sheets and you can scoop it up easily.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:05):**  It's already a pretty small particle size  
**[0:44:07-0:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:07):**  so you don't really have to do much to crush it up,  
**[0:44:10-0:44:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:10):**  although you can crush it further if you want.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:15):**  That's the easiest way I found to make a lot  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:17):**  of barter quickly with very little trouble.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:20):**  And if you don't have metal sheets,  
**[0:44:21-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:21):**  just do it on the ground, you know.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  But basically just a top lit burn pile.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:26):**  If you want to do a shallow pit,  
**[0:44:29-0:44:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:29):**  it doesn't need to be a big pit.  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:31):**  Just even a little shallow pit will help.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:37):**  But the key thing is the feedstock, small brush.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:42):**  Another way you could do it if you don't have much,  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:44):**  you just wanna play around with it,  
**[0:44:45-0:44:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:45):**  and maybe you don't have the ability to burn a pile  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:50):**  because you're in town or in the suburbs.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  You've got a kettle grill.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:57):**  You have a kettle grill in your backyard on your deck?  
**[0:45:00-0:45:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:00):**  You can make biochar.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:02):**  So you just cut off the, you know,  
**[0:45:04-0:45:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:04):**  this would be for a charcoal grill, not a gas grill.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:07):**  But you close the air holes in the bottom,  
**[0:45:11-0:45:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  you get some little wood chunks, little sticks,  
**[0:45:14-0:45:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:14):**  make a little kind of open rick, light it on top,  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:20):**  let it burn down if you want.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  You've got time to quickly cook a hot dog  
**[0:45:26-0:45:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:26):**  or a shish kebab or something  
**[0:45:28-0:45:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:28):**  while it's in the charcoal stage.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:30):**  And then you can either put it out with water  
**[0:45:32-0:45:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:32):**  or you can dump it in a metal can with a lid  
**[0:45:35-0:45:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:35):**  and snuff it that way.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:36):**  So you can make small amounts of biochar like that.  
**[0:45:39-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:39):**  You can make it every time you cook.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:42):**  You know, you don't have to buy charcoal.  
**[0:45:43-0:45:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:43):**  You can just make it and use it  
**[0:45:47-0:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:47):**  and then save some of it for the soil.  
**[0:45:52-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:52):**  Burning from the top versus burning from the bottom.  
**[0:45:54-0:45:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  Most of these vessels, you know,  
**[0:45:56-0:45:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:56):**  there's some sort of shape.  
**[0:45:57-0:45:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  And in a traditional fire,  
**[0:45:59-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:59):**  if you're gonna start a campfire,  
**[0:46:00-0:46:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:00):**  you know, you're building your fire down here  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:02):**  and then you're adding wood  
**[0:46:03-0:46:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  and it's potentially building up here.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06):**  You look at some of the diagrams on sites like yours,  
**[0:46:09-0:46:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:09):**  you have this vessel, it's empty.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:11):**  We're gonna fill it with dry brush.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:12):**  We're gonna light it up here.  
**[0:46:13-0:46:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:13):**  It's gonna burn its way down,  
**[0:46:15-0:46:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:15):**  creates an ash and a flame cap at the top.  
**[0:46:18-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:18):**  Then we're gonna start adding our new material to that  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  once that's all burned.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:22):**  What's the significance of burning from the top?  
**[0:46:25-0:46:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:25):**  Why that and why not start at the bottom,  
**[0:46:28-0:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  get a fire going and layer up?  
**[0:46:32-0:46:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:32):**  This is quicker.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  I mean, you,  
**[0:46:37-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:37):**  and I've used to do it that way  
**[0:46:39-0:46:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:39):**  where I put a small fire in the kiln.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:40):**  It would just take a long time to build up the heat.  
**[0:46:43-0:46:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:43):**  Take the whole extra hour.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:45):**  So by making them a kind of loose rick,  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:48):**  and if you make it too big,  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  you won't be able, it won't burn all the way down.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:52):**  So, you know, lots of times I've ended up  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  with some unburned stuff in the bottom.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  But that's not a problem.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:00):**  But still, you know, if you kind of fill it fairly full  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:05):**  with smaller stuff, it will, you know,  
**[0:47:10-0:47:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:10):**  it starts doing that thing where it sucks air from the top.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:15):**  Where in making biochar,  
**[0:47:18-0:47:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:18):**  where do you think people make mistakes?  
**[0:47:21-0:47:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:21):**  Where are they getting it wrong?  
**[0:47:22-0:47:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:22):**  You teach a lot of workshops.  
**[0:47:23-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:23):**  You've seen a lot of this.  
**[0:47:25-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  Are there common things people do wrong  
**[0:47:28-0:47:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  on the production side?  
**[0:47:29-0:47:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:29):**  So not inoculating it, not composting it first,  
**[0:47:33-0:47:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:33):**  but on the production side.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  Well, I think we're all learning, you know,  
**[0:47:37-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:37):**  and everybody has different feedstocks.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  I think the main thing that's gonna give you better results  
**[0:47:43-0:47:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:43):**  is to make sure your biomass is dry and not too big.  
**[0:47:48-0:47:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:48):**  So, you know, I see people trying to push a big log  
**[0:47:52-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:52):**  into a kiln, and it's, you know,  
**[0:47:56-0:48:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:56):**  it doesn't sustain, a big wet log won't sustain the flame.  
**[0:48:00-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:00):**  If it burns at all, it'll smolder.  
**[0:48:03-0:48:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  From a fuel standpoint, you know,  
**[0:48:05-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:05):**  fuel reduction standpoint, you know,  
**[0:48:07-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  where we're just trying, we're out in the forest  
**[0:48:09-0:48:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  and we've got, you know, yard, you know,  
**[0:48:13-0:48:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:13):**  just piles and piles of brush  
**[0:48:14-0:48:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:14):**  that we just have to treat and deal with.  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:18):**  People will put big logs in those piles  
**[0:48:20-0:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:20):**  and there's no need from a fuel standpoint  
**[0:48:23-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:23):**  to try to burn, you know, an eight inch diameter log  
**[0:48:28-0:48:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  because it's not a fuel danger.  
**[0:48:30-0:48:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:30):**  It's the small brush, it's the limbs.  
**[0:48:32-0:48:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:32):**  Those are the things we wanna burn.  
**[0:48:34-0:48:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:34):**  So keep it small and keep it dry  
**[0:48:36-0:48:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:36):**  and you should be successful.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:39):**  And always keep a flame on top  
**[0:48:40-0:48:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  because if you start loading it too fast,  
**[0:48:43-0:48:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:43):**  the flame will die down, it'll start getting smoke.  
**[0:48:46-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:46):**  So as soon as you get smoke, hold off, you know,  
**[0:48:50-0:48:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  let the flame come back up.  
**[0:48:51-0:48:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:51):**  So in a perfect burn, I mean,  
**[0:48:52-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:52):**  this is one concern people have  
**[0:48:54-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  that aren't knowledgeable about it.  
**[0:48:54-0:48:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  They're like, you're putting all that smoke  
**[0:48:56-0:48:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:56):**  and particulate it into the air,  
**[0:48:58-0:49:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:58):**  but in a efficient, clean burn,  
**[0:49:00-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:00):**  there is no to minimal smoke  
**[0:49:03-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:03):**  and there was no particulate  
**[0:49:04-0:49:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  as it's all being burned off.  
**[0:49:08-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:08):**  Well, I mean, there's some, but yeah.  
**[0:49:12-0:49:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:12):**  You're not gonna see it from miles away.  
**[0:49:13-0:49:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:13):**  You just broke.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:15):**  I think we're having a little glitch here.  
**[0:49:19-0:49:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:19):**  So now it's happening.  
**[0:49:22-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:22):**  Can you hear me now?  
**[0:49:25-0:49:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:25):**  Hello?  
**[0:49:26-0:49:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:26):**  Yes.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:27):**  Okay, yeah.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  I'm not sure what that was, a Skype thing.  
**[0:49:30-0:49:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:30):**  I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna take him,  
**[0:49:31-0:49:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:31):**  and I'm just gonna go close the door here.  
**[0:49:33-0:49:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:33):**  Sure.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:41):**  And I know you have about 10 minutes,  
**[0:49:42-0:49:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:42):**  so I'm winding it down here.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  Okay, so yes, in a perfect burn,  
**[0:49:50-0:49:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  you would always keep a strong flame on top.  
**[0:49:52-0:49:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:52):**  You would have a windscreen,  
**[0:49:54-0:49:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:54):**  which I have found makes a big difference.  
**[0:49:57-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:57):**  I have a new kiln design.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  I'm calling the deluxe Ring of Fire.  
**[0:50:01-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:01):**  We just started producing those this spring,  
**[0:50:05-0:50:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  and we tested them out with,  
**[0:50:08-0:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  we had a bunch of high school kids  
**[0:50:10-0:50:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:10):**  who were home from school with nothing to do.  
**[0:50:14-0:50:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:14):**  So we went around in our neighborhood,  
**[0:50:16-0:50:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:16):**  and we just charred all the neighbors' burnt piles.  
**[0:50:20-0:50:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:20):**  And so it was a great service for them,  
**[0:50:24-0:50:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:24):**  and this new kiln, it's got an extra screen around it.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:28):**  So it's a Ring of Fire with an extra windscreen,  
**[0:50:32-0:50:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  and it really dramatically improves the efficiency  
**[0:50:34-0:50:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:34):**  and the emissions, at least visually,  
**[0:50:38-0:50:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:38):**  because you got a preheated air coming up  
**[0:50:41-0:50:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:41):**  in the annular space between the two rings,  
**[0:50:44-0:50:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:44):**  and that preheated air helps feed the flame.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:51):**  And it's a little taller as opposed to the Oregon kiln.  
**[0:50:55-0:50:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:55):**  And so the fire kind of stays down in the hole.  
**[0:50:59-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:59):**  And so the smoke really burns a lot better,  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  and I'm really liking the way this kiln is working.  
**[0:51:09-0:51:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:09):**  That's cool.  
**[0:51:10-0:51:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:10):**  People can see pics of that on the website.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:12):**  Let's say now we're done burning.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:15):**  What are your thoughts on reducing particle size at the end?  
**[0:51:19-0:51:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:19):**  You're gonna have chunky stuff.  
**[0:51:21-0:51:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:21):**  You're gonna have finer stuff.  
**[0:51:22-0:51:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:22):**  Do you think it's important?  
**[0:51:24-0:51:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:24):**  People obsess on this, it needs to be powderish,  
**[0:51:27-0:51:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:27):**  it needs to look like rice,  
**[0:51:28-0:51:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:28):**  it can't look like bigger things like dog food.  
**[0:51:32-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:32):**  What are your thoughts on particle size?  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  Well, you know, finer biochar has more immediate impact  
**[0:51:42-0:51:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:42):**  because if you're a microbe,  
**[0:51:45-0:51:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:45):**  even a tiny little powder piece of char is really big.  
**[0:51:50-0:51:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:50):**  Right, so it gives the microbes more access.  
**[0:51:55-0:51:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:55):**  But char can do different things.  
**[0:51:58-0:52:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:58):**  It's not just home for microbes,  
**[0:52:00-0:52:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:00):**  it also holds water and air,  
**[0:52:02-0:52:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:02):**  and it can help loosen soil, give it better tills.  
**[0:52:11-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:11):**  I like to put chunks of biochar in the bottom of pots,  
**[0:52:16-0:52:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:16):**  potted plants for drainage.  
**[0:52:19-0:52:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:19):**  And actually to hold water and allow water to drain  
**[0:52:24-0:52:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:24):**  kind of does both things,  
**[0:52:25-0:52:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:25):**  but keeping the right water, a moisture level, and air  
**[0:52:29-0:52:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:29):**  so that your pots don't get anaerobic.  
**[0:52:34-0:52:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:34):**  So, you know, in my garden I have some chunks  
**[0:52:38-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:38):**  and I have some vines,  
**[0:52:39-0:52:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:39):**  a variety of particle sizes, perfectly good.  
**[0:52:43-0:52:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:43):**  Yeah, so knowing that, the other thing is dosage  
**[0:52:49-0:52:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49):**  or rate of application.  
**[0:52:51-0:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:51):**  Do you think that there's an amount people should look at  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:55):**  to start with if, you know, not go overboard,  
**[0:52:59-0:53:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:59):**  that whatever 10 tons per hectare,  
**[0:53:02-0:53:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:02):**  but you also want enough to potentially see  
**[0:53:04-0:53:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:04):**  some sort of result.  
**[0:53:06-0:53:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:06):**  Where do you think that middle ground is to say,  
**[0:53:09-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:09):**  I'm serious enough to give this a shot,  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:11):**  I'm gonna do enough to put it there to make an impact,  
**[0:53:15-0:53:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:15):**  but we're not going overboard.  
**[0:53:19-0:53:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:19):**  It depends so much on your soil, okay, it really does.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:23):**  But when I'm doing veggie starch or making a potting soil mix  
**[0:53:29-0:53:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:29):**  I'm depending on how much other stuff is in the soil mix,  
**[0:53:34-0:53:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:34):**  like how much other fertilizer,  
**[0:53:36-0:53:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:36):**  I might put 20% char, that would be a lot,  
**[0:53:43-0:53:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:43):**  get results with less.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:46):**  The critical thing is compost.  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:49):**  It's really interesting that you could see a big difference,  
**[0:53:53-0:53:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:53):**  and I've done a lot of compost experiments  
**[0:53:56-0:53:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:56):**  between five and 10% char.  
**[0:53:59-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:59):**  You know, whereas five percent might make a compost pile  
**[0:54:04-0:54:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  really heat up, 10% might cool it down a little bit.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:08):**  In the end you still get great compost,  
**[0:54:10-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:10):**  but you can really see, it's like an air fuel mixture  
**[0:54:15-0:54:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  in a carburetor, you know, you can get the mixture  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:19):**  rich or lean and it has different impacts on the engine.  
**[0:54:24-0:54:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:24):**  Yeah, so again, it invokes the citizen scientists  
**[0:54:26-0:54:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:26):**  to do their own work, to try things.  
**[0:54:29-0:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:29):**  You've done a lot of work promoting and helping people  
**[0:54:32-0:54:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:32):**  learn more about biochar.  
**[0:54:34-0:54:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:34):**  WilsonBiochar.com is your website,  
**[0:54:36-0:54:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:36):**  you have plans there for killing,  
**[0:54:38-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:38):**  you have a lot of great information, you do workshops.  
**[0:54:41-0:54:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  Beyond that, is there any place else people you think  
**[0:54:44-0:54:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:44):**  can go to learn more, either other places  
**[0:54:47-0:54:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:47):**  that you're connected with or just other great resources  
**[0:54:49-0:54:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  out there about all things biochar?  
**[0:54:53-0:54:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:53):**  Yeah, please do go to my website,  
**[0:54:56-0:54:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:56):**  I do have a lot of free ebooks.  
**[0:54:58-0:55:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:58):**  I also have what I call the biochar cookbook,  
**[0:55:00-0:55:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:00):**  which is my own personal tips and tricks for using biochar.  
**[0:55:06-0:55:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:06):**  And the other place I would send people  
**[0:55:08-0:55:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:08):**  would be the US Biochar Initiative.  
**[0:55:11-0:55:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:11):**  So it's US Biochar, USBI.  
**[0:55:17-0:55:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  Gosh, I'm not remembering the website URL right now,  
**[0:55:20-0:55:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:20):**  I think it's USBiochar.org, I can't remember.  
**[0:55:23-0:55:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:23):**  Anyway, I'm on the board of that organization,  
**[0:55:25-0:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:25):**  we've been around for about 10 years.  
**[0:55:27-0:55:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:27):**  We've been the group that's organized the biochar conferences  
**[0:55:31-0:55:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:31):**  in the US, every couple years we have a biochar conference,  
**[0:55:33-0:55:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:33):**  we had one in Colorado last year.  
**[0:55:36-0:55:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:36):**  And we're kinda gearing up right now,  
**[0:55:40-0:55:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:40):**  starting to get a little more funding,  
**[0:55:43-0:55:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:43):**  and one of my projects as a board member  
**[0:55:46-0:55:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:46):**  is going to be to work on our educational resources.  
**[0:55:50-0:55:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:50):**  Because for the industry,  
**[0:55:51-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:51):**  the people are actually trying to make a living,  
**[0:55:53-0:55:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  being providers of biochar,  
**[0:55:56-0:55:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:56):**  they're running into all these things  
**[0:55:57-0:56:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:57):**  that you're talking about where people are very confused,  
**[0:56:00-0:56:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:00):**  there's some bad information out,  
**[0:56:02-0:56:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:02):**  or incorrect information out there  
**[0:56:06-0:56:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:06):**  that people are picking up on,  
**[0:56:07-0:56:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:07):**  and there's just very little guidance.  
**[0:56:11-0:56:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:11):**  Actually there are a lot of good resources,  
**[0:56:13-0:56:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:13):**  but they're scattered, and if you're new to it,  
**[0:56:17-0:56:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:17):**  you have no idea what's good and what's not.  
**[0:56:19-0:56:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:19):**  So what we're going to be doing is curating that.  
**[0:56:23-0:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:23):**  So we'll be looking at a lot of the stuff that's out there,  
**[0:56:26-0:56:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:26):**  and picking out the stuff that's really good,  
**[0:56:30-0:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:30):**  and helpful, and putting it on the website,  
**[0:56:33-0:56:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:33):**  and that should help ultimately build markets  
**[0:56:37-0:56:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:37):**  for the biochar suppliers.  
**[0:56:39-0:56:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:39):**  So you can't put it in the ground if you can't buy it.  
**[0:56:45-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:45):**  Unless you can make it yourself,  
**[0:56:47-0:56:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  which of course a lot of our permaculture roots can do.  
**[0:56:51-0:56:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:51):**  Even if you're making it yourself,  
**[0:56:52-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:52):**  you still need guidance on how to use it.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  All right, okay, so that's it for the interview.  
**[0:56:59-0:57:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:59):**  One quick takeaway here,  
**[0:57:00-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:00):**  and I'm going to use this potentially in the edit,  
**[0:57:03-0:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  is how would you define biochar?  
**[0:57:08-0:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:08):**  Biochar's just charcoal that you can put in soil.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:11):**  It's charcoal that's friendly to biology.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:15):**  So it's charcoal that it's appropriate to use  
**[0:57:18-0:57:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:18):**  for a soil purpose,  
**[0:57:21-0:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:21):**  and that's how, that's really,  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:25):**  I wouldn't define it any further than that,  
**[0:57:28-0:57:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:28):**  because it's going to be different,  
**[0:57:29-0:57:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:29):**  depending on your soil, depending on your crop,  
**[0:57:32-0:57:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:32):**  what's appropriate.  
**[0:57:33-0:57:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:33):**  Okay, one other quick one here,  
**[0:57:36-0:57:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:36):**  so if anything comes to mind,  
**[0:57:37-0:57:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:37):**  is there one thing that is a mind blower to you  
**[0:57:42-0:57:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:42):**  when it comes to biochar?  
**[0:57:47-0:57:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:47):**  Or maybe not to you, but to somebody else.  
**[0:57:49-0:57:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:49):**  Oh, okay, well the thing that kind of blew my mind,  
**[0:57:52-0:57:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:52):**  I mean, I was got intrigued by it  
**[0:57:55-0:57:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:55):**  because of the carbon climate implications,  
**[0:57:59-0:58:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:59):**  and it started to seem really important,  
**[0:58:02-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:02):**  and I was, and also for my personal use in my garden,  
**[0:58:06-0:58:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  which I grow a pretty great garden, I gotta say.  
**[0:58:11-0:58:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:11):**  The thing that really blew my mind scientifically  
**[0:58:14-0:58:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:14):**  was the electrical properties of char  
**[0:58:16-0:58:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:16):**  that I already talked about,  
**[0:58:18-0:58:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:18):**  and the way that, how important that is.  
**[0:58:22-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:22):**  I had no idea that microbes used electrons.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  I had no idea.  
**[0:58:27-0:58:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:27):**  I'm an engineer and not a biologist,  
**[0:58:29-0:58:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:29):**  so I was like, wow, that's pretty cool.

**[0:58:37-0:58:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-04-KelpieWilson-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:37):**  I think it'll help add to the library

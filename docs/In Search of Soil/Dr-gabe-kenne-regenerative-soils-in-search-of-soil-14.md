### In Search of Soil  (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:00:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Today it's all about the science of no-till and cover cropping based on real world experiences  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  with Gabe Kenney of the University of South Carolina.  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:30):**  In this episode of In Search of Soil, Gabe's going to share some of the results that he's  
**[0:00:33-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:33):**  seen working with farmers trialing different methods of agriculture like no-till and cover  
**[0:00:39-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:39):**  cropping and how those results have affected the soil compared to control plots in those  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  farmers' fields.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:46):**  He's also going to be touching on soil tests and the differences in soil tests and how  
**[0:00:50-0:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:50):**  the soil tests that you're getting may not be a fit for what you're trying to actually  
**[0:00:56-0:00:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  test for.  
**[0:00:58-0:01:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:58):**  More on that in this episode with Gabe Kenney.  
**[0:01:02-0:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:02):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  When you think about that direction that ag's moving in, that regenerative ag movement,  
**[0:01:10-0:01:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:10):**  and you think about some gaps in knowledge, are there areas that you think are particularly  
**[0:01:16-0:01:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:16):**  interesting and deserve a lot more research that maybe don't get talked about enough and  
**[0:01:23-0:01:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:23):**  that's where you maybe want to take your career, not just now, but over the next 10, 20, 30  
**[0:01:30-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:30):**  years?  
**[0:01:31-0:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:31):**  Yeah, for me, I think that, and maybe it's just my own personal timeline of experience  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:38):**  with this, but I feel like there's a lot more interest or change in direction with a lot  
**[0:01:42-0:01:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:42):**  of farmers looking more at biological aspects of the soil ecosystem rather than seeing it  
**[0:01:49-0:01:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  just as a thing that plants grow in and you add your nutrients and water and that's what  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:54):**  makes it grow.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:55):**  To start seeing that as this really complex microbiological community and all of the complex  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  interactions and results of that, I think is where I want to go.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  I want to start really trying to understand the things we can't see in the biology.  
**[0:02:14-0:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  What is happening as far as say nitrogen cycling or nutrient cycling capabilities on a molecular  
**[0:02:21-0:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21):**  level?  
**[0:02:22-0:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:22):**  How is that influenced by the way that we manage farmland from tilling and cover crops  
**[0:02:26-0:02:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:26):**  to other synthetic versus more organic or natural soil amendments, things like that?  
**[0:02:34-0:02:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:34):**  What do chemicals do to the actual microbes, the ones we know and the ones that we don't  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  know?  
**[0:02:40-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:40):**  What's happening to that ecosystem as a whole and how does that relate to the outcome that  
**[0:02:47-0:02:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  farmers are looking for in their yield and their productivity and their bottom line?  
**[0:02:51-0:02:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:51):**  It's easy for me being kind of a nerdy scientist in the lab to say, oh, I want to do all this  
**[0:02:57-0:03:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:57):**  stuff but in reality, this is the farmer's livelihood and how they live, their bottom  
**[0:03:05-0:03:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:05):**  line, their entire life depends on all this stuff.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:07):**  I can't just say, oh, let's try this without really having kind of evidence to show that  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:15):**  it can be a benefit.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:19):**  That's really interesting to me and I want to go into it in a way where I can continue  
**[0:03:23-0:03:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:23):**  to slowly start learning how this goes at a rate that makes people that want to get  
**[0:03:29-0:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  into it comfortable as well.  
**[0:03:31-0:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:31):**  I don't want to go in and be like, oh, we need to do this to make this happen because  
**[0:03:36-0:03:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:36):**  I feel like there's so much that we don't know yet that that's really hard to be able  
**[0:03:41-0:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:41):**  to say any kind of claim like that.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:43):**  I think there's still, well, maybe not still, but now two camps in agriculture.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  You do have that conventional school, which is more chemical tillage based and then you  
**[0:03:55-0:04:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:55):**  have the regenerative side of things, which is no till cover crop, no more let nature  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:00):**  handle things.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:01):**  I'm with you.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  I think a lot of times you can't prescribe solutions without a lot of that data behind  
**[0:04:08-0:04:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:08):**  them, without a lot of knowing behind them because ultimately the people you need to  
**[0:04:11-0:04:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:11):**  adapt these solutions who can make the big changes in agriculture, you're 100% right.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:15):**  This is how they earn their livelihood and they're not going to literally bet the farm  
**[0:04:20-0:04:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:20):**  on something that might be true and if it goes wrong, I mean, hearing it from someone  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:27):**  who's not a farmer, you know, I do not have a farm.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  I am not a farmer.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:31):**  So that's a hurdle that I have to overcome every time I start doing work with anybody  
**[0:04:38-0:04:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:38):**  here in South Carolina is I have to show them that while I have, this isn't what I do for  
**[0:04:43-0:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:43):**  a living, I've learned enough about it and I'm kind of partnering with them on this and  
**[0:04:49-0:04:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:49):**  hearing them and like, how do we together figure out how to have the outcome you want  
**[0:04:55-0:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:55):**  without any of the negative aspects that you've seen and you're trying to get rid of.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:01):**  Is there maybe one view that really stands out that's like, say a traditional long held  
**[0:05:06-0:05:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:06):**  view and ag that you have farmers question or have they stumble when they say, I don't  
**[0:05:15-0:05:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:15):**  know if I want to try that when you're the scientist and then they're saying, hey, no,  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19):**  this is going to work.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:20):**  This is going to work.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  And they're like, it just, it's a paradigm shift for them.  
**[0:05:23-0:05:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:23):**  It doesn't agree with how they've done things, but the regen ag movement starting to go in  
**[0:05:28-0:05:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:28):**  that direction.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:29):**  Is there something that really stands out as a tillage?  
**[0:05:31-0:05:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:31):**  Is it, you know, reducing chemical usage?  
**[0:05:33-0:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:33):**  Is it removing fallowing?  
**[0:05:35-0:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  Is there one of those that is just really deeply held?  
**[0:05:39-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:39):**  I think, you know, everybody has different kind of resistances to those different things,  
**[0:05:44-0:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  but the one that definitely stands out that I think it's the most pushback or that people  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:49):**  kind of have more of a wall up against changing in my experience would definitely be tillage.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  And I don't know if it's, you know, that's just the kind of the way that it's always  
**[0:06:01-0:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:01):**  been the way that they they've always done it, their dad or their granddad always did  
**[0:06:05-0:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:05):**  it.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:08):**  And I think some of that experience comes from if you maybe for whatever reason, there  
**[0:06:12-0:06:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:12):**  was a season where they couldn't till because of weather conditions.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:17):**  It was too wet or something like something happened that maybe they weren't able to,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  or they didn't get to it.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:22):**  And then they see other problems like weeds come up and things like that.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  And so it kind of confirms that mindset that they have to do it or this other problem is  
**[0:06:31-0:06:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:31):**  going to happen.  
**[0:06:32-0:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:32):**  But if you kind of go into the no till practice the proper way and with the proper expectations,  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:41):**  you'll kind of know what to expect over time and what to do to maybe stop from having the  
**[0:06:48-0:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:48):**  weeds come up, you know, more than what you would have seen if you would have tilled it,  
**[0:06:54-0:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:54):**  you know, or how to kind of reduce your weed pressure without having to go in and till  
**[0:06:58-0:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:58):**  it.  
**[0:06:59-0:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:59):**  And I think that's the tillage in general is definitely the one that that even guys  
**[0:07:04-0:07:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:04):**  that I feel like I've started to see their minds and the way their brains tick really  
**[0:07:09-0:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:09):**  change in a lot of aspects will still kind of like talk about, oh, maybe I'll go in and  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:15):**  and discuss and that and it's it's just seems to be the hardest thing for some of them to  
**[0:07:19-0:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:19):**  really let go of.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  I think the whole tapering expectations thing is huge.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:26):**  I mean, we're just we're just getting into NFL football season starting and a lot of  
**[0:07:30-0:07:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:30):**  fans and teams, you know, they put these unrealistic expectations on certain players or certain  
**[0:07:35-0:07:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:35):**  teams that might not be that good, you know, to begin with.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  And they're just non realistic to begin with.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:42):**  If you think about going no till, what are reasonable expectations that a farmer should  
**[0:07:49-0:07:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  think about when starting that system, making that conversion from tillage to no till?  
**[0:07:55-0:08:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:55):**  I don't really think there's a way you're going to be able to do it immediately without  
**[0:08:00-0:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:00):**  seeing some weed pressure.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:04):**  But that's okay.  
**[0:08:05-0:08:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:05):**  You know, like there are other ways that over time if you implement cover crops at the right  
**[0:08:09-0:08:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:09):**  time and don't have a fallow period, and then the following season after a cover crop or  
**[0:08:14-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:14):**  even after depending on what your cash crop is learning to leave some residue to kind  
**[0:08:19-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  of shade out weeds start that competition is a big thing for me that it's kind of you  
**[0:08:26-0:08:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:26):**  can't just immediately go no till and then immediately have all the benefits of no till  
**[0:08:31-0:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:31):**  that there's kind of a timeline that you've got to be aware of.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:37):**  And it's definitely not a concrete timeline like oh, after your first season, you can  
**[0:08:41-0:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:41):**  expect this or this.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:43):**  It's totally variable depending on people's operations, but you really have to go in with  
**[0:08:52-0:08:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  a kind of a flexible mindset knowing that you're going to make a change.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:58):**  And that's not the only change you're going to have to make.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:00):**  Like when you make that change that other obstacles are going to come up, and they're  
**[0:09:05-0:09:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:05):**  all solvable, but you just may have to kind of continue to think differently like okay,  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:10):**  this is a problem now like what is a way that I can solve weeds or whatever the other problem  
**[0:09:16-0:09:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:16):**  may be without disking everything up again.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:20):**  You know, there are plenty of other people now and in the days of podcasts and social  
**[0:09:25-0:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:25):**  media there are plenty of ways for people to get on and see what other folks have done  
**[0:09:30-0:09:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:30):**  that have been successful and what hasn't been successful and you have to be a little  
**[0:09:36-0:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:36):**  experimental on your own right when you're doing it.  
**[0:09:41-0:09:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:41):**  From where you sit, what's your view in terms of academia and science when it comes to no  
**[0:09:48-0:09:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:48):**  tell?  
**[0:09:49-0:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  I think there's you know peer reviewed, a farmer's going to see what his neighbor's  
**[0:09:54-0:09:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:54):**  doing how well it's working for him and he's going to maybe make a decision based on that  
**[0:09:57-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:57):**  and then some people are also going to be like well show me the science.  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:01):**  It's one thing to say this is a good idea, it's one thing to suggest it and hypothetically  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  it makes sense on paper but is the science there?  
**[0:10:10-0:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:10):**  From your vantage point when you think about no tell where do you think the science is  
**[0:10:15-0:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:15):**  right now in terms of substantiating or failing to substantiate its benefits?  
**[0:10:24-0:10:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:24):**  I guess there's kind of two sides to that.  
**[0:10:28-0:10:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:28):**  In kind of reading in my experience with the science there's plenty of experiments in science  
**[0:10:34-0:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  that's been done in the short term that may not show the greatest benefits of it but when  
**[0:10:40-0:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:40):**  you start to look at studies that are longer term and involve not just till and no till  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  but kind of coupling that with other more holistic or regenerative management practices  
**[0:10:52-0:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:52):**  that's when you begin to see the real benefits from it.  
**[0:10:57-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:57):**  So if you go online and you find a research paper or an article or a magazine article  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  something that is just looking at a season or two of tilling versus no tilling without  
**[0:11:11-0:11:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  any other kind of coupled variables in there, it's probably not going to look very good  
**[0:11:18-0:11:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:18):**  for the no till side of things but if you start to look at the more holistic picture  
**[0:11:25-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:25):**  of if you're starting with no till and kind of the next steps of using cover crops and  
**[0:11:30-0:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  paying more attention to fertilizer use and things like that over multiple seasons of  
**[0:11:36-0:11:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:36):**  time that's when you're going to start to see the results showing more benefits from  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  not just the no till but the no till and the other practices that start to come along with  
**[0:11:49-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  it once you start to kind of get your toes wet and the regenerative practices I think.  
**[0:11:55-0:12:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  And as far as farmers, you know, you've got your kind of peer pressure, not peer pressure  
**[0:12:01-0:12:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:01):**  but kind of peer review like their neighbors and other farmers that they're seeing and  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:06):**  the ability for them to access things online as well.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:12):**  I've definitely noticed that it tends to be the younger farmers that I work with that  
**[0:12:20-0:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:20):**  are much more aware of resources available to them online.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:27):**  And then there's some of the older guys that we work with that literally a reason that  
**[0:12:35-0:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:35):**  a couple guys would not cover crop a field that we were kind of suggesting that they  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:41):**  ought to is because it was right next to a church.  
**[0:12:46-0:12:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:46):**  I don't know if it's a church they went to or not, but the people, the congregation at  
**[0:12:50-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:50):**  this church would have kind of been, I don't want to say judgmental, but would have noticed  
**[0:12:56-0:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:56):**  that their field wasn't fallow in the winter and kind of it would have kind of got people  
**[0:13:00-0:13:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:00):**  talking about them and they just didn't want to have that happen or have people kind of  
**[0:13:05-0:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:05):**  judge the way that they're doing things or see that they're maybe doing things differently.  
**[0:13:08-0:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:08):**  So they didn't, it didn't shift, maybe they have now, this is a few years ago, but they  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:13):**  didn't shift that field into cover crop use because of a kind of peer pressure issue.  
**[0:13:19-0:13:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:19):**  And if we look at some of these views that people have where they're strongly held, like  
**[0:13:28-0:13:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  say they're anti-no till and they don't do cover cropping there, they follow that fallow  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:33):**  strategy and they till.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:36):**  Maybe that's just because that's the way they've always done it.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:38):**  That's the way the generation before them did it.  
**[0:13:40-0:13:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:40):**  And like I said, maybe they're not looking outside of other resources, at other resources  
**[0:13:44-0:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:44):**  to do otherwise, but then also they're weighing the risk of trying something different.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:51):**  If I do it, maybe it doesn't work.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:55):**  Based on your research and stuff that you've seen in the field, do you think that the perceived  
**[0:14:01-0:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:01):**  risk of going to a no till cover crop strategy in terms of field management versus a tillage  
**[0:14:11-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:11):**  fallow strategy is as risky as perceived?  
**[0:14:16-0:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:16):**  Or do you think that it's potentially individuals perceiving it to be riskier than it is?  
**[0:14:23-0:14:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:23):**  And if they were to make that conversion, we know enough now to say that results are  
**[0:14:28-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:28):**  probably going to be pretty good over the longer term, thereby, I don't say negating,  
**[0:14:35-0:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:35):**  but mitigating that perceived risk that you had upfront.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:39):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:40):**  It's like a long-term investment kind of thing or longer term investment and you have to  
**[0:14:44-0:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:44):**  be conscious of that kind of scenario.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  I mean, as a scientist, I can see that, but I'm not a farmer again, so I can definitely  
**[0:14:59-0:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:59):**  see that they do see that risk.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:02):**  And sometimes I think when we say terms like regenerative agriculture, that when people  
**[0:15:09-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:09):**  talk about making that switch, that it may be as a mindset of you have to, it's not just  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  trying one thing and adapting as you go, that you have to change all of these things at  
**[0:15:19-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:19):**  once to go from conventional to regenerative and making kind of multiple changes, large  
**[0:15:26-0:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  scale changes at once.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:28):**  It's scary.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:29):**  It's scary for anybody, whether you're farming or not.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:32):**  And so one way that we've, or one project that we have going on right now that's kind  
**[0:15:37-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:37):**  of really seen success in overcoming that, it's called the Cover Five project.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  And we've got, I think 10 or 11 farmers here in South Carolina throughout the state.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:47):**  And we basically got in contact with them because they had some level of interest in  
**[0:15:53-0:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:53):**  either trying something different or were fed up with the way that they had been doing  
**[0:15:58-0:16:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:58):**  things that weren't successful.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:00):**  And so they let us come in and we basically were kind of like, give us up or show us up  
**[0:16:06-0:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:06):**  to five acres of the poorest land that you have that you can't get anything to grow on.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:13):**  And we're going to help you manage that land and provide you cover crop seed for three  
**[0:16:17-0:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  years.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:20):**  With the equipment you have, there's no new equipment you need to get, nothing else.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:23):**  Like we're going to work with you with what you have, we'll give you cover crop seed and  
**[0:16:26-0:16:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:26):**  show you what kind of changes can happen over three years in this process.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:31):**  And the first time that we went out, so many of these people, you know, they were open  
**[0:16:35-0:16:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:35):**  to it and letting us do it, but you could tell there was a lot of skepticism and trying  
**[0:16:40-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:40):**  something different.  
**[0:16:42-0:16:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  So we started it in November of 2017, I believe, with a cool season cover crop.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:49):**  And I think it was like a six way mix.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:52):**  I can't remember exactly what it was, but these guys planted it and we gave them up  
**[0:16:55-0:17:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:55):**  to five acres worth to put in their crappiest spot.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  And we went back again a few months later in February or March and remet with them and  
**[0:17:05-0:17:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:05):**  kind of got opinions.  
**[0:17:07-0:17:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:07):**  And it was unbelievable with some of them, how just seeing something grow, even though  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:13):**  it wasn't a cash crop, seeing something grow on land that they had struggled with for,  
**[0:17:17-0:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:17):**  some of them have had that out of production for 10 years.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:20):**  Like their perception totally changed.  
**[0:17:22-0:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:22):**  They're like, Oh, I want to do this over in this other area too, and here and there.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:25):**  So that was a big learning step for me too, in that just kind of nudging people with like  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:33):**  little baby steps, like try this one or two things on this little part of your operation,  
**[0:17:39-0:17:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:39):**  see what happens.  
**[0:17:40-0:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:40):**  And then if you want to scale it up, you can scale it up.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:42):**  You don't have to make the transition from conventional to regenerative all at once.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:48):**  It's not a big step.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:49):**  You don't have to totally dive in.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:51):**  Just like, you know, kind of dip your toes in first, see what's going to happen.  
**[0:17:57-0:17:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:57):**  And it may not be the greatest thing.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:58):**  It may not be what you expect, but it's probably going to be something, a new experience that  
**[0:18:03-0:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:03):**  you can learn from one way or another.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:04):**  And then you move forward from that.  
**[0:18:07-0:18:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:07):**  How many people ended up participating in that program?  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:11):**  We started out with nine and I think now it's up to 11.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:15):**  We just had a few more that kind of hopped on later.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  And that's really all that I think we, when we wrote the grant, it was an NRCS grant.  
**[0:18:24-0:18:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:24):**  It was for up to 12.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:25):**  And so we were almost at kind of our limit.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:29):**  And so that was a big part of kind of the field work aspect of my dissertation.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  And I still, we're three years in.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:41):**  We got an extension to get it through April of next year so we can have three full years  
**[0:18:46-0:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:46):**  of cool season and warm season cover crop data.  
**[0:18:49-0:18:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:49):**  And all throughout this whole process, we've been taking soil samples and plant tissue  
**[0:18:52-0:18:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:52):**  samples and showing these people all their data and trying to help them interpret that  
**[0:18:58-0:19:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:58):**  data as well.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:01):**  But still every time I go out and visit these guys, I learned something new too about their  
**[0:19:06-0:19:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:06):**  operations and about kind of their journey.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:09):**  And it's just really interesting to see how in three years time people's perspectives  
**[0:19:15-0:19:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:15):**  have changed dramatically.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  And not everybody is as dramatic, but it seems like everybody that's involved is really on  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  board with continuing at least cover cropping in some of the practices that we've done.  
**[0:19:31-0:19:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:31):**  But it's really exciting to see guys doing their own research now and kind of calling  
**[0:19:38-0:19:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:38):**  me up and being like, hey, I read this, should I try doing X, Y, or Z instead of just kind  
**[0:19:44-0:19:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:44):**  of waiting for me to show up and being like, okay, what do I do next?  
**[0:19:49-0:19:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  Were those nine, now 11 farmers?  
**[0:19:54-0:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:54):**  Is it like, say somebody gave you five acres originally, has that same five acres been  
**[0:19:59-0:20:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:59):**  part of this program since 2017, assuming the farm got in early?  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  Or is it like five acres?  
**[0:20:05-0:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:05):**  Okay.  
**[0:20:06-0:20:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:06):**  So can you run through some examples of how you've seen, say, soils change on particular  
**[0:20:11-0:20:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:11):**  blocks that have really shown tremendous change, like plant tissue analysis?  
**[0:20:15-0:20:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:15):**  What have you seen there?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:17):**  How has this actually proved out when you look at the data?  
**[0:20:21-0:20:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:21):**  The plant tissue, there wasn't anything that really stood out.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:27):**  And I got to say, we've been relatively inconsistent on when we get tissue samples too from cover  
**[0:20:33-0:20:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:33):**  crops, because some guys have gone all in after the first season and we're like, okay,  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  I'm going to take this out of production and I'm just going to cover crop cool season and  
**[0:20:41-0:20:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:41):**  warm season for all three years.  
**[0:20:44-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:44):**  But other people were working with them and putting cover crop in during their normal  
**[0:20:49-0:20:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:49):**  follow periods in their normal crop rotation.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:52):**  So it's hard to compare all nine to each other.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  And even just a lot of seasonal variations and stuff trying to compare plant tissue tests  
**[0:21:03-0:21:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:03):**  and hasn't really lended anything fantastic.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:08):**  But there's a lot of interesting soil test information.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:12):**  And we've looked at your standard six inch deep soil tests.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:17):**  And then we also every year are doing soil samples at depth where we do standard soil  
**[0:21:23-0:21:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:23):**  tests here six inches and then we'll also go six to 12 and 12 to 24 inches just to demonstrate  
**[0:21:29-0:21:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:29):**  that these nutrients are also farther down in the soil that you don't just look at kind  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:33):**  of that top six inch plow area.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:37):**  And the biggest change that stands out in almost all these guys places is organic matter.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:45):**  Some of them are still tilling a little bit.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:47):**  A lot of them have really cut it down or have even found their whole operation.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:52):**  I'm like, oh, maybe I can go and only have to till when I need to or every three years  
**[0:21:57-0:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  or so.  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:58):**  But they're all cover cropping.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:59):**  We've got a lot of them in kind of rolling it down and planting into it.  
**[0:22:03-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:03):**  Some are planting in green.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  But by using that cover crop and leaving it down and having that residue, we've seen soil  
**[0:22:09-0:22:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:09):**  organic matter levels go way up for almost everybody.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:15):**  Even in some of them are in like the upstate of South Carolina, which is kind of a loam  
**[0:22:19-0:22:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:19):**  your soil and then probably a little over half the guys are in very sandy soil in the  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  coastal plains of the state.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:27):**  And it doesn't seem to matter what they're starting with.  
**[0:22:31-0:22:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:31):**  Everybody is having their organic matter levels go up.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:35):**  For people listening to this or watching this soil organic matter, I think people can understand  
**[0:22:40-0:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:40):**  it near the surface.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:42):**  And you get a lot of residue on top that gets worked into the surface just through natural  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:46):**  processes.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:47):**  But the deeper down soil organic matter, what's actually happening biologically below the  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:52):**  soil to increase soil matter at depth?  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  Is this just roots that are in the soil that have now the plants stop growing, the roots  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  are left in the soil?  
**[0:23:02-0:23:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:02):**  Is that how organic matter is being built in the soil?  
**[0:23:05-0:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  Where is the rise in organic matter on the soil test coming from when you think about  
**[0:23:09-0:23:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:09):**  what's actually happening in the soil?  
**[0:23:15-0:23:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:15):**  Various ways that it's getting in the soil.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:16):**  The first one being in the one that I think is most related to cover cropping practices  
**[0:23:22-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:22):**  and eliminating your fallow periods is that your plants have roots and those go to various  
**[0:23:28-0:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  steps in the soil.  
**[0:23:30-0:23:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:30):**  But there's a lot of plants need a lot of nutrients to grow and they don't have access  
**[0:23:34-0:23:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:34):**  to a lot of those on their own.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:37):**  And so through photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide to make sugars and  
**[0:23:42-0:23:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:42):**  they use that for their own energy to grow.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:44):**  But what they do is they send a lot of that sugar down into their roots and it's exuded  
**[0:23:50-0:23:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:50):**  out at their roots to attract kind of, I don't want to say symbiotic, it's kind of a symbiotic  
**[0:23:56-0:24:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:56):**  relationship that they attract these different microbes that they know are capable of breaking  
**[0:24:02-0:24:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:02):**  down and providing them with those kind of nutrients and the forms of nutrients that  
**[0:24:07-0:24:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  they need.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:08):**  And so as these roots are penetrating down in the soil, they're recruiting all of these  
**[0:24:15-0:24:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:15):**  microbes and by pushing those sugars out, that's, you know, a sugar is an organic material  
**[0:24:20-0:24:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:20):**  that's going out there.  
**[0:24:21-0:24:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:21):**  It's fostering the growth of bacteria and fungi.  
**[0:24:26-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:26):**  When there's bacteria and fungi present, there's going to be other stuff that eats bacteria  
**[0:24:30-0:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  and fungi present.  
**[0:24:31-0:24:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:31):**  And it just is the start of this incredibly large ecosystem of living things that are  
**[0:24:36-0:24:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:36):**  all organic in nature.  
**[0:24:38-0:24:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:38):**  So as those things live and die and eat and excrete things, like all of that is increasing  
**[0:24:46-0:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:46):**  the organic components that are in your soils.  
**[0:24:50-0:24:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:50):**  And so that's, you know, as far as like the, how does that get in deeper?  
**[0:24:55-0:25:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:55):**  The plant roots is definitely a primary way, but you also have to look at when you roll  
**[0:25:01-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:01):**  a cover crop down or bush hog it and you leave a residue on top.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  Over time that residue disappears and what's happening is that's breaking down.  
**[0:25:10-0:25:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:10):**  It's being degraded by microbes on the surface and that is also going down into the soil  
**[0:25:19-0:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:19):**  kind of through that microbial metabolism as well.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:23):**  And some things run off, you know, rainwater, things like that.  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  I'm not saying that every ounce or piece of organic matter from a residue is going to  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  go down into your soil, but a lot of it does.  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:31):**  Like if you have a healthy soil ecosystem, it's going to break stuff down faster and  
**[0:25:37-0:25:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:37):**  it goes into the soil quicker.  
**[0:25:40-0:25:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:40):**  So having cover crops kind of moves that sunlight energy and carbon dioxide in the form of sugars  
**[0:25:48-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:48):**  into your soil and that is pushing and promoting organic matter in the soil.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  And then when you terminate that cover crop and leave the stuff on the surface, you're  
**[0:25:59-0:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:59):**  also allowing all of that material, the opportunity to go back into the soil as an organic form  
**[0:26:05-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:05):**  that can be kind of eaten and decomposed and used by all the living pieces in that soil.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  Do you have a sense of organic matter contribution applied at surface versus at depth?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:20):**  One thing I see come up a lot is people will suggest adding on a small scale compost, on  
**[0:26:25-0:26:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:25):**  a larger scale manures to the surface.  
**[0:26:27-0:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:27):**  And sure, you're putting a lot of organic matter at the soil surface.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:33):**  Do you know how much maybe that is increasing organic matter relative to how much organic  
**[0:26:39-0:26:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:39):**  matter is being increased below the surface via root in microbial activity?  
**[0:26:45-0:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:45):**  Is the underground portion one to one do you think would surface?  
**[0:26:49-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:49):**  Is it two to one?  
**[0:26:50-0:26:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  Is it 10 to one?  
**[0:26:51-0:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:51):**  Do you have any sense of where that ratio might be?  
**[0:26:54-0:26:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:54):**  You know, I really don't.  
**[0:26:55-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:55):**  I really haven't kind of looked at the comparison over time of kind of like surface to roots  
**[0:27:04-0:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:04):**  or even examining different crop or cover crop species, like how deep those roots go,  
**[0:27:11-0:27:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:11):**  how deep should we look?  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:13):**  I really couldn't say what that would be.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:18):**  But in adding, whether it be compost or manures to the surface, you know, there's some nutrient  
**[0:27:25-0:27:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:25):**  value to that and organic matter in that.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:27):**  But a lot of the benefit from both of those things is also kind of inoculating your soils  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:35):**  with good or beneficial microbes.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:39):**  And so if you put them on the surface with some amount of organic matter from that material,  
**[0:27:44-0:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  it's going to promote their growth and then they'll be able to continue kind of migrating  
**[0:27:48-0:27:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  down into the soil and become a part, you know, an active productive part of that ecosystem.  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:54):**  So you're not, by adding compost in manures, you're not, or you shouldn't just look at  
**[0:28:00-0:28:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:00):**  it as adding a nutrient supply or an organic matter supply.  
**[0:28:04-0:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:04):**  You're also kind of inoculating that soil with other good microbes that can kind of  
**[0:28:11-0:28:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:11):**  help keep that system productive and balanced and cycle those nutrients at various levels  
**[0:28:17-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:17):**  in the soil profile.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:20):**  In knowing that we're building soil underground via the cover crop activity, how critical  
**[0:28:26-0:28:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:26):**  is the no-till part of it?  
**[0:28:29-0:28:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:29):**  On the plots that you've seen where farmers are still doing tillage, do you see a slower  
**[0:28:36-0:28:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:36):**  increase in organic matter because the tillage is speeding up microbial activity, which is  
**[0:28:42-0:28:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:42):**  volatilizing some of that organic matter, burning it off versus the no-till cover crop  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:48):**  plots?  
**[0:28:49-0:28:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:49):**  Are they increasing at a steadier rate because you're not seeing this buildup and then a  
**[0:28:54-0:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:54):**  dip with tillage?  
**[0:28:57-0:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:57):**  That's hard for me to say if we were looking at soil tests kind of before and after tillage  
**[0:29:04-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:04):**  events and doing it more frequently throughout the year related to when those events were  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:10):**  happening.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  I would definitely see more of that fluctuation.  
**[0:29:14-0:29:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:14):**  But we do with this project and a lot of the projects we do, we're basically doing annual  
**[0:29:19-0:29:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:19):**  or biannual sampling on places.  
**[0:29:22-0:29:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:22):**  The same time is typically around late October or November here and then again in March and  
**[0:29:28-0:29:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:28):**  April.  
**[0:29:31-0:29:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:31):**  And I haven't seen anything stand out from that, but I do think that if we kind of had  
**[0:29:37-0:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:37):**  a before and after sample, like a before planting and an after planting soil sample, or looking  
**[0:29:43-0:29:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:43):**  at the biological aspect or the organic matter, that there would certainly be influences from  
**[0:29:49-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:49):**  the physical disturbance of tillage, especially if it's following a cover crop where you've  
**[0:29:57-0:30:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:57):**  got this diverse cover crop and their root systems promoting a diverse ecosystem, you  
**[0:30:03-0:30:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:03):**  go in and basically just kind of demolish that whole community, I think there's definitely  
**[0:30:09-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:09):**  going to be a difference.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  We just haven't done that frequent of a sampling event following tillage, like before and after

**[0:30:19-0:30:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:19):**  Knowing that thought or thinking along that thought process and knowing some of the research  
**[0:30:24-0:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:24):**  that you've done, if I give you two choices, no till and fallow or cover crop with tillage,  
**[0:30:36-0:30:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:36):**  which one do you think could build soil better over the long term?  
**[0:30:43-0:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:43):**  In other words, is there a worse evil here?  
**[0:30:51-0:30:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:51):**  Is tillage worse than fallow?  
**[0:30:53-0:30:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:53):**  Obviously you want them both.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:55):**  You want the opposite of both.  
**[0:30:57-0:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:57):**  You want no till and cover crops, but if somebody does have to pick or choose, which would you  
**[0:31:02-0:31:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:02):**  rather have?  
**[0:31:03-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:03):**  Tillage?  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:04):**  That's tough.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:05):**  I think if it was me and this is his opinion, like don't anybody listening say, oh, I'm  
**[0:31:09-0:31:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:09):**  going to do this because Gabe said it.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  I think I would go diverse cover crops and till and then maybe hope that I would have  
**[0:31:18-0:31:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:18):**  the mindset of maybe minimizing that tillage or something along the lines and maybe not  
**[0:31:24-0:31:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:24):**  necessarily doing a super intense deep tilling that maybe I had been and maybe being able  
**[0:31:32-0:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:32):**  to adjust that.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:34):**  But I think going no till without cover crops can lead to some other issues that might not  
**[0:31:45-0:31:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:45):**  be great that might deter somebody from wanting to stay in just that.  
**[0:31:50-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:50):**  But I think if you have the cover crops, you're building that community, you're still putting  
**[0:31:53-0:31:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:53):**  stuff back in, you're just kind of ruining and rebuilding every time you till.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  What would be your worry in a no till, no cover crop model?  
**[0:32:02-0:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:02):**  What are some of those potential negatives that you might see crop up?  
**[0:32:07-0:32:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:07):**  If you're no tilling, you're still going to be doing a lot of planting and amendments  
**[0:32:17-0:32:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:17):**  to your soil.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:18):**  You're still running your tractors and equipment on your soil.  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:21):**  But if you don't have roots in there in the off seasons when it's normally fallow, I just  
**[0:32:27-0:32:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:27):**  worry that that can kind of create more compaction issues if you don't have a diverse, even a  
**[0:32:33-0:32:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:33):**  diverse cash crop rotation.  
**[0:32:35-0:32:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:35):**  If somebody is doing corn and the corn cotton rotation or something that's kind of the same  
**[0:32:41-0:32:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:41):**  thing over and over again and leaving it fallow, I think that's going to cause a lot more downstream  
**[0:32:47-0:32:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:47):**  compaction problems and infiltration issues versus if you have a cover crop in, those  
**[0:32:55-0:33:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:55):**  roots are going to be able to kind of go down and penetrate and kind of be a tillage for  
**[0:33:00-0:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  you to kind of help break up some of the compaction, create opportunity for pore space and better  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  soil structure so that you're not going to have those problems down the line.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:11):**  But then again, when that happens and then you go in and you till it, you ruin what was  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:15):**  already there.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:16):**  So it's kind of a double edged sword.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  But I do think that no till without anything else, without cover crop can potentially be  
**[0:33:27-0:33:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  a tough one.  
**[0:33:28-0:33:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:28):**  I guess if you go back to those NRCS principles of five ones of soil health, I mean, if you're  
**[0:33:33-0:33:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:33):**  not keeping the living root in the soil, you're not keeping a cover over the soil and you're  
**[0:33:38-0:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:38):**  not having diversity in the soil.  
**[0:33:43-0:33:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:43):**  So I mean, by going no till fallow, you're kind of removing three of those five right  
**[0:33:47-0:33:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:47):**  there while only really observing one out of five.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:55):**  Oh no till because you're not creating that cover on the diversity.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  Tying this into nutrient scavenging, nutrient recycling, I mean, you did an actual study  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:06):**  on this and you wrote about this.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  It's not yet published, but you looked at some winter wheat plots that had four different  
**[0:34:12-0:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:12):**  treatments, no till, no till with cover crops, tilled with cover crops, this study.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:20):**  And I realized it's a limited sample size.  
**[0:34:22-0:34:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:22):**  It's over a small period of time.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:23):**  But if you could extrapolate this and hypothesize and think about a practical example of a farmer  
**[0:34:32-0:34:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:32):**  applying nitrogen in their fields based on what you saw in these four different types,  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:38):**  again, no till, no till with cover crops, tilled, tilled with cover crops, what could  
**[0:34:44-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:44):**  a farmer expect?  
**[0:34:45-0:34:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:45):**  Is it something where if I'm putting nitrogen on a tilled field, I'm seeing less of it held,  
**[0:34:52-0:34:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:52):**  scavenged and recycled for the crop that might follow it, meaning it's going through the  
**[0:34:57-0:35:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:57):**  ground, ending up in the groundwater and the more regenerative systems are holding the  
**[0:35:01-0:35:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:01):**  nitrogen?  
**[0:35:02-0:35:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:02):**  Is that what the data is starting to kind of tell you?  
**[0:35:07-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:07):**  It's tough to say that here.  
**[0:35:08-0:35:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  We didn't really use nitrogen or any type of fertilization as a variable in this.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:16):**  It was the same throughout everything.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:18):**  I believe there was just a pre-emerge nitrogen application and then one application during  
**[0:35:29-0:35:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:29):**  the crop, but it was even for all of them.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:31):**  I can't even remember what that form was from 2017.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:37):**  But I don't think, at least the data that we analyzed here can say much about that.  
**[0:35:45-0:35:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:45):**  But aside from the study, just knowing what kind of tillage does to especially the surface  
**[0:35:53-0:35:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:53):**  of that soil is you're creating more oxygen to the microbes in the surface.  
**[0:35:58-0:36:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:58):**  So I think you mentioned earlier when you talked about that kind of burst of metabolism  
**[0:36:02-0:36:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:02):**  and breaking up organic matter.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:04):**  So if you're applying nitrogen and tilling, you're going to have that burst of microbial  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:09):**  activity because you've got more microbes with access to pore space and oxygen at the  
**[0:36:15-0:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  surface where you just tilled and they're going to chew everything up.  
**[0:36:18-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:18):**  If nitrogen tends to be a limiting reagent in microbial metabolism, so if you apply nitrogen  
**[0:36:23-0:36:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23):**  to that too, these guys are just going to consume and consume and consume and burn it  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:27):**  up.  
**[0:36:33-0:36:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:33):**  It may get burned up, but I don't think that's going to affect the soil's ability to hold  
**[0:36:37-0:36:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:37):**  it as far as runoff and stuff.  
**[0:36:38-0:36:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:38):**  I think you're just going to have more opportunity for microbial consumption of that material  
**[0:36:44-0:36:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:44):**  before it's going to have a chance to really get into the soil and stay there and be something  
**[0:36:51-0:36:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:51):**  that can provide to growing germinating seed.  
**[0:36:56-0:37:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:56):**  So given that, if you think about the study and the results that you've got to date, are  
**[0:37:03-0:37:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:03):**  there things that we can start to think about when we think about traditional practices  
**[0:37:09-0:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:09):**  versus more regenerative practices based upon some of the results that you've seen in this  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:14):**  study?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:17):**  Just from a very basic standpoint, looking at this study and what I got out of it, it  
**[0:37:22-0:37:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:22):**  just shows at a genetic level in your soil that it has the capability of providing nitrogen  
**[0:37:35-0:37:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:35):**  or of cycling and recycling nitrogen, to some extent in every single one of those plots.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:42):**  So if you till, that tends to have kind of a, it didn't outperform anything else, but  
**[0:37:48-0:37:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:48):**  these other levels of the regenerative practices in some ways, not necessarily every step of  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:57):**  the nitrogen cycling process, but in a handful of those processes outperformed the tilled  
**[0:38:02-0:38:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:02):**  ones.  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:03):**  So by moving into these regenerative practices, you're giving your soil more of an opportunity  
**[0:38:09-0:38:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  to do the work itself and provide for your crop rather than you having to do the work  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:18):**  yourself by putting something synthetic down.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:22):**  So if you're doing these regenerative practices, you're already, at least to some degree, thinking  
**[0:38:29-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:29):**  about your soil health, I think.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:31):**  And so this study can kind of show like, yes, this is happening.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:37):**  This is creating a genetic benefit in my soil.  
**[0:38:40-0:38:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:40):**  It has more potential to do this thing.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:44):**  Therefore maybe I can put less nitrogen down because it's being provided to the plant by  
**[0:38:53-0:38:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:53):**  the ecosystem that I'm fostering through these practices.  
**[0:38:58-0:38:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:58):**  It's interesting.  
**[0:38:59-0:39:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:59):**  And I've talked to a lot of people on the conventional side of ag and they are deeply  
**[0:39:06-0:39:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:06):**  rooted in the, we're going to need to apply nitrogen chemicals and they're trying to reduce  
**[0:39:12-0:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:12):**  application as best as they can, but they still think, hey, you're always going to have  
**[0:39:17-0:39:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:17):**  to apply it.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:19):**  Going out on a limb, looking at these studies, looking at what you know, not as a prescription,  
**[0:39:25-0:39:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:25):**  but this is you thinking, hypothesizing, do you think you could grow a lot of our common  
**[0:39:32-0:39:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:32):**  cash crops in a regenerative system without adding nitrogen in the form of whether that's  
**[0:39:40-0:39:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:40):**  an organic or inorganic additive.  
**[0:39:44-0:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:44):**  So if it's a legume cover crop, fine, we're not going to count that, but you're not going  
**[0:39:48-0:39:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  to put chicken manure on and you're not going to put a ammonium nitrate on the field.  
**[0:39:55-0:40:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:55):**  I think it can be done with the crops that we have.  
**[0:40:00-0:40:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:00):**  I think kind of the scale and speed at which agriculture productivity wants to go now would  
**[0:40:10-0:40:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:10):**  be slowed down.  
**[0:40:12-0:40:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:12):**  I think we would maybe have to adjust density and there would definitely have to be differences  
**[0:40:19-0:40:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:19):**  in rotations to increase diversity.  
**[0:40:21-0:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:21):**  But I think if you kept things the same, like only focusing on farmers, only a row cropper  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  is only growing kind of the big three, I think it's tough.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:32):**  I think you have to change things up.  
**[0:40:34-0:40:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:34):**  We have to think about other crops, other things we can grow and that are obviously  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:42):**  still going to be productive and go towards your bottom line.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:47):**  So that would be the harder part, implementing cover crops and then implementing other cash  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:52):**  crops and changing things up.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:56):**  I think it's much more feasible in that scenario.  
**[0:41:00-0:41:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:00):**  But if a row cropper that's just growing the big three wants to try and do that without  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:06):**  nitrogen supplementation, even regeneratively, I think is going to be really tough.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:10):**  I think you have to increase diversity beyond kind of the staple crops or whatever the term  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  was that you used.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:21):**  So instead of just looking at this new bushel per acre record, which I think in corn the  
**[0:41:26-0:41:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:26):**  corn they're predicting 181 bushels per acre in corn this year, and that'd be like a new  
**[0:41:32-0:41:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:32):**  record, just keep looking to creep that up over time.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:35):**  You got to maybe look at different metrics, building soil, increasing soil microbiology,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:39):**  increasing diversity, and maybe not getting that one huge corn yield of maybe you have  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:44):**  120 bushels, but you're also getting another second crop out of it.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  So your cumulative yield is bigger than your single crop.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:53):**  Exactly.  
**[0:41:54-0:42:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:54):**  And even looking at mixing things up like intercropping and kind of planting things  
**[0:42:03-0:42:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:03):**  in row of other things kind of at the beginning and end of the season.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  There are other ways that I think some fringe guys are just starting to get into that may  
**[0:42:12-0:42:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:12):**  be a way that we can still keep our general annual productivity up without necessarily  
**[0:42:19-0:42:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:19):**  focusing entirely on a super high corn yield or cotton yield or whatever it is.  
**[0:42:26-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:26):**  There's ways that you can incorporate other things where your operation on a whole from  
**[0:42:31-0:42:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  an economic standpoint is still thriving and you're still producing while also still fostering  
**[0:42:38-0:42:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:38):**  a diverse and healthy soil ecosystem.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:42):**  Different systems, more crops, more carbon into the ground.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:45):**  And that's been another big focus of yours is focusing on carbon sequestration through  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:51):**  agriculture.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:52):**  And I think that's one thing that a lot of people, I don't want to say they even take  
**[0:42:58-0:43:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:58):**  it for granted, they're just not even thinking about it as a yield from a crop.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  It's always measured by what I harvest.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:05):**  You're not measuring really the residue that you leave on the ground or the carbon that  
**[0:43:09-0:43:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:09):**  you put in the ground.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:11):**  But given the work that you've done in this, how do you view agriculture as a tool to sink  
**[0:43:18-0:43:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:18):**  carbon into the ground?  
**[0:43:21-0:43:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:21):**  I think it has such a massive potential.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:24):**  And if you would have asked me that question four years ago, I probably wouldn't have really  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:29):**  had much of an answer for you.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:31):**  But shortly after I started on doing this work with Buzz, he kind of sat down and he's  
**[0:43:37-0:43:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:37):**  like, we have these multiple years and hundreds of soil samples worth of data from all these  
**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:45):**  different projects that we kind of clumped together.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:47):**  And we're like, what can we find from this?  
**[0:43:49-0:43:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:49):**  And one thing that stood out like a spotlight when we started looking at it was the organic  
**[0:43:56-0:43:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:56):**  matter levels.  
**[0:43:57-0:44:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:57):**  And so we have about 500 sites that we looked at that and started measuring soil, like standard  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:06):**  soil tests and organic matter from the point that these guys started implementing multi-species  
**[0:44:12-0:44:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:12):**  cover crops on their land.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:14):**  And so we broke it down into sites that had been under cover crops for two years, another  
**[0:44:21-0:44:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:21):**  group for three years and another group for four years.  
**[0:44:23-0:44:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:23):**  So we could kind of see what that transition into cover cropping looks like.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:28):**  And when we looked at the soil organic matter levels, even in sandy soils in South Carolina  
**[0:44:34-0:44:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:34):**  where a lot of people think that you cannot build the organic matter, we saw like really  
**[0:44:40-0:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:40):**  significant increases across the board in soil organic matter just from using cover  
**[0:44:44-0:44:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:44):**  crops.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:45):**  Some of these sites were tilled, some were no-till.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:47):**  The other management practices were highly variable, but they all had just started cover  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:53):**  cropping at the time that we started sampling.  
**[0:44:55-0:44:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  And so seeing those numbers all go up was really exciting.  
**[0:44:59-0:45:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:59):**  And so in the paper I wrote about it, I very loosely kind of calculated that into what  
**[0:45:06-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:06):**  does that mean as far as the amount of carbon that's coming, that those cover crops are  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  pulling out of the atmosphere and putting into the soil and kind of what does that look  
**[0:45:15-0:45:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:15):**  like for the state of South Carolina.  
**[0:45:18-0:45:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:18):**  And we had numbers kind of a pounds per acre per year of organic matter change range from  
**[0:45:25-0:45:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:25):**  730 pounds per acre per year to 2,700 pounds per acre per year in the four-year long study.  
**[0:45:34-0:45:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:34):**  And that kind of calculates loosely to 400 to 1,500 pounds of carbon per acre per year  
**[0:45:43-0:45:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:43):**  that were moved from the atmosphere and put back into the soil through those plant root  
**[0:45:49-0:45:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:49):**  exudates and the plant material and the cover crop breaking down and going back into the  
**[0:45:53-0:45:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:53):**  soil.  
**[0:45:54-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:54):**  And so based on the census data of 1.9 million acres of farmland in the state, I just kind  
**[0:46:03-0:46:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  of used that vague number to calculate if all that farmland has started cover cropping,  
**[0:46:11-0:46:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:11):**  how would the, and we used our kind of average numbers that we saw just from our 500 samples.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:17):**  So it's definitely can't extrapolate that out accurately to the whole state, but if  
**[0:46:21-0:46:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  these numbers are loosely correct, we would be looking at an average farm size in South  
**[0:46:26-0:46:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:26):**  Carolina is 197 acres.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:30):**  We'll be looking at 50 to 156 tons of carbon per year moved from the atmosphere to the  
**[0:46:35-0:46:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:35):**  soil tons and statewide that'd be half a million to one and a half million tons back into the  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:42):**  soil from the atmosphere just from putting cover crops in.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:45):**  It's pretty remarkable when you think about it as a, it's kind of a free lunch, right?  
**[0:46:51-0:46:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:51):**  Cause you're getting all the benefits that you have.  
**[0:46:54-0:46:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:54):**  Of the cover crop.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:46:56-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:56):**  For the crop, the cash crops that you want to grow later on.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  If you think about that, is there a point where things start to slow down in terms of  
**[0:47:06-0:47:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:06):**  banking that carbon?  
**[0:47:08-0:47:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:08):**  In other words, can the soil only hold so much and isn't the whole point of putting  
**[0:47:13-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:13):**  organic matter into the soil to use it to stimulate biology for the crops that you want  
**[0:47:19-0:47:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  to grow?  
**[0:47:20-0:47:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:20):**  So in theory, I mean we can't grow organic matter infinitely in the soil.  
**[0:47:26-0:47:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:26):**  So does it hit an upper limit?  
**[0:47:28-0:47:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:28):**  Because at certain point like that you want to trade that organic matter that you're putting  
**[0:47:32-0:47:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:32):**  in the soil for nutrients that the crops can use.  
**[0:47:35-0:47:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:35):**  Whereas then it just caught in the cycle it's being used, but then it's being put right  
**[0:47:39-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:39):**  back into the ground.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  So it's kind of trapped in that system.  
**[0:47:44-0:47:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:44):**  And you can always have a goal of trying to put more in than you take out to foster that  
**[0:47:51-0:47:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:51):**  biologically healthy soil and that cycling of nutrients.  
**[0:47:54-0:48:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:54):**  But every soil type is going to have kind of its capability to hold what it can hold.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:01):**  Like you can't, you're not going to be able to necessarily change that type of soil or  
**[0:48:06-0:48:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  change what it is.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:07):**  You know, sandier soil is not going to be able to hold or have as much organic matter  
**[0:48:13-0:48:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:13):**  content as something that's lonely.  
**[0:48:15-0:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:15):**  It's just the kind of the physical nature of the soil is still going to limit what it  
**[0:48:20-0:48:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:20):**  can be.  
**[0:48:22-0:48:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:22):**  Or that's going to kind of, I don't want to say define what it is, but really kind of  
**[0:48:26-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:26):**  limit what you can do.  
**[0:48:28-0:48:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:28):**  But there's, at least from my opinion, like I don't think there's any wrong you can do  
**[0:48:33-0:48:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:33):**  by constantly trying to improve those organic matter levels.  
**[0:48:39-0:48:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:39):**  Especially if you're cropping or grazing, you've got to remember that you are constantly  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:43):**  taking out every single year as well.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:45):**  And that's what we've done for decades is just take and take and take and take.  
**[0:48:50-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:50):**  So maybe we've got decades of work to do to put it back in and put it back in and put  
**[0:48:54-0:48:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  it back in.  
**[0:48:55-0:48:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  Like in these four or five years that we've been doing this, we haven't seen that limit  
**[0:48:59-0:49:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:59):**  happen.  
**[0:49:00-0:49:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:00):**  We've seen things stop improving.  
**[0:49:04-0:49:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:04):**  And granted, if you're looking at the soil organic matter tests where these improved  
**[0:49:10-0:49:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:10):**  from say 2% to 2.2%, which is still a 10% increase, overall increase in your organic  
**[0:49:17-0:49:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:17):**  matter content.  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  So that's hugely significant, but we're not jumping from like 1% to 5%.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  But all these, because it's in a percent, it seems like it's such a small increase.  
**[0:49:28-0:49:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:28):**  You've only increased by 0.2, but that's 400 pounds an acre of carbon.  
**[0:49:38-0:49:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:38):**  It is like a 10% increase if you do go from 2 to 2.2.  
**[0:49:44-0:49:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:44):**  Is that significant in terms of biological activity?  
**[0:49:47-0:49:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:47):**  Is that significant in terms of how plants are going to perform in that soil to give  
**[0:49:51-0:49:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:51):**  people some perspective?  
**[0:49:52-0:49:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:52):**  Because like you said, you could say, it's only 0.2 up.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:55):**  Does that even matter?  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  If you look at it as far as that organic matter is microbe food.  
**[0:50:05-0:50:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  And so that is, in this study, 700 to 2,700 pounds per acre per year.  
**[0:50:13-0:50:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:13):**  So an additional 2,700 pounds an acre of good, like kind of healthy food for your soil microbes,  
**[0:50:23-0:50:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:23):**  then how much more are they going to be able to perform those, say those nitrogen cycle  
**[0:50:27-0:50:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:27):**  functions that we were talking about earlier?  
**[0:50:29-0:50:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:29):**  Like if you're able to foster a bigger and healthier community by just having more food  
**[0:50:35-0:50:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:35):**  for them, you have potential for a lot of other beneficial outcomes.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:44):**  Because we kind of put all these different studies together to do this organic matter  
**[0:50:49-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:49):**  measure, I can't tell you what the yield or production outcomes of all of these were.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  So I didn't relate this directly to kind of conventional yield outcomes.  
**[0:51:04-0:51:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:04):**  But I think it's a fair assumption to say that if we're providing healthy food for microbes,  
**[0:51:11-0:51:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:11):**  on top of the fact that you're providing the cover crops for them, that's creating the  
**[0:51:16-0:51:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:16):**  environment for them as well, that you're going to see beneficial outcomes, maybe not  
**[0:51:20-0:51:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:20):**  immediately in your yield outcomes, but you're going to see your soil structure start to  
**[0:51:25-0:51:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:25):**  improve.  
**[0:51:26-0:51:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:26):**  You're going to start to see your infiltration rates improve and other kind of soil aspects  
**[0:51:32-0:51:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:32):**  like that, maybe not directly in a couple years into your crop, but you're going to  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:37):**  be hugely benefiting your soil.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  And that over time is going to lead to production benefits.  
**[0:51:45-0:51:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:45):**  I know this isn't your area of expertise, but what are your thoughts on this?  
**[0:51:51-0:51:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:51):**  If you look at conventional ag, that's closer to a sterile soil than a robust soil in terms  
**[0:51:56-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:56):**  of the microbial community.  
**[0:51:57-0:52:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  There's obviously microbes in the soil, but they're not performing at the highest level  
**[0:52:02-0:52:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:02):**  and maybe there isn't a wide diversity of them.  
**[0:52:05-0:52:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:05):**  Do you find or do you think that if you provide the conditions for microbes to thrive, that  
**[0:52:14-0:52:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:14):**  microbes will come back, microbes will show up, microbes will populate the soil, microbes  
**[0:52:19-0:52:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:19):**  will build that community, or do you have to go the extra step of doing different things  
**[0:52:25-0:52:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:25):**  to try and put microbes back into the soil?  
**[0:52:32-0:52:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:32):**  I think that you will have success in doing the measures and they will kind of come back  
**[0:52:38-0:52:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:38):**  on their own.  
**[0:52:39-0:52:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:39):**  An example of how that can happen is that every different plant kind of knows or has  
**[0:52:48-0:52:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:48):**  its own microbes, soil microbes that it knows are going to be able to provide it with the  
**[0:52:55-0:52:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:55):**  nutrients that it needs and the form that it needs.  
**[0:52:59-0:53:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:59):**  So those roots will secrete and exude a particular type of sugar or carbon source that it knows  
**[0:53:07-0:53:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:07):**  that that bacteria or fungi is going to like.  
**[0:53:10-0:53:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:10):**  So it's trying to attract those particular things and they come back.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:16):**  In an entire soil ecosystem, kind of the way microbes work is if their food source or their  
**[0:53:22-0:53:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:22):**  kind of healthy, happy ecosystem starts to go away, they basically kind of make spores  
**[0:53:29-0:53:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:29):**  or kind of preserve versions of themselves that stay in the soil and will last for a  
**[0:53:32-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:32):**  long time.  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  And when the conditions are right for that thing to grow and be happy again, they'll  
**[0:53:37-0:53:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:37):**  come back.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:40):**  And they grow and reproduce so much more rapidly than humans and other things do.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:46):**  So those changes in bacterial and fungal populations occur much more rapid than things that we  
**[0:53:52-0:53:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:52):**  see on the surface.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:54):**  And so by creating conditions that are favorable to these various types of beneficial microbes  
**[0:54:01-0:54:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:01):**  is all we need, inoculating them through compost and renewers is absolutely beneficial.  
**[0:54:09-0:54:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:09):**  But that good, complex, diverse environment can come back on its own if you are increasing  
**[0:54:18-0:54:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:18):**  the diversity on the end that we can control.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:21):**  By increasing your crop diversity, by increasing cover crops, by not destroying those ecosystems  
**[0:54:27-0:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  with tillage, you're going to allow the opportunity for them to come back in a way that's going  
**[0:54:32-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:32):**  to benefit your crops.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:35):**  Yeah, that's great to hear because it makes things a little easier for anybody taking  
**[0:54:41-0:54:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:41):**  on these practices.  
**[0:54:43-0:54:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:43):**  You can easily put cover crops in the ground.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:46):**  It's a lot harder to get all those microbial species into the ground.  
**[0:54:50-0:54:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:50):**  So if you can plant the cover crops, know that, hey, they're dormant, they're there,  
**[0:54:53-0:54:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:53):**  they'll show up however they show up, that's great.  
**[0:54:57-0:55:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:57):**  Now, if you do all these things to improve your soil, eventually at some point you're  
**[0:55:02-0:55:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:02):**  probably going to be measuring the soil and what's in that soil.  
**[0:55:07-0:55:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:07):**  And one thing I found really interesting was the paper that you wrote comparing soil test  
**[0:55:12-0:55:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:12):**  methods.  
**[0:55:13-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:13):**  And I found it fascinating because I didn't even realize there was different methods of  
**[0:55:17-0:55:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:17):**  testing the soil.  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:19):**  So can you talk about that paper, why you thought that was important to compare two  
**[0:55:24-0:55:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:24):**  different soil testing methods and really outline the differences between those two  
**[0:55:29-0:55:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:29):**  methods and why one might be superior to another?  
**[0:55:33-0:55:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:33):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:35):**  There are lots of different tests and ways that you can use to measure your soil.  
**[0:55:41-0:55:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:41):**  A lot of them that are commonly used are pretty strictly chemical or physical in nature by  
**[0:55:49-0:55:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:49):**  looking at your infiltration or your soil structure, looking at the physical properties  
**[0:55:53-0:56:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:53):**  and also to standard soil tests that use different types of harsh acids to extract nutrients  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  and look strictly at the chemical component of your soil.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:04):**  Like what is the phosphorus, potassium, magnesium levels in the soil and experiments for decades  
**[0:56:12-0:56:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:12):**  had been done to determine based on these soil test rates and plant uptake rates, that's  
**[0:56:18-0:56:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:18):**  what's used to determine fertilizer rates that people get recommended by all sorts of  
**[0:56:26-0:56:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:26):**  land grant universities and industrial ag places like that.  
**[0:56:29-0:56:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:29):**  So there's lots of different ways and there are different extractants that are used on  
**[0:56:34-0:56:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:34):**  different soil types.  
**[0:56:36-0:56:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:36):**  The Malick 1 extractant is used commonly here in South Carolina.  
**[0:56:40-0:56:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:40):**  And that's what I used in this paper that I'm working on.  
**[0:56:43-0:56:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:43):**  And that's what we use all the time.  
**[0:56:46-0:56:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:46):**  Our land grant university here uses that.  
**[0:56:48-0:56:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:48):**  That's where we send our samples to get soil tested.  
**[0:56:52-0:56:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:52):**  That's the way that we look at things almost every single time.  
**[0:56:56-0:57:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:56):**  But what's lacking in those is really any aspect of what is happening biologically in  
**[0:57:03-0:57:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  soil.  
**[0:57:05-0:57:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:05):**  You can look at soil in a microscope and there are certain things that are big enough that  
**[0:57:10-0:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:10):**  you can tell what they are.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:11):**  But when it comes down to bacteria, they're so small that it's hard for most advanced  
**[0:57:20-0:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:20):**  microscopists to be able to tell what these things are or exactly calculate what they're  
**[0:57:25-0:57:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:25):**  doing or what their function is.  
**[0:57:28-0:57:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:28):**  And so there are these other kind of soil health tests or biological soil tests that  
**[0:57:33-0:57:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:33):**  can measure other things that act as a proxy for soil biology.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:38):**  One of them being like the Solvita CO2 burst test measures 24 hour or four day carbon dioxide,  
**[0:57:47-0:57:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:47):**  which is used to kind of determine the microbial activity in your soil.  
**[0:57:53-0:57:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:53):**  You dry soil and then you re-wet it to stimulate microbial activity and you measure how much  
**[0:57:58-0:58:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:58):**  carbon dioxide those microbes have respired.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:01):**  Because just like us, most of them need oxygen and then we breathe out carbon dioxide.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  So do they.  
**[0:58:07-0:58:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:07):**  You quantify how much carbon dioxide is in there.  
**[0:58:12-0:58:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:12):**  It's kind of something that you can use comparatively over time.  
**[0:58:15-0:58:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:15):**  You can see if your microbial activity is increasing or decreasing.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:21):**  And that CO2 burst test is part of the Haney soil health test, which uses a different combination  
**[0:58:30-0:58:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:30):**  of weak acids that are meant to mimic acids that plant roots use to kind of make nutrients  
**[0:58:38-0:58:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:38):**  available.  
**[0:58:39-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:39):**  And it also looks at the water extractable nutrient content of the soil, which is more  
**[0:58:44-0:58:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:44):**  representative of what's available to microbes.  
**[0:58:49-0:58:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:49):**  Because there's nutrients that are locked up in organic matter that are locked up in  
**[0:58:54-0:58:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:54):**  you know, parent material like rocks and stuff that can be broken down and exposed with harsh  
**[0:58:59-0:59:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:59):**  acids, but they're not in that actual soil ecosystem aren't really available for anything  
**[0:59:05-0:59:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:05):**  to use.  
**[0:59:08-0:59:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:08):**  So part of looking at this test and comparing these two testing methods was to see what's  
**[0:59:15-0:59:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:15):**  the better way for us to look at it.  
**[0:59:17-0:59:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:17):**  Like, are we measuring the right thing by looking at chemicals?  
**[0:59:20-0:59:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:20):**  Are we measuring the right thing by looking just at the biology?  
**[0:59:22-0:59:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:22):**  And so looking at the various aspects of these two tests over three years here and six crop  
**[0:59:31-0:59:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:31):**  rotations, we kind of used not only those soil tests, but also the fertilizer recommendations  
**[0:59:37-0:59:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:37):**  that came from both of those soil tests to see how much fertilizer was really necessary  
**[0:59:42-0:59:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:42):**  in these systems.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:43):**  And then which of those recommendations were more accurate at predicting a real observable  
**[0:59:55-1:00:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:55):**  yield that we could actually get in the sandy soils that we were in?  
**[1:00:00-1:00:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:00):**  That makes sense.  
**[1:00:01-1:00:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:01):**  So if you take a more traditional, how do I say traditional, I don't know the right  
**[1:00:06-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:06):**  word and you can maybe correct me, but you do a soil test that's based on this chemical  
**[1:00:11-1:00:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  analysis where we're just going to really test the nitrogen, the phosphorus, the potassium,  
**[1:00:16-1:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:16):**  et cetera, all the little minerals that are in our soil.  
**[1:00:20-1:00:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:20):**  And we have a regenerative soil, like where we're trying no-till, we're trying cover cropping.  
**[1:00:24-1:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:24):**  Are we potentially getting an inaccurate picture of what's in the soil or what our soil needs?  
**[1:00:32-1:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:32):**  I would definitely say yes, it's potentially inaccurate, but at the same time, I don't  
**[1:00:38-1:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:38):**  really know what's accurate.  
**[1:00:39-1:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:39):**  And that was kind of part of comparing these two.  
**[1:00:42-1:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:42):**  Like I compared the Haney test that is aimed at a more biological aspect and compared that  
**[1:00:49-1:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:49):**  to the standard one that's focused on chemistry.  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:52):**  And they tell me different things, but in looking at these and correlating all of these  
**[1:00:57-1:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:57):**  soil test numbers from both soil tests to the yields we got, there was certain times  
**[1:01:03-1:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:03):**  where one test was maybe more accurate in determining fertilizer rates than the other,  
**[1:01:12-1:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  but the other was better at different yields.  
**[1:01:14-1:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:14):**  They both are telling us different things, but it almost led to more questions because  
**[1:01:22-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:22):**  neither one was like a magic bullet that is telling us, oh, this is what I need.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  There's useful information from both for sure, but it really kind of continues to make me  
**[1:01:34-1:01:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:34):**  question like, is the way that we're looking at soils or trying to quantify these things  
**[1:01:38-1:01:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:38):**  in the soil, like are we really looking at it the right way?  
**[1:01:42-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:42):**  And at the same time, that's also why I got onto the metagenomics study to start looking  
**[1:01:47-1:01:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:47):**  directly at the biology to see if that's a better way.  
**[1:01:50-1:01:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:50):**  And that's going to take some more time and further down the line for me to really better  
**[1:01:55-1:02:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:55):**  understand that and link that to your conventional, sorry, not conventional, but our typical production  
**[1:02:02-1:02:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:02):**  outcomes and the things that farmers are interested in.  
**[1:02:07-1:02:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:07):**  But there's just so many different ways we can look at what's in the soil.  
**[1:02:13-1:02:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:13):**  And it's all useful to some extent, but we can't always do every single soil test and  
**[1:02:20-1:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:20):**  pull it all together.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:21):**  So it's really an experiment of like, what's going to tell us the most information?  
**[1:02:25-1:02:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:25):**  What's going to be the most useful?  
**[1:02:26-1:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:26):**  And it's hard for me to say this was better than this based on the information I got because  
**[1:02:31-1:02:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:31):**  somewhere the Haney test was accurate at kind of these more feasible yield outcomes that  
**[1:02:40-1:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:40):**  we see in the coastal plains of South Carolina.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:42):**  But the land grant university that we got the standard soil test from, like the chemistry  
**[1:02:48-1:02:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:48):**  based one was way more accurate at fertilizer recommendations and actual yield outcomes  
**[1:02:54-1:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:54):**  for people who are trying to get that higher end yield.  
**[1:02:59-1:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:59):**  So if you compare, if you take the two soil tests that you compare and they're part of  
**[1:03:04-1:03:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:04):**  a soil testing toolkit, how many other potential tests are in that toolkit for looking at these  
**[1:03:10-1:03:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:10):**  types of values around soil?  
**[1:03:12-1:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:12):**  So you look to, are there more in that toolkit?  
**[1:03:14-1:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:14):**  Yeah, there's a lot more and we're actually hoping to get funding on a project that's  
**[1:03:21-1:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:21):**  a couple of years, two or three years long, I think Buzz and I in the soil lab to test  
**[1:03:27-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:27):**  more of those on the same lands to not only test them, but also to see, to use various  
**[1:03:36-1:03:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:36):**  soil testing methods during the process of transitioning from conventional to regenerative.  
**[1:03:42-1:03:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:42):**  So not only like in a conventional system, which tests are telling us the most useful  
**[1:03:48-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:48):**  information, but also in a regenerative or as you're making that transition, like in  
**[1:03:53-1:04:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:53):**  a conventional system where it's more focused on tillage and fertilizer inputs, maybe the  
**[1:04:00-1:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:00):**  chemistry based test is going to give you information that's more useful to that system.  
**[1:04:06-1:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:06):**  But if you're trying to go regenerative, maybe a different test is going to give you more  
**[1:04:10-1:04:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:10):**  useful information since you're not looking just at chemistry, you're looking at biology.  
**[1:04:17-1:04:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:17):**  So hopefully that the ball gets rolling on that project and we can really start to see  
**[1:04:22-1:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:22):**  looking at more than just two, what's the best thing to look at on a whole scale of  
**[1:04:30-1:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:30):**  management practices.  
**[1:04:32-1:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:32):**  So for somebody who's trying to grow regeneratively, they're getting soil tests, they could potentially,  
**[1:04:39-1:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:39):**  not definitely, but potentially be getting a soil test that's a misfit for their farming  
**[1:04:47-1:04:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  management system.  
**[1:04:50-1:04:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:50):**  I think so, yes.  
**[1:04:51-1:04:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:51):**  You could get a soil test that says you have this much or you don't have this much of nutrients,  
**[1:04:57-1:05:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:57):**  say phosphorus in your soil.  
**[1:05:01-1:05:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:01):**  But if you have a healthy biological system and in lots of hyphen networks that are able  
**[1:05:07-1:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:07):**  to go deeper and beyond your plant roots, they have the capability of pulling that nutrient  
**[1:05:12-1:05:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:12):**  from other places and giving it to those plant roots.  
**[1:05:18-1:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:18):**  Versus a conventional system may not have that and you may have to supplement it more  
**[1:05:21-1:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:21):**  because you don't have that kind of scavenging and that partnership that a healthier biological  
**[1:05:27-1:05:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:27):**  ecosystem would.  
**[1:05:30-1:05:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:30):**  So I'm thinking if I'm a regenerative grower and I'm practicing no-till, I have cover crop  
**[1:05:35-1:05:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:35):**  problems and we assume that a lot of these things that we've talked about in this interview  
**[1:05:39-1:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:39):**  are happening.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:40):**  You're getting nutrients scavenging, you're getting nutrient recycling to some degree  
**[1:05:45-1:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:45):**  in this system because the biology is working.  
**[1:05:48-1:05:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:48):**  You're adding organic matter which is stimulating that biology which is helping us in a lot  
**[1:05:53-1:05:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:53):**  of ways.  
**[1:05:54-1:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:54):**  It's freeing up nutrients that are locked up in the soil, parent matter, the organic  
**[1:05:57-1:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:57):**  matter, all that type of stuff.  
**[1:05:59-1:06:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:59):**  Can I make the argument and just say a soil test is just a waste of time and energy?  
**[1:06:05-1:06:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:05):**  If I can't really tell if the information is accurate, like it might be useful, it might  
**[1:06:09-1:06:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:09):**  not be useful.  
**[1:06:11-1:06:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:11):**  What about this scenario?  
**[1:06:12-1:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:12):**  You're saying we can't quantify what that is but if you continue to get your soil tests  
**[1:06:21-1:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:21):**  regularly as you are doing these things anyway, you're doing these regenerative practices,  
**[1:06:27-1:06:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:27):**  that's providing you with the data.  
**[1:06:31-1:06:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:31):**  So you can see over time, maybe you can see your farm or your productivity increasing,  
**[1:06:41-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:41):**  you can visibly see your soil getting healthier.  
**[1:06:43-1:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43):**  If the soil test that you're getting is showing no change, then you can probably conclude  
**[1:06:48-1:06:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:48):**  like yep, this soil test is not telling me anything worthwhile and maybe try a different  
**[1:06:53-1:06:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:53):**  one.  
**[1:06:54-1:07:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:54):**  I think that if you're in that system and you look at the more biological soil tests  
**[1:07:00-1:07:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:00):**  that might be more of interest to you, it's looking at water extractable nutrients, more  
**[1:07:05-1:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:05):**  like bioavailable nutrients, I think we don't know exactly what is the best part of that  
**[1:07:14-1:07:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:14):**  to use for fertilizer recommendations and stuff like that.  
**[1:07:16-1:07:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:16):**  That's something that I'm still questioning.  
**[1:07:18-1:07:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:18):**  But if you're doing it, I think there's still a huge benefit in getting those soil tests  
**[1:07:23-1:07:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:23):**  and just looking at that data your own over time.  
**[1:07:26-1:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:26):**  And then you can do that for five years and you go back and you look at five years of  
**[1:07:29-1:07:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:29):**  soil test data, maybe you completely ignored all of the fertilizer or whatever recommendations  
**[1:07:34-1:07:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:34):**  that came with that, that's fine.  
**[1:07:36-1:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:36):**  But if you go back, you know how your productivity was or wasn't over that time and you go back  
**[1:07:42-1:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:42):**  and look at that soil test, you can probably see what's happening, like what is indicating  
**[1:07:48-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:48):**  what you saw or what was a good indicator, what's not.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  So I think that by doing soil tests, at least annually, if not more, that creates an opportunity  
**[1:07:59-1:08:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  for you to quantify what's happening on your system.  
**[1:08:03-1:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:03):**  I think that's a great point.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:04):**  Yeah, no, that makes a ton of sense.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:06):**  So I guess if you're going to get a soil test, one, try and make sure the soil test matches  
**[1:08:11-1:08:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:11):**  up with the system that you're going with and then know what soil test you're actually  
**[1:08:15-1:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:15):**  getting.  
**[1:08:16-1:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:16):**  Where I think a lot of times, I mean, I've done soil tests on just a garden level where  
**[1:08:19-1:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:19):**  you send it away and I really don't know what exact testing method they're getting.  
**[1:08:23-1:08:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:23):**  I'm just getting that result.  
**[1:08:24-1:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:24):**  So know what they're getting.  
**[1:08:26-1:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:26):**  And then, I mean, even within the biological geared soil testing, are there a few options  
**[1:08:32-1:08:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:32):**  and would it be worth, maybe you get a couple of those done and you get a couple of those  
**[1:08:37-1:08:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:37):**  done each time.  
**[1:08:38-1:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:38):**  So now you're essentially plotting those and you can say, okay, well, if this one's high,  
**[1:08:43-1:08:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:43):**  this one's low, well, here's where the mean ends up.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:46):**  This is probably where I'm at.  
**[1:08:48-1:08:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:48):**  Yeah.  
**[1:08:49-1:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:49):**  So you can start to be a little more like nerdy scientists like me and get multiple  
**[1:08:52-1:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:52):**  tests and compare them.  
**[1:08:54-1:09:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:54):**  Unfortunately, biological tests are more expensive than the chemical tests.  
**[1:09:00-1:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:00):**  And there are a few nots.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:03):**  For people listening, if they want to get biological soil tests, just to repeat that,  
**[1:09:07-1:09:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:07):**  what should they be looking at if they're going to a lab?  
**[1:09:11-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:11):**  The Haney soil health test is what I used in this paper.  
**[1:09:13-1:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:13):**  We also very frequently do PLFA tests, which is an acronym for phospholipid fatty acids.  
**[1:09:21-1:09:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:21):**  And that basically measures a particular cell membrane protein that's in microbes.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:27):**  And it's a cell membrane protein that kind of degrades relatively quick compared to other  
**[1:09:31-1:09:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:31):**  ones that may linger in the soil as it kind of turn into another form of organic matter.  
**[1:09:37-1:09:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:37):**  And so what that indicates is when you're measuring those, you can differentiate between  
**[1:09:41-1:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:41):**  like bacteria and fungi and protists, but because they degrade relatively quickly, you  
**[1:09:47-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:47):**  kind of get close to a snapshot of what type, what the microbial profile in your soil was.  
**[1:09:53-1:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  So the living microbial part, not stuff that died three months ago and is still, you know,  
**[1:09:58-1:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:58):**  just kind of a dead shell of a cell in your soil.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  Like what was at that time, most likely a living productive part of that soil.  
**[1:10:09-1:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:09):**  So that was Haney test, PLFA.  
**[1:10:12-1:10:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:12):**  There are new tests now and I haven't done any of these, but it's one that I think we're  
**[1:10:15-1:10:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:15):**  going to include if we get this new project rolling is looking at different soil enzymes.  
**[1:10:22-1:10:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:22):**  I don't know much about that.  
**[1:10:25-1:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:25):**  The details of that, like I want to look more into it and kind of get some of that data  
**[1:10:29-1:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:29):**  and play with it.  
**[1:10:30-1:10:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:30):**  But I think for now, a lot of what people are doing is the Haney test and PLFA.  
**[1:10:37-1:10:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:37):**  PLFA has been around for a while, but I think it's kind of potential usefulness in agriculture  
**[1:10:42-1:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:42):**  is becoming a little more common or at least a little more common to me.  
**[1:10:46-1:10:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:46):**  So.  
**[1:10:47-1:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:47):**  I imagine a lot of these tests are really like from hearing you describe this, we're  
**[1:10:54-1:10:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:54):**  kind of applying a patchwork solution to this.  
**[1:10:57-1:11:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:57):**  Like we just don't understand enough about the complexity of the soil and all the connections  
**[1:11:01-1:11:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:01):**  under there.  
**[1:11:02-1:11:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:02):**  Like it's so complex that you're trying to come up with a test to measure it, but you  
**[1:11:07-1:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:07):**  don't really understand what you're even trying to measure in the first place.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:09):**  As we know more about the soil, we can build a better test.  
**[1:11:13-1:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:13):**  Yeah.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:14):**  Like you can't, it's just too complex to be able to try and pick like where in this complex  
**[1:11:20-1:11:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:20):**  web, like where are we going to measure this?  
**[1:11:23-1:11:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:23):**  And you can measure it, like we can measure stuff, but how that, like what does that tell  
**[1:11:27-1:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:27):**  us in a system that's so complex?  
**[1:11:30-1:11:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:30):**  If it was as easy as maybe like a hydroponic system where you have water and you have to  
**[1:11:36-1:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:36):**  have these things to make plants grow in it, like that's easier, but you have a soil ecosystem  
**[1:11:42-1:11:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:42):**  where there's all this other stuff happening there that's just way beyond what we can understand.  
**[1:11:48-1:11:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:48):**  We can't see most of it visibly, so that makes it harder to understand.  
**[1:11:53-1:12:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:53):**  And there's so much influence day to day on weather conditions and temperature and climate  
**[1:12:00-1:12:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:00):**  and just your basic starting soil type.  
**[1:12:04-1:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:04):**  I could find a perfect answer maybe for what's the most important in a sandy coastal plain  
**[1:12:10-1:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:10):**  soil in South Carolina.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:12):**  And that same thing could be useless in a different soil where the complexity of that  
**[1:12:20-1:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:20):**  is different based on what it's physically starting at.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-14-GabeKenne-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:34):**  It's okay.

**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:20):**  Biochar â€“ plant matter turned charcoal via pyrolysis.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:25):**  It's an often talked about soil amendment that's able to put carbon into the soil  
**[0:00:32-0:00:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:32):**  for a very, very long period of time.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:35):**  The big question is, is it worth it?  
**[0:00:38-0:00:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:38):**  To answer those questions, today I'm talking to Francesco Todorici of Olympic Biochar.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:44):**  And he's going to talk about what biochar is, how it functions in the soil, how you  
**[0:00:49-0:00:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:49):**  can make it, what you should think about if you're purchasing it, and overall, is it  
**[0:00:54-0:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:54):**  worth it?  
**[0:00:56-0:01:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:56):**  This episode should fill in some of your knowledge gaps around biochar and give you a little  
**[0:01:00-0:01:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:00):**  bit more information to decide if biochar is right for you or not.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:06):**  So let's get right into it and talk biochar with Francesco Todorici.  
**[0:01:12-0:01:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:12):**  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  So Francesco, within the world of biochar, what would you say is your claim to fame or  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  what are you known for?  
**[0:01:22-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:22):**  What would you like to be known for within that world?  
**[0:01:25-0:01:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:25):**  Well here on the Olympic Peninsula, it's really promoting and working with citizen scientists.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:32):**  It's to get biochar into the ground.  
**[0:01:36-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:36):**  And yeah, it's really working with the individual and educational.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:44):**  Work shops have a business where I sell it, but it really is passionate about getting  
**[0:01:52-0:01:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  biochar into the ground.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:53):**  And one thing that I use occasionally is, no, don't let perfection get in the way of  
**[0:02:00-0:02:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:00):**  putting biochar in the ground.  
**[0:02:03-0:02:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:03):**  And in promoting the local citizen scientists, local users, because there's so much information  
**[0:02:14-0:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:14):**  out there about what's being done and research.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  And it's the local people that really jazz me in that what they're doing with it and  
**[0:02:25-0:02:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:25):**  what they're experiencing it from it.  
**[0:02:30-0:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:30):**  So I'd say that's it.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:31):**  It's really letting people know that it's not mysterious.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:36):**  It's not something that it's out there that somebody else do.  
**[0:02:41-0:02:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:41):**  You can make it yourself.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:43):**  It's simple.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:44):**  You can buy some.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:46):**  Play with it.  
**[0:02:47-0:02:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47):**  Have fun with it.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:48):**  And to help regenerate the soil and work with climate change as a solution for climate change.  
**[0:02:59-0:03:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:59):**  For me, that's important.  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:01):**  Yeah.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:02):**  And yeah, it's getting everyone to use it.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:08):**  How do you see the citizen scientists fitting into the greater piece of research?  
**[0:03:14-0:03:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:14):**  I like to consider myself a citizen scientist doing trials.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:17):**  I think there's good and bad to citizen science.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:21):**  You get people that maybe just make claims without doing all their testing.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:27):**  Yet there are a lot of people doing really good research and you can't rely on academia  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:31):**  to do it all.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:32):**  How do you view being a citizen scientist?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:36):**  I view it as someone, especially when one is working with biochar.  
**[0:03:40-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:40):**  And if they're working in a garden, whether they have their own garden or they're working  
**[0:03:45-0:03:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:45):**  in a community garden, put it in the soil.  
**[0:03:50-0:03:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:50):**  See what's going on and use your knowledge.  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:56):**  Some of the most, use your knowledge of the way the soils work.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:00):**  What's good for your plants.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  And every plant is different.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:06):**  In that, what does it need?  
**[0:04:07-0:04:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:07):**  What nutrients does it need?  
**[0:04:09-0:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:09):**  How does it work?  
**[0:04:10-0:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:10):**  Start small, small.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  And I think that role is driving, can help drive academia and real science.  
**[0:04:21-0:04:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:21):**  By that I mean, I have seen examples through the years having worked with biochar now for  
**[0:04:30-0:04:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:30):**  going on, you know, nine, ten years.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  Examples of established science, research science, university science, going down trails  
**[0:04:41-0:04:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:41):**  that citizen scientists have drawn them, brought them back.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:47):**  And I think the role of citizen scientists is we're observing this.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:53):**  Why?  
**[0:04:56-0:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:56):**  Let them, let citizen science be the driver for academia.  
**[0:05:03-0:05:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:03):**  I don't know why.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:05):**  And it's so much that academia is learning today as far as soil, as far as the interaction  
**[0:05:12-0:05:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:12):**  between microbes, mycelia, bacteria, that there's an old Da Vinci quote that we know  
**[0:05:21-0:05:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:21):**  more about the heavens above than the soil beneath our feet.  
**[0:05:25-0:05:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:25):**  And that's true today.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  We're learning daily more those interactions.  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:32):**  And so I think citizen scientists, they intuitively know or by observation what works and what  
**[0:05:40-0:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:40):**  doesn't work and will biochar work in what they are doing.  
**[0:05:48-0:05:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:48):**  So that's why I think the role of citizen scientists is that as long as you're not doing  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:52):**  no harm and it's especially for someone that's growing their own food, they're not going  
**[0:05:56-0:05:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  to go out there and actively do harm.  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:59):**  Yeah, I think it's as simple as you do some trials.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03):**  One plant gets this, one plant doesn't get it.  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:06):**  What do you see?  
**[0:06:07-0:06:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  And I don't think enough people do that.  
**[0:06:10-0:06:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:10):**  I think there's just too much blind following out there.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:14):**  Somebody says to do this, so I do it.  
**[0:06:16-0:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:16):**  And then they don't see results or they don't have a control to compare against, so they  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  can't tell if they actually see results or not.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:23):**  And then they say, well, it didn't work or it works great, but they don't really know  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:27):**  either.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:28):**  Exactly.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:29):**  And I've seen examples of citizen scientists with a community garden that I work with.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:33):**  Well, we started off with a research, a friend that works biochar that's been a biochar  
**[0:06:40-0:06:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:40):**  compatriot for years.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:42):**  We helped set up a trial in three different beds.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:46):**  So where we did a control native soil, biochar and compost, biochar compost and mineral balancing.  
**[0:06:55-0:07:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:55):**  And the joy of working with citizen scientists, and I heard it just on a webinar just the  
**[0:07:02-0:07:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:02):**  other day, was that after one season, the people in this community garden, it hurt their  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:10):**  hearts to see the natives and what the plants were struggling in the native soil.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:17):**  And they just added biochar and compost to everything, which totally blew the research.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:24):**  And that's OK.  
**[0:07:27-0:07:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:27):**  It was the citizen scientists.  
**[0:07:29-0:07:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:29):**  And we've done soil tests and showed the increase in carbon content and carbon extent and CEC,  
**[0:07:38-0:07:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:38):**  cation exchange.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:40):**  But that citizen scientists and we have to just be accepting that citizen scientists  
**[0:07:47-0:07:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:47):**  are going to do what they're going to do.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:49):**  It's they're not getting paid to follow a protocol.  
**[0:07:54-0:08:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:54):**  And the blind following of things that someone has heard can be an issue.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:04):**  And that is like they hear and we see today often this instant gratification biochar is  
**[0:08:11-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:11):**  not a fertilizer.  
**[0:08:13-0:08:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:13):**  And so people will throw biochar in and say, we didn't get results.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:19):**  And I've seen university researchers do this.  
**[0:08:22-0:08:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:22):**  We didn't get results.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:23):**  Well, they didn't work with the biochar, understand the properties of the biochar.  
**[0:08:29-0:08:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:29):**  Biochar is not a soil amendment in and of itself.  
**[0:08:32-0:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:32):**  And that's important to remember.  
**[0:08:34-0:08:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:34):**  Do you think that's maybe where the reductionist mindset gets in the way of I apply this and  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:41):**  I just want to try and quantify it down to a set result.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44):**  But maybe within some of these realms of soil, we don't understand it enough.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:50):**  If you don't understand what's going on in your system to start with, if you don't understand  
**[0:08:54-0:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  what you're adding to the system when you combine them, you don't know about either  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:59):**  one fully, you can only measure what you can measure.  
**[0:09:03-0:09:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03):**  But you may be missing stuff or factors in the experiment that you thought you had accounted  
**[0:09:08-0:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:08):**  for that aren't even playing a role in it because you just, you don't fully get what  
**[0:09:13-0:09:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:13):**  you're taking on.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  And I think that's where there's potentially a lot of error around this is like you said,  
**[0:09:19-0:09:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:19):**  I've talked to Gloria Flora about this and biochar and she talked to somebody at university  
**[0:09:24-0:09:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:24):**  to study and they did an inefficient test in her mind.  
**[0:09:28-0:09:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:28):**  They didn't fully understand the properties of that biochar, what temperature it was produced  
**[0:09:34-0:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:34):**  at, what the material was and they just applied it in a certain way and they didn't see the  
**[0:09:38-0:09:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:38):**  results and they said, okay, well, here's the results.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:40):**  But she's like, well, you're missing a whole bunch of stuff here.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:43):**  So you didn't really do an accurate test.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:47):**  Most definitely because all biochars are not created equal.  
**[0:09:52-0:09:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:52):**  There is the variation of what was the feedstock one used, what temperature was it made at.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:58):**  How was it quenched?  
**[0:10:00-0:10:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:00):**  How did one activate the biochar?  
**[0:10:05-0:10:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:05):**  The interrelationship of the life that one has in the soil that they're working with.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:12):**  And this is, it's easy to miss things and it's easy just to study, to look at the path  
**[0:10:23-0:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:23):**  of what I love is conventional farming, which is an application of NPK and say that's all  
**[0:10:32-0:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:32):**  the plant needs and learning to understand it's not all the plant leaves.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:38):**  So I agree.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:41):**  We end up, it's easy.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:44):**  Just think that we're studying something that's really going to be the end all and it's really  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:49):**  not.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:50):**  We may be missing something.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:53):**  How would you define biochar?  
**[0:10:55-0:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:55):**  I pulled up because it's a little blurb that we have and I'll read this and then go out.  
**[0:11:04-0:11:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  Biochar is a carbon rich product, product of a process called pyrolysis, which is the  
**[0:11:11-0:11:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:11):**  heating of a dry biomass to temperature, to high temperatures in an oxygen limited environment.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:19):**  Biochars are high, long lasting.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:22):**  For example, in Amazonian biochars have been carbon dated five to eight thousand years.  
**[0:11:30-0:11:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:30):**  And so it, needless to say, biochars used to grow plants is not current gaining steam  
**[0:11:42-0:11:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:42):**  as an important ingredient in the global regenerative agriculture movement.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:47):**  That's a little blurb that we hand out when people ask about biochar and how to activate  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:51):**  that biochar, why it's important in gardens.  
**[0:11:55-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:55):**  Biochar is, it's a type of charcoal.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:59):**  It's not biochar until it's biologically active.  
**[0:12:03-0:12:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:03):**  And there are many different properties of different types of biochar.  
**[0:12:10-0:12:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:10):**  I have seen myself when I make biochar myself, I personally have made biochar from scraps,  
**[0:12:19-0:12:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:19):**  from tree trimmings, from pine cones, from cow dung, from cat poo, made all these different  
**[0:12:30-0:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:30):**  biochars and they're all different, different properties.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:34):**  But it's any, it's the carbon that's left after the pyrolytic process.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:41):**  And depending upon what the source is that you can have biochars that have anywhere from  
**[0:12:47-0:12:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  a 40% carbon content to well over 80% carbon content.  
**[0:12:54-0:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:54):**  And that's important to know and it has different soil properties.  
**[0:13:00-0:13:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:00):**  So it's essentially carbon.  
**[0:13:02-0:13:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:02):**  And one other thing, it's a carbon that is called a recalcitrant carbon, which is a very  
**[0:13:08-0:13:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:08):**  hard, long lasting carbon because all the volatiles have been cooked off, burned off.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:17):**  So for example, if I leave a branch to rot, it will rot its carbon and that carbon will  
**[0:13:25-0:13:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:25):**  be beneficial.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:27):**  But those volatiles, many of those volatiles will off gas and release the atmosphere.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:34):**  Biochar when you use this pyrolytic process, you retain about 50% of the carbon that would  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  normally get released to the atmosphere retains bound up in the biochar.  
**[0:13:50-0:13:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:50):**  So that was a long answer, but.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  In a biochar, I think people think pure carbon.  
**[0:13:57-0:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:57):**  So if it's anywhere from 40 to 80% carbon and there's X left, what's that X made out  
**[0:14:04-0:14:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  of?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:05):**  What else is in there besides that carbon that you're adding to the soil?  
**[0:14:09-0:14:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:09):**  What's left in it?  
**[0:14:12-0:14:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:12):**  Yeah.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13):**  There are some minerals, depending on how one produces it, you may have traces of polyaromatic  
**[0:14:23-0:14:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:23):**  hydrocarbons, which different in the concentrations one have or the microbes will eat those, the  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:31):**  bacteria will eat those.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:34):**  So there are different traces that are left in there.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:41):**  For somebody looking to do this, adding the carbon to the soil in this recalcitrant form.  
**[0:14:48-0:14:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:48):**  So it's not going to be food for microbes right away.  
**[0:14:52-0:14:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:52):**  They're not going to go in and try and digest this fungi, aren't going to go after it right  
**[0:14:55-0:14:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:55):**  away.  
**[0:14:57-0:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:57):**  I'm putting carbon in the soil, which is beneficial for a few reasons as I see it.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:01):**  You're taking carbon out of the atmosphere and you're sequestering it in the soil.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:06):**  But there's other benefits happening in the soil and I'll let you speak on that.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:10):**  So when you put that carbon down, you tie it up from going into the air, what's happening  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:14):**  in the soil?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:15):**  How are you getting benefit from that compared to say compost carbon, which becomes a microbial  
**[0:15:20-0:15:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:20):**  food source?  
**[0:15:21-0:15:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:21):**  Excellent question.  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:22):**  And thanks for directing it a little.  
**[0:15:26-0:15:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:26):**  The biochar, if anyone watches this, I would suggest they just do a Google search on images,  
**[0:15:34-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:34):**  biochar, and look and see what the biochar looks like under an electronic microscope.  
**[0:15:42-0:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42):**  You'll come up with that literally thousands of pictures of how you make it, different  
**[0:15:47-0:15:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:47):**  kilns, but the pictures under an electron microscope are very revealing.  
**[0:15:54-0:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:54):**  It's a honeycomb structure.  
**[0:15:56-0:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:56):**  Biochar in itself, if I want to take and put a teaspoon of biochar in or teaspoon,  
**[0:16:03-0:16:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:03):**  tablespoon in my hand of biochar, it would have the surface area of about a football  
**[0:16:09-0:16:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:09):**  field.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:10):**  It is an enormous surface area.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:13):**  It's more air, more space.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  It also absorbs moisture.  
**[0:16:21-0:16:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:21):**  It is that surface area in that space becomes a home for bacteria inhabitant.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:31):**  Mycelia, bacteria die and what they do in their life, mycelia then will go and take  
**[0:16:42-0:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:42):**  the nutrients.  
**[0:16:44-0:16:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:44):**  Biochar is negatively charged.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  So biochar will attract to itself positively charged ions.  
**[0:16:55-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:55):**  And for example, nitrogen, it will absorb nitrogen and when it's not absorbed, adsorb.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:03):**  It's attached to the surface area of the biochar and it makes it available to the bacteria,  
**[0:17:12-0:17:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  to the mycelia, to the roots then to go to the plant.  
**[0:17:20-0:17:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:20):**  So that's the, and moisture, it retains moisture.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:25):**  So one then will water less and it will improve, the poorer the soil, the bigger change you're  
**[0:17:36-0:17:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:36):**  going to see.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  However, it does improve both the fluffiness of your soil and it's more of this relationship  
**[0:17:50-0:17:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  between what the biochar does in the soil.  
**[0:17:53-0:18:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:53):**  One of the things it does is it has a negative priming effect and this is something that  
**[0:18:02-0:18:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:02):**  they've only seen in the past few years.  
**[0:18:04-0:18:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:04):**  So for example, when one puts compost in the soil, that carbon, the organic matter in carbon,  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:12):**  I mean in the soil, will break down and release to the atmosphere.  
**[0:18:18-0:18:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:18):**  And one can measure that, that's measurable from year to year.  
**[0:18:22-0:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:22):**  When one puts biochar into the soil, it works.  
**[0:18:27-0:18:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:27):**  It has a relationship with that labeled carbon, unlike the recalcitrant carbon, so the carbon  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:34):**  of compost is a labeled carbon.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:37):**  It's more available to plants and will break down rather, you know, quicker.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:44):**  That labeled carbon, that relationship, this negative priming is, say for example, one  
**[0:18:50-0:18:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:50):**  has started off with 100% just straight labeled carbon in the soil, compost carbon.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:59):**  After a year, these numbers are just, for example, after a year you have 75%, after  
**[0:19:05-0:19:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:05):**  two years you'll have 50%.  
**[0:19:08-0:19:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:08):**  If one has biochar in that soil with that carbon, then in the first year you won't see  
**[0:19:17-0:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:17):**  as great a reduction.  
**[0:19:21-0:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:21):**  So your soil organic carbon is more stable and more long lived.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:26):**  And those are some of the things that the biochar does in creating this healthy soil  
**[0:19:35-0:19:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:35):**  bio.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:36):**  And you're one of the hotbeds of biochar, the Pacific Northwest, a lot of research is  
**[0:19:43-0:19:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43):**  being done up there in universities and at the citizen scientist level.  
**[0:19:46-0:19:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:46):**  There's a lot of great practitioners up there, companies up there.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:51):**  Speaking about this integration of biochar into the soil, why has the Pacific Northwest  
**[0:19:58-0:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:58):**  and states like Washington looked at this as a tool to help guide the soil?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:06):**  Interesting question.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:07):**  I think part of it may be because of the enormous amount of the forest industries that we have  
**[0:20:18-0:20:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:18):**  up here and the knowledge of seeing some of the effects of a healthy forest fire in the  
**[0:20:31-0:20:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:31):**  carbon that's left afterwards and looking at some of those systems.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:40):**  The part of it may be in some of the readings that I'm doing recently and it's just personal  
**[0:20:50-0:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:50):**  reading of the connection to the soil, the connection to the land.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:59):**  And this biochar is something that is just compelling when you start to look at and become  
**[0:21:12-0:21:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:12):**  aware of it.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:15):**  There's more research on it.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:17):**  And for example, in university researchers, there's a university researcher that I work  
**[0:21:21-0:21:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:21):**  with today.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:22):**  Well, I started doing some stuff about six years ago and this university researcher was  
**[0:21:29-0:21:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:29):**  referred to me to possibly participate in some stuff.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:34):**  And the university researcher said, and I won't divulge your name, but he said, you  
**[0:21:40-0:21:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:40):**  know, I really don't know anything much about biochar, so I'm really not your guy.  
**[0:21:45-0:21:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:45):**  And he was a university researcher with soils.  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:48):**  Well, in the course of about six years, this university researcher has become one of the  
**[0:21:56-0:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:56):**  foremost researchers and experts on biochar.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:05):**  So that's how quick it's happening.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  I think we're reaching a tipping point where the university researchers that are open to  
**[0:22:19-0:22:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:19):**  observing what citizen scientists, back to them again, are observing and what they're  
**[0:22:26-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:26):**  finding, they are compelled to start doing some research.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:32):**  And this researcher right now is doing a lot of research with compost and biochar.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:36):**  Can you talk about some of the trials that they've done and any results that you're aware  
**[0:22:41-0:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:41):**  of from those trials?  
**[0:22:43-0:22:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:22:44-0:22:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:44):**  I'll give one that I'm very aware of and this is a university researcher, Washington State,  
**[0:22:52-0:22:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:52):**  with a researcher that's now moved over to Montana.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:55):**  But they've done multiyear trials with biochar that they produced themselves using a flame  
**[0:23:01-0:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01):**  cap kiln, which is a type of, which is one way to create the pyrolytic environment.  
**[0:23:06-0:23:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:06):**  And this was on organic forms on the San Juan Islands.  
**[0:23:12-0:23:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:12):**  Anecdotally, one had heard, I had heard, prior to seeing this research that biochar inhibits  
**[0:23:20-0:23:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:20):**  the leaching of nutrients, especially in the Northwest where we get substantial rains.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:28):**  Nutrients in the wintertime will leach from the soils.  
**[0:23:33-0:23:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:33):**  So what this research was, they put the biochar in control, where they had control, and then  
**[0:23:40-0:23:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:40):**  with biochar, with biochar that was charged using beneficial microbes and seawater and  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:47):**  different things.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:48):**  And under the root zone of the plants, and they were growing dry beans, under the root  
**[0:23:58-0:24:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:58):**  zone they installed these little capsules that would measure NPK.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:04):**  And after the growing season, when they took, when they measured the amounts of NPK that  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:13):**  had leached through the plants and through the root zone down to below the root zone,  
**[0:24:19-0:24:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:19):**  they found that the plants that had biochar had between 30 and 40 percent less NPK.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:30):**  So that was retained in the biochar in the root zone.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:37):**  It wasn't making its way down to the capsule.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:39):**  It wasn't making its way down to the capsule.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:41):**  It wasn't leaching out.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:44):**  And that was the first time, it may have been done before, but that's the first time that  
**[0:24:48-0:24:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:48):**  I saw university research, it's Washington State, not Washington State, University of  
**[0:24:56-0:25:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:56):**  Washington research that quantified this.  
**[0:25:00-0:25:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:00):**  They've continued to do several, they've done like three years worth of research and showing  
**[0:25:06-0:25:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  different, over years, over years the greater benefit that one gets.  
**[0:25:16-0:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:16):**  So that's one.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  As a citizen scientist researcher, I was personally involved with a tomato grower here locally  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:25):**  on the North Olympic Peninsula, just outside of Port Townsend.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:30):**  In one year, he agreed to do some trials with some biochar.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:35):**  He grows all his plants in 20 gallon pots in a greenhouse, all his tomatoes.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:42):**  And so he was willing to dedicate four pots to biochar mixers with four different varieties  
**[0:25:52-0:25:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:52):**  of tomatoes.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  The first season we activated, we charged the biochar, just simple, I charged it with  
**[0:26:00-0:26:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:00):**  worm tea for about a week, just mixed it, stirred it in, and we put that in the soil  
**[0:26:06-0:26:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:06):**  mix at a 10% mixture.  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  The results the first year after we were done, and I let, again, being citizen scientist,  
**[0:26:20-0:26:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:20):**  citizen science, I let the tomato grower really kind of, we talked of how he wanted to do  
**[0:26:28-0:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:28):**  it.  
**[0:26:29-0:26:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:29):**  In this first year, he treated both plants, he put the same amount of moisture, the same  
**[0:26:35-0:26:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:35):**  amount of nutrients, fertilizer, for both the control and the biochar enhanced.  
**[0:26:44-0:26:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:44):**  At the end of the season, we looked at the results and he measures the results by number  
**[0:26:48-0:26:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  of fruit.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:50):**  He doesn't weigh them.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:52):**  And he said, you know, I really didn't see much change, any change.  
**[0:26:58-0:27:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:58):**  So let's revisit this next year if we're going to do it, what we're going to do.  
**[0:27:01-0:27:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:01):**  So the next year we came in and said, okay, so if we're going to do it, let's really stress  
**[0:27:10-0:27:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:10):**  the biochar plants.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:13):**  What he did in the control, he changed the entire soil.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:17):**  He took out the old, put in new.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:20):**  I said in the biochar one, let's leave it exactly.  
**[0:27:24-0:27:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:24):**  We just took out the plant, shook off all the soil from the roots and left it in there.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:30):**  We could still see the biochar there.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:33):**  And what the intention was to give it 50% less water and no fertilizer through the entire  
**[0:27:41-0:27:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:41):**  growing season.  
**[0:27:43-0:27:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:43):**  Well, being citizen scientist, he has volunteers come in.  
**[0:27:48-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:48):**  It was not 50% less, but it was substantially less, at least 40%, probably 40% less.  
**[0:27:56-0:28:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:56):**  And nutrients through the course of the growing season, it got fertilized a couple of times,  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:03):**  but much less than what his normal protocols are.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:08):**  When that season was over, he showed across the four different varieties of tomatoes,  
**[0:28:16-0:28:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:16):**  a 17% increase in yield.  
**[0:28:22-0:28:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:22):**  And the biggest thing he had was no blossom end rot, which is important for tomato growers.  
**[0:28:30-0:28:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:30):**  So he said, when he looked at that, he said, you know, I'm going to need to really kind  
**[0:28:34-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:34):**  of reevaluate, I've been doing the test.  
**[0:28:39-0:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39):**  Unfortunately, he saw the tomato farm we haven't considered, but that was an example.  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:44):**  Another organic farmer that I worked with that uses a different biochar, but he was  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:50):**  originally from Wisconsin and he was familiar with biochar from in Wisconsin.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:56):**  He grows all his tomatoes at his farm using biochar.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:00):**  Well, at our local farmers market, and this isn't big research, but they do a blind taste  
**[0:29:08-0:29:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:08):**  test of tomatoes.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:11):**  And his tomatoes, one, I believe it was three out of the four categories for taste.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:17):**  And when I talked to Max about this, Max said, I said, what do you think that is?  
**[0:29:21-0:29:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:21):**  He says, I think it has to do with tomatoes are very, besides the nutrients, tomatoes  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:27):**  are very susceptible to the amount of moisture.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:34):**  And the biochar gives them a constant moisture.  
**[0:29:38-0:29:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:38):**  So they don't run through that cycle of a lot of water, less water, a lot of water,  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:43):**  less water.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:45):**  It's constant.  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:46):**  So those are a couple of examples, a few examples of research, both university research and  
**[0:29:52-0:29:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:52):**  citizen scientists.  
**[0:29:54-0:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:54):**  Here in this and thinking about a lot of what I've learned during this series, already talking  
**[0:29:58-0:30:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:58):**  to people so far is the big driver of plant growth, one part of it is the health of the  
**[0:30:07-0:30:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:07):**  community of microorganisms in the soil.  
**[0:30:10-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:10):**  So if you're adding biochar to the soil, you're not necessarily helping that plant directly  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:17):**  per se.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:18):**  Like the plant is not going in and mining or doing anything with that biochar other  
**[0:30:23-0:30:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:23):**  than maybe taking some water that's maybe tied up in its matrix.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:28):**  So really what you're doing when you're adding biochar to the soil is you are amplifying  
**[0:30:34-0:30:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  or enhancing that biological community within the soil matrix.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:40):**  And that, if enhanced the right way, the optimum way for the plant you're growing results in  
**[0:30:45-0:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:45):**  better plant growth.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:47):**  That's how I see this chain of events.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:48):**  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:30:50-0:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:50):**  Exactly, you're facilitating a healthier soil biome.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:56):**  And there's been a lot of talk about soil, about biomes, both human biomes, soil biomes.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:04):**  And it's that enhanced soil biome where we have trace minerals available, where we have  
**[0:31:14-0:31:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:14):**  a healthy bacterial life, mycelia, worms are important.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:23):**  And what worms do in that?  
**[0:31:26-0:31:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:26):**  So yes, you're correct.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:27):**  It's the biochar in and of itself isn't feeding the plants.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:31):**  It's feeding all those wee beasties, as you might want to call them, in the soil, creating  
**[0:31:40-0:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:40):**  a healthy soil biome, which then create healthy plants.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:48):**  I heard there is an author that has written a book and he's written one.  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:58):**  It'll come to me, but his newest books is going to be the, he's talking about, because  
**[0:32:05-0:32:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:05):**  it's the saying, you are what you eat, and it's what his latest book that's going to  
**[0:32:11-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:11):**  be, David Montgomery is the author, is going to be coming out and he's looking at the title  
**[0:32:16-0:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  B, you are what your plants eat.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:20):**  And so if that isn't available, if in the soil biome, healthy bacteria, in those things  
**[0:32:30-0:32:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:30):**  that plants need to be healthy, nutritious, tasty, they won't end up in the food, in the  
**[0:32:38-0:32:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:38):**  plant, whether it be a leafy plant or tomato, a bean, and that doesn't then transfer over  
**[0:32:48-0:32:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:48):**  to us.  
**[0:32:49-0:33:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:49):**  So yes, the biochar of itself is just a means to assist in growing a healthy soil biome.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:02):**  And while we're doing that, we're generating the soil because most of our soils have been  
**[0:33:07-0:33:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:07):**  so depleted for whatever reasons.  
**[0:33:12-0:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:12):**  In being this healthy skeptic that wants to believe, which is how I quantify myself here,  
**[0:33:18-0:33:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:18):**  I think maybe the issue we see around these things are we fully don't understand what's  
**[0:33:25-0:33:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:25):**  happening below ground in terms of soil biology.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27):**  A lot of mainstream agriculture either dismisses it or downplays it.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  So there's not a ton of research being done there to begin with.  
**[0:33:37-0:33:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:37):**  Now you're adding something a little further out on the curve to something that we already  
**[0:33:42-0:33:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:42):**  don't understand that well.  
**[0:33:45-0:33:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:45):**  And you're adding this other variable in that is potentially enhancing that environment  
**[0:33:50-0:33:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:50):**  and making it better.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:52):**  And now we have to try and say, well, how did it make it better?  
**[0:33:55-0:33:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:55):**  How does this affect the plant?  
**[0:33:57-0:34:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:57):**  I do think it's just lack of understanding, or maybe it's time.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:01):**  You're not going to see results this season, or you might not see results next season.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:07):**  But if you looked at something like any soil built over 10 years or 20 years using a consistent  
**[0:34:14-0:34:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:14):**  regenerative management method, you would definitely see results over time.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:20):**  Rotational grazing is a good example.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:21):**  Year one, you'll see some results, but 10 years later, if you compare them against year  
**[0:34:25-0:34:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:25):**  zero, you'll see dramatic results.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:28):**  And I think that's where biochar and some of these other things maybe, I don't want  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:33):**  to say they fall short, but they get short changed is people want the instant result.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:39):**  They don't stick with it long enough to try.  
**[0:34:43-0:34:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:43):**  And yet, and we don't understand it fully to begin with.  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:47):**  So it comes down to me when I think about this is I don't see a harm in adding it.  
**[0:34:53-0:34:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:53):**  Can you think of it negative of putting it into the soil?  
**[0:34:57-0:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:57):**  So let's forget any positive benefit.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:00):**  Let's say there's no positive.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:03):**  Is there a negative that you could have by putting it into the soil?  
**[0:35:08-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:08):**  Well, I would suggest that if anyone is putting in, especially if they're putting in a biochar  
**[0:35:18-0:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:18):**  that they made themselves, to possibly be a little, there weren't this old test, this  
**[0:35:24-0:35:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:24):**  old one would say, if you're going to test your biochars, it's called a worm avoidance  
**[0:35:32-0:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:32):**  test.  
**[0:35:33-0:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:33):**  And so if you have a worm bin and a lot of people have worm bins or they have compost  
**[0:35:38-0:35:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  piles in the corner, in one corner of the, of your worm bin, dig out and put biochar.  
**[0:35:48-0:35:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:48):**  Just put a spoonful, a cupful of biochar in there or a shovelful, depending on how big  
**[0:35:54-0:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  it is.  
**[0:35:55-0:36:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:55):**  Go back a few days later, if the worms have gone away from the biochar to the other side  
**[0:36:05-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:05):**  of your bin, then there's something wrong with your biochar.  
**[0:36:10-0:36:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:10):**  My experience, we have just a small backyard.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:13):**  I live on a very small lot, less than 5,000 square feet, and they have a container compost  
**[0:36:21-0:36:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:21):**  that's open at the bottom, but it's closed with a lid.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:25):**  And we started just kitchen waste.  
**[0:36:29-0:36:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:29):**  And we throw in biochar because I have a plentiful amount of biochar.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:35):**  That is, over time, it is just teeming with worms with the amount of biochar we put in.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:45):**  There are organizations.  
**[0:36:47-0:36:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:47):**  There's the U.S. Biochar Initiative and the International Biochar Initiative.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  If anyone is going to get purchased biochar, then I would suggest that do your due diligence  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:02):**  and find out if those biochars, commercially produced biochars, have been tested, ask the  
**[0:37:09-0:37:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:09):**  question, have they been tested per the IBI, the International Biochar Initiative, testing  
**[0:37:16-0:37:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:16):**  protocols?  
**[0:37:17-0:37:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:17):**  Because they've been working on this for decades now, for a decade at least.  
**[0:37:25-0:37:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:25):**  So say somebody does want to buy commercial biochar from your company or some other company,  
**[0:37:30-0:37:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:30):**  I mean, you even find it on Amazon these days.  
**[0:37:33-0:37:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:33):**  What should you be looking for, either on writing, on the bag, the box, or on the website,  
**[0:37:41-0:37:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:41):**  if you're, say, growing a vegetable application?  
**[0:37:44-0:37:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:44):**  What characteristics do you want in that biochar to say, okay, this is what I want, or if you're  
**[0:37:50-0:37:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:50):**  deciding between two, this is what I don't want?  
**[0:37:55-0:38:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:55):**  I would look at, if one, again, I would ask the question, do you have your tests per the  
**[0:38:03-0:38:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:03):**  International Biochar Initiative soil classification, biochar classification?  
**[0:38:09-0:38:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09):**  That will, and then ask for a copy of it.  
**[0:38:11-0:38:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:11):**  That will give you several things.  
**[0:38:14-0:38:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:14):**  It will give you carbon content, and the IBI has different qualities of biochar that's  
**[0:38:25-0:38:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:25):**  starting as low as 40% up to over 80%.  
**[0:38:31-0:38:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:31):**  And from a premium biochar, I think it's, I believe if I'm correct, 40% you are considered  
**[0:38:37-0:38:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:37):**  to be biochar.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:39):**  But then there's different, 40 to 50 is one grade, and a premium biochar is over 60%.  
**[0:38:47-0:38:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:47):**  Many of your commercially produced biochars that are byproducts of co-generation plants,  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:57):**  and there's more and more of them coming online now, they will have carbon contents of well  
**[0:39:01-0:39:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:01):**  over 80%.  
**[0:39:04-0:39:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:04):**  And then look at your gradation defines, and a lot of those, are you buying chunky biochar?  
**[0:39:10-0:39:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:10):**  Is it self-produced?  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:13):**  Have they graded the biochar in some way?  
**[0:39:15-0:39:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:15):**  But the big thing is, ask the question, have you done testing per the International Biochar  
**[0:39:22-0:39:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:22):**  Initiative?  
**[0:39:23-0:39:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:23):**  And then there are a couple of other tests, because the International Biochar Initiative  
**[0:39:27-0:39:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:27):**  also has, whether or not they're certified, ask that they've done the testing for polyaromatic  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:37):**  hydrocarbons, PAHs, PCBs, and dioxins.  
**[0:39:42-0:39:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:42):**  Those are tests that you send them, they're sent off to third party testing labs, certified  
**[0:39:48-0:39:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:48):**  laboratories, and measure those.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:51):**  And they have standards for those.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:52):**  I would ask those questions.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:54):**  I would not have even thought of asking those questions until I started working with a co-gen  
**[0:40:02-0:40:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  plant in which I get their biochar, and before I put that biochar further on the market,  
**[0:40:09-0:40:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:09):**  I did my due diligence so that when someone like you or someone wanted to purchase some  
**[0:40:16-0:40:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:16):**  biochar, I can say, this is, it meets the parameters of the International Biochar Initiative.  
**[0:40:23-0:40:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:23):**  So, knowing that they've done those tests and you could look at results, if you were  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  using it for vegetables, would you choose something with a higher carbon content with  
**[0:40:32-0:40:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:32):**  a finer particle size?  
**[0:40:33-0:40:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  Yeah, a finer, you don't, yeah, you don't want fines, you don't want dust, although  
**[0:40:39-0:40:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:39):**  that's okay.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:40):**  But yes, a finer particle size just makes it more workable.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:46):**  If you have a big, because if I, when I use it, when I make it in a flame cap kiln or  
**[0:40:51-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51):**  in a large top lit up draft stove, when I put in a two inch diameter chunk of branch,  
**[0:41:01-0:41:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:01):**  I'll end up with about an inch and a half diameter chunk of wood that looks exactly  
**[0:41:07-0:41:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:07):**  like the branch that I put in.  
**[0:41:11-0:41:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:11):**  You see all the rings, you see everything, it's exactly that.  
**[0:41:16-0:41:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:16):**  That one can either crush up or not crush up, the soil will do the work and if you live  
**[0:41:22-0:41:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:22):**  in an environment where you have a freeze thaw cycle, the freeze thaw cycle over a few  
**[0:41:28-0:41:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:28):**  winters will break up your larger pieces.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:33):**  But for a home gardener, someone that has a little bed or someone's going to use it  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:37):**  in their, their raised bed or in, they're going to grow vegetables in pots like I do,  
**[0:41:44-0:41:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:44):**  the finer, the finer gradation is easier to use.  
**[0:41:48-0:41:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:41:49-0:41:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:49):**  I mean, I've, I make mine at home quite a bit.  
**[0:41:51-0:41:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:51):**  I just kind of use it in a modified cone kiln.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:55):**  I smash it up with a shovel in there.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:57):**  I don't mind putting it on course, personally I figure eventually it's going to break up  
**[0:42:00-0:42:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:00):**  from walking on it, harvesting stuff out of it.  
**[0:42:03-0:42:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:03):**  I'm not too concerned about that.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:05):**  One thing I have had people comment when I've posted stuff about this on Instagram is the  
**[0:42:11-0:42:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:11):**  effect of biochar in the pH of the soil.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:16):**  People are really concerned that biochar carries a higher pH, meaning it's more alkaline.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:21):**  I was putting it on pretty heavy to say, oh, you're going to drop the pH there.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:25):**  To mine, this is how I tested the pH because I'm making it at home.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:29):**  I'm not buying it from somebody.  
**[0:42:30-0:42:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:30):**  So I didn't have anybody to ask.  
**[0:42:31-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:31):**  I just put some in a jar, kind of crushed it up more, put water in, measured the pH  
**[0:42:36-0:42:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:36):**  of that water.  
**[0:42:37-0:42:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:37):**  It came out about nine.  
**[0:42:39-0:42:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:39):**  So two part question, one, is that an okay way to measure the pH of the char and what  
**[0:42:44-0:42:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:44):**  are your thoughts about biochar affecting the pH?  
**[0:42:49-0:42:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:49):**  Biochar, yes, it is alkaline.  
**[0:42:57-0:43:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:57):**  First of all, to answer one question, yes, that's an acceptable way to do at home to  
**[0:43:02-0:43:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:02):**  measure your pH.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:05):**  I know commercial composters that will test their compost just using strips.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:16):**  One can see biochars that test as high as a pH of 10 or greater.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:29):**  Then others, depending on how the process that they made, the pHs may be lower.  
**[0:43:34-0:43:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:34):**  That is another function when one does the IBI testing, it will show what the pH is of  
**[0:43:41-0:43:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:41):**  that biochar.  
**[0:43:43-0:43:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:43):**  It's listed on the test.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:47):**  And then you add this sort of thing that with water, one other way to lower your pH is to  
**[0:43:52-0:43:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:52):**  rinse your biochar.  
**[0:43:55-0:44:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:55):**  So you can lower it and some of the finds it will leach out.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  So over time it will balance and you're not growing plants in a straight biochar media.  
**[0:44:11-0:44:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:11):**  So it balances out over time that pH.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:19):**  I've heard that blueberries are susceptible to pH.  
**[0:44:24-0:44:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:24):**  They don't want a high pH.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:27):**  But there are examples of blueberry growers that are using biochar and having good results.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:35):**  So it is, know what you're putting in and again, if we start off back to what we do,  
**[0:44:42-0:44:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:42):**  do a little trial.  
**[0:44:44-0:44:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:44):**  How does it work?  
**[0:44:47-0:44:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:47):**  Is it hindering the kale that you're planting, the one plot versus the other, or the lettuce  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:54):**  or the carrots or whatever you're growing?  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:57):**  And do one's own due diligence.  
**[0:45:01-0:45:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:01):**  In this time where we're at, if I start getting more of a relationship with the soil, a relationship  
**[0:45:11-0:45:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:11):**  with what is alive with life, it's going to be better for me in the long run.  
**[0:45:21-0:45:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:21):**  The way I think about the pH too is it's not like you're adding lime to a soil where you  
**[0:45:26-0:45:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:26):**  apply water that instantly can lower the pH.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:30):**  You're applying something that has some ash residue on it that will slowly leach off over  
**[0:45:36-0:45:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:36):**  time.  
**[0:45:37-0:45:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:37):**  So it's not like you're releasing all that alkalinity into the soil at one point in time  
**[0:45:43-0:45:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:43):**  to shock the surrounding soil.  
**[0:45:46-0:45:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:46):**  Maybe in a vacuum, the biochar itself is alkaline.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:50):**  You are diluting it and then you've got to figure, okay, well, how much of that alkaline-producing  
**[0:45:56-0:46:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:56):**  ash and material on the char is going to release at any given time into the water?  
**[0:46:01-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:01):**  I just haven't seen a big problem.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:03):**  I've applied it heavy.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:04):**  I have videos on this where I've done it where I've put down a carpet.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:08):**  I've taken a bed and I've carpeted the bed with a char.  
**[0:46:11-0:46:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:11):**  So edge to edge, length to length, pour it on an inch thick, and then put soil on top.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:19):**  I've planted a cover crop on top of that and I've had cover crops five feet high growing  
**[0:46:24-0:46:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:24):**  on it within months after doing it.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:28):**  So that's where the citizen science in me, the anecdotal, what I'm observing is saying  
**[0:46:33-0:46:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:33):**  like it's not a negative.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:36):**  Whether it's a positive, okay, we can debate a lot of that.  
**[0:46:39-0:46:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:39):**  But I personally, like I'm not seeing a lot of the negative effect from it.  
**[0:46:44-0:46:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:44):**  So then it comes down to a time, money, more of a resource trade-off.  
**[0:46:48-0:46:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:48):**  Do you want to spend the money?  
**[0:46:49-0:46:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49):**  Do you want to spend the time making it?  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:52):**  I get those things might preclude you from using it, but I don't see a negative in terms  
**[0:46:57-0:46:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:57):**  of adding it to the soil itself.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:59):**  No, and what you described, I agree completely, and what you described your method of incorporating  
**[0:47:06-0:47:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:06):**  a biochar to your beds, where you put it in, you cover it with soil, then you put a cover  
**[0:47:11-0:47:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:11):**  crop.  
**[0:47:12-0:47:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:12):**  So what you're allowing the biochar to do is to let, I have a different first person  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:19):**  that really looked at the biochar that I had and said, hey, I want this, how much can I  
**[0:47:24-0:47:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:24):**  get of this?  
**[0:47:25-0:47:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:25):**  And he says, I'm a lazy farmer.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:30):**  Let nature do the work.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:32):**  And that's what you just described, was putting it in, covering with some soil, putting a  
**[0:47:40-0:47:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  cover crop, the roots will go down, the life from below the biochar will come up and it  
**[0:47:46-0:47:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:46):**  all mixes together.  
**[0:47:49-0:47:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:49):**  And that is the healthy soil biome we talked about before, so that when that cover crop,  
**[0:47:56-0:48:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:56):**  I don't know if you do a minimal till or no till, but that's another, if you leave the  
**[0:48:03-0:48:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:03):**  root zone in there and don't disturb that much, then that's, to me, that's the ideal  
**[0:48:09-0:48:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:09):**  because that life that you've created in soil is there and ready to give to whatever plants  
**[0:48:18-0:48:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:18):**  you plant in that.  
**[0:48:20-0:48:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:20):**  So yeah, you just, you described the way that I would tell people, if you have the time,  
**[0:48:25-0:48:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:25):**  the best way to do it, that's one of them.  
**[0:48:27-0:48:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:27):**  The other way to incorporate your biochar is I always ask the question, do you have  
**[0:48:32-0:48:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:32):**  a compost pile?  
**[0:48:35-0:48:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:35):**  And invariably the answer is yes, then mix it in with your compost.  
**[0:48:42-0:48:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:42):**  Mix it in 5 to 10% by volume and what that biochar will do, number one, it enhances the  
**[0:48:51-0:48:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:51):**  composting process.  
**[0:48:54-0:49:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:54):**  It also minimizes the greenhouse gases that are normally emitted during the compost, mainly  
**[0:49:01-0:49:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:01):**  nitrogen and it makes that nitrogen available to the plants.  
**[0:49:09-0:49:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:09):**  And what you've also done is by you putting it in your soil and letting it work over a  
**[0:49:15-0:49:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:15):**  winter and with a cover crop, when the compost is ready, the biochar is charged.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:23):**  And it's very, it's just, that to me, those are the two simplest ways of putting the biochar  
**[0:49:30-0:49:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:30):**  into your, incorporating it into your garden, into your soil.  
**[0:49:37-0:49:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:37):**  One concern I had somebody voice on a YouTube comment, and I'd never thought about this  
**[0:49:42-0:49:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:42):**  before, and it seems valid to me.  
**[0:49:45-0:49:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:45):**  You let me know what you think, especially being in the Pacific Northwest where there's  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:48):**  been a lot of industry paper mills.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:50):**  I don't know if there's been smelting up there saying trees are long-lived.  
**[0:49:55-0:49:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:55):**  They're absorbing a lot of nutrients out of the air.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:58):**  If you have a tree growing for a long time and it's absorbing pollution from the air,  
**[0:50:05-0:50:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:05):**  say it's downwind of some of the activity that happened pre-1980 where there's a lot  
**[0:50:10-0:50:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:10):**  of smelting activity and like EPA restrictions were a lot less than they are today, that  
**[0:50:17-0:50:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:17):**  wood would potentially have sequestered in it, heavy metals, bad things.  
**[0:50:25-0:50:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:25):**  Now you're taking that wood, you're burning it, and you're not volatilizing those heavy  
**[0:50:32-0:50:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:32):**  metals, but you're now just concentrating them into a char which you're putting into  
**[0:50:36-0:50:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:36):**  the soil.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:37):**  You are then growing food in.  
**[0:50:39-0:50:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:39):**  Do you have a worry around that?  
**[0:50:41-0:50:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:41):**  Or have you ever seen anything on that?  
**[0:50:43-0:50:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:43):**  Yeah, I've seen questions around that.  
**[0:50:47-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  And again, I go back to, especially for a commercially produced biochar, look at the  
**[0:50:56-0:50:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56):**  tests.  
**[0:50:58-0:51:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:58):**  And personally, the biochar that I work with, besides people that make their own and helping  
**[0:51:05-0:51:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  them make their own, is harvested from its hog fuel.  
**[0:51:13-0:51:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:13):**  Its hog fuel is when a tree comes into a mill to be processed, either in chips or as lumber  
**[0:51:20-0:51:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:20):**  or whatever, the first thing they do is they take off the outer layers and so that they  
**[0:51:26-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:26):**  have the pure wood underneath.  
**[0:51:29-0:51:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:29):**  That outer layer is hog fuel.  
**[0:51:34-0:51:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:34):**  So the biochar I work with, to give an example, it has that and then it also has about two  
**[0:51:39-0:51:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:39):**  thirds that and it's one third construction and demolition debris, which is certified  
**[0:51:43-0:51:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:43):**  to be no lead-based paints and no treated lumber.  
**[0:51:49-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:49):**  Now I've run several, several of a multi-year, every few years I'll run a test and the concentrations  
**[0:51:57-0:52:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:57):**  of the metals that are tested per the International Biochar Initiative are well below, well below  
**[0:52:07-0:52:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:07):**  anything that is considered harmful.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:12):**  So I don't have an issue with that because one of the questions that one needs to raise  
**[0:52:19-0:52:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:19):**  is when you put those, when you put the biochar in the soil, what do the microbes interact  
**[0:52:31-0:52:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:31):**  with and what do they, the microbes and the mycelia, the bacteria, what do they eat and  
**[0:52:40-0:52:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  transmute into something else?  
**[0:52:44-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:44):**  So how is, if we have X amount of metals in there, what's the concentration of those metals  
**[0:52:54-0:52:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:54):**  if one were to take a measurement when one initially puts everything in, if one takes  
**[0:52:59-0:53:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:59):**  a measurement a year later, two years later, is there a difference?  
**[0:53:07-0:53:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:07):**  And then all those metals taken up by the plants and all those metals then taken up  
**[0:53:19-0:53:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:19):**  into the fruit of the plants.  
**[0:53:23-0:53:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:23):**  So personally I don't have an issue with, I mean I would not use treated lumber, I would  
**[0:53:33-0:53:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33):**  not use something with lead-based paints.  
**[0:53:37-0:53:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:37):**  But other than that when I make biochar myself out of scraps of materials, I'll sometimes,  
**[0:53:42-0:53:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:42):**  I store firewood on wood pallets, sometimes after a couple of years I pull those pallets  
**[0:53:49-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:49):**  out, some of the wood is rotten, some of the wood is still good and I just pyrolyze it  
**[0:53:53-0:53:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:53):**  well and make biochar.  
**[0:53:54-0:53:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:54):**  Right.  
**[0:53:55-0:53:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:55):**  Yeah and I think, you know, where are you making it?  
**[0:53:58-0:54:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:58):**  People making it on a home scale, homestead level, a lot of times they have brush around.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  You know probably if your site used to be a foundry or some other commercial site, if  
**[0:54:11-0:54:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:11):**  you know it's never been that or zoned industrial, well then you know okay the stuff growing  
**[0:54:15-0:54:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:15):**  on it probably isn't absorbing heavy metals from the soil, from activity on that soil.  
**[0:54:21-0:54:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:21):**  Maybe there was some stuff drifted in but then I could make the argument that stuff's  
**[0:54:24-0:54:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:24):**  already in the soil anyway.  
**[0:54:27-0:54:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  You know.  
**[0:54:28-0:54:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:28):**  And it's probably already in your food already because it's drifted into the soil, it's in  
**[0:54:32-0:54:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:32):**  the soil and it's, if the plants uptake it then it's there.  
**[0:54:37-0:54:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:37):**  So yeah.  
**[0:54:40-0:54:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:40):**  In terms of application rate, what are your thoughts on that per square foot or per hundred  
**[0:54:45-0:54:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:45):**  square foot basis?  
**[0:54:46-0:54:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:46):**  For people who want to get started in this, if they're buying some, a lot of times you  
**[0:54:50-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:50):**  see it sold in small bags, maybe that's a gallon size.  
**[0:54:55-0:55:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:55):**  How much should you start with so you are kind of balancing that cost to getting enough  
**[0:55:03-0:55:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:03):**  in there to matter ratio?  
**[0:55:07-0:55:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:07):**  Well I think whatever one gets in there will matter over time.  
**[0:55:14-0:55:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:14):**  Some of the rates goes back to if, and I'm sure you've seen it, but one looks at Terra  
**[0:55:19-0:55:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:19):**  Preta del Indio when the researchers and the people that are actually working with behind  
**[0:55:27-0:55:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:27):**  the International Biochar Initiative and researchers, Johannes Lehmann from Cornell University.  
**[0:55:34-0:55:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:34):**  Back in 2008 I believe it was, they went to the Amazon and where they looked at these  
**[0:55:42-0:55:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:42):**  biochar-enriched soils, these charcoal-enriched soils.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:48):**  What they found at that time was some rates of, you know, they measured the carbon 20%  
**[0:55:55-0:56:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:55):**  and so they've been talking about 20% and I think 20%, I think for an initial application,  
**[0:56:03-0:56:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:03):**  I mean if you make it yourself and you want to do it fine, I think that personally would  
**[0:56:08-0:56:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:08):**  be a little bit high.  
**[0:56:10-0:56:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:10):**  I recommend rule of thumbs, rule of thumb.  
**[0:56:14-0:56:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:14):**  If you're talking about in the top six inches of soil, if you wanted a 10% by volume biochar,  
**[0:56:25-0:56:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:25):**  that would be roughly 40 gallons per 100 square feet.  
**[0:56:33-0:56:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:33):**  That would be for 10%.  
**[0:56:38-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:38):**  That can be expensive if you're buying it yourself.  
**[0:56:41-0:56:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  Then the other one is, so I say, and if you start off with, start off with less.  
**[0:56:47-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:47):**  If you put in 5%, that's 20 gallons per 100 square feet.  
**[0:56:54-0:56:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:54):**  It's sufficient to get things going and even less than that is sufficient, but 20 gallons  
**[0:56:59-0:57:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:59):**  per 100 square feet, usually, you know, I'll usually work with that where people are working  
**[0:57:06-0:57:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:06):**  with.  
**[0:57:09-0:57:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:09):**  So that's a good rule of thumb.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:11):**  Five percent is 20 gallons per 100 square feet.  
**[0:57:15-0:57:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:15):**  Ten percent is 40 gallons per 100 square feet for by volume measurement in the top six inches  
**[0:57:22-0:57:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:22):**  of your soil.  
**[0:57:24-0:57:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:24):**  And if you're putting biochar in your compost, then put in a 5 to 10% because most compost,  
**[0:57:32-0:57:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:32):**  especially if you're using kitchen scraps, that will break down by volume.  
**[0:57:38-0:57:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:38):**  So if I start off with even commercial composters, they'll start off with a large pile that say  
**[0:57:44-0:57:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:44):**  is 100 cubic yards.  
**[0:57:48-0:57:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:48):**  And after the composting process, it will have shrunk down to maybe 60 cubic yards.  
**[0:57:56-0:58:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:56):**  Well if they put in, say, just for conversation, for ease of math, so if you put in 5% biochar  
**[0:58:05-0:58:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:05):**  in a 100 cubic yards compost pile and at the end of the compost price process, you have  
**[0:58:14-0:58:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:14):**  50 cubic yards, the biochar hasn't shrunk down.  
**[0:58:21-0:58:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:21):**  So that 5% by volume is 10% by volume.  
**[0:58:26-0:58:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:26):**  So you can put in less in your compost and end up with a higher volume composition of  
**[0:58:32-0:58:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:32):**  your biochar.  
**[0:58:34-0:58:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:34):**  But those are the numbers that I normally use.  
**[0:58:36-0:58:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:36):**  There's been a couple of ways you've talked about producing it in a blanket on the first  
**[0:58:45-0:58:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:45):**  one.  
**[0:58:46-0:58:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:46):**  Cap.  
**[0:58:47-0:58:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:47):**  Flame cap kiln.  
**[0:58:48-0:58:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:48):**  Yeah, a flame cap kiln, top lit updraft stove.  
**[0:58:56-0:58:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:56):**  People you can do them in cone kilns.  
**[0:58:58-0:59:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:58):**  What are your thoughts on production methodology versus final results?  
**[0:59:06-0:59:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:06):**  I use a cone kiln, it's open top and I've had some people say, well you're not going  
**[0:59:10-0:59:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:10):**  to get as good of results out of that is the kind where, and again I can't remember the  
**[0:59:15-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:15):**  name I'm blanking on right now, where you have a smaller vessel that you pack with wood,  
**[0:59:19-0:59:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:19):**  you put that inside another vessel.  
**[0:59:22-0:59:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:22):**  A retort.  
**[0:59:23-0:59:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:23):**  A retort and you light around that.  
**[0:59:25-0:59:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:25):**  Are you going to see different results going from a kiln to a retort?  
**[0:59:30-0:59:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:30):**  You know, you will see some different results.  
**[0:59:33-0:59:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:33):**  I have a dear friend that does a lot of work using large top lit updraft stoves.  
**[0:59:43-0:59:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:43):**  So it's not a retort, but it's a flame propagation and you drive off the volatiles and he is  
**[0:59:50-0:59:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:50):**  just now, he's never submitted his biochar for any of this testing.  
**[0:59:56-1:00:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:56):**  He has excellent biochar, but just to see for himself, he's going to start submitting  
**[1:00:03-1:00:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:03):**  this.  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:04):**  I know flame cap kilns, especially the cone kilns, which are contiki, the contiki kiln  
**[1:00:11-1:00:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:11):**  is a premier flame cap kiln.  
**[1:00:17-1:00:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:17):**  That's what it is.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:18):**  It's a cone kiln and there's been a lot of research and it's sent in and it has excellent  
**[1:00:25-1:00:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:25):**  properties.  
**[1:00:27-1:00:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:27):**  I like to say it's a function of the feedstock and the operator.  
**[1:00:38-1:00:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:38):**  So if you have someone that, if you've got a feedstock, how dry is your feedstock?  
**[1:00:45-1:00:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:45):**  And this also goes into how much smoke one creates.  
**[1:00:49-1:00:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:49):**  So if you have a drain in the area where I live, we're lucky even at the end of the summer  
**[1:00:56-1:01:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:56):**  to end up with feedstock that maybe has a 15% moisture content.  
**[1:01:01-1:01:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:01):**  We're lucky if we get that low.  
**[1:01:05-1:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:05):**  Flame cap kilns are forgiving in that you can burn, you can you pyrolyze feedstock that  
**[1:01:15-1:01:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:15):**  has a higher moisture content.  
**[1:01:17-1:01:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:17):**  It will take longer.  
**[1:01:19-1:01:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:19):**  It may smoke a little, but most of the smoke that's coming off is the gas, the water being  
**[1:01:27-1:01:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:27):**  put off.  
**[1:01:28-1:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:28):**  And you can tell there's been some interesting, just by visually, of how do you put it in,  
**[1:01:36-1:01:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:36):**  the color of the flame.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:39):**  Are you producing a lot of methane or little methane?  
**[1:01:44-1:01:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:44):**  And I'm sure you've seen in yourself the different colors of your flame when you add material  
**[1:01:51-1:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:51):**  versus when it's just, it's just pyrolyzing almost completely.  
**[1:01:58-1:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:58):**  So you will end up with different results depending on what one uses.  
**[1:02:08-1:02:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:08):**  But I'll go back to what I said early on.  
**[1:02:11-1:02:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:11):**  It's biochar and don't let perfection get in the way of putting, producing and or putting  
**[1:02:18-1:02:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:18):**  biochar in the ground.  
**[1:02:21-1:02:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:21):**  Do you think using too small of feedstock results in more ash because it just burns  
**[1:02:28-1:02:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:28):**  too quickly?  
**[1:02:29-1:02:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:29):**  Say you use rice hulls or even cow manure, I'm curious on.  
**[1:02:36-1:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:36):**  So you have herbaceous material there that you're burning.  
**[1:02:42-1:02:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:42):**  Does the ash to char ratio get too high?  
**[1:02:46-1:02:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:46):**  Well, it can get to, again, it's the operator and it's what one's using.  
**[1:02:52-1:02:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:52):**  There are, there are some of these top lit updraft stoves.  
**[1:02:56-1:03:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:56):**  If one were to look at rice hull gasifiers, there's work in the Philippines with one gentleman,  
**[1:03:04-1:03:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:04):**  Paul Bellino, Dr. Bellonio, that has done, I mean, they use rice gas, rice husk gasifiers  
**[1:03:14-1:03:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:14):**  commercially in bread making plants and it burned, they burned very efficiently.  
**[1:03:21-1:03:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:21):**  And it's the function of the stove and the operator of don't let it pyrolyze to ash.  
**[1:03:28-1:03:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:28):**  When I use in my little gasifier stoves, when I go out and do workshops, I'll use wood pellets  
**[1:03:35-1:03:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:35):**  just because they're uniform and I get a really good burn.  
**[1:03:38-1:03:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:38):**  And it's very small stove that's 27 ounces.  
**[1:03:43-1:03:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:43):**  It's one that's made out of soup cans and tomato cans.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  And it's knowing what the fire is doing.  
**[1:03:53-1:03:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:53):**  Once that fire dies down and it'll start to smoke, I quench and I put it out.  
**[1:03:58-1:03:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:58):**  Then I get no ash.  
**[1:03:59-1:04:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:59):**  If I would just to leave it, it's like a charcoal barbecue.  
**[1:04:04-1:04:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:04):**  All the charcoal that's left will turn to ash.  
**[1:04:10-1:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:10):**  So yes, would depend the feedstock, the rate of application and how one, one pulls out  
**[1:04:18-1:04:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:18):**  the feedstock when one stops and one stops the burn and puts in other material, puts  
**[1:04:25-1:04:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:25):**  in new material, one will create more ash.  
**[1:04:29-1:04:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:29):**  And yes, a more straw will create more of an ash.  
**[1:04:34-1:04:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:34):**  Straw would also create a lower carbon content.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:37):**  Straw will be a less recalcitrant.  
**[1:04:39-1:04:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:39):**  It won't be as long-lived.  
**[1:04:42-1:04:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:42):**  So it depends on the feedstock does affect the properties of the biochar that is created.  
**[1:04:52-1:04:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:52):**  I know this might be tough without visuals, but let's say you were at a workshop and giving  
**[1:04:58-1:05:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:58):**  people tips on being a good operator.  
**[1:05:03-1:05:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:03):**  What are some things you really want to watch for when you're feeding feedstock into, let's  
**[1:05:09-1:05:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:09):**  just use a cone kiln for example.  
**[1:05:11-1:05:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:11):**  Well, a cone kiln, there's a couple of ways of how one starts a cone kiln.  
**[1:05:17-1:05:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:17):**  One can either fill it all up and start it on top and let it burn down.  
**[1:05:22-1:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:22):**  I prefer where you start a little fire in the bottom and start adding material.  
**[1:05:31-1:05:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:31):**  And so as that material one looks, you get your little, you go like any fire, you get  
**[1:05:36-1:05:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:36):**  started with smaller material, with kindling and you come to bigger.  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:40):**  Say your fire is going now.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:43):**  By visually you look at that fire, when it looks as though you can see that the flames  
**[1:05:49-1:05:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:49):**  have died down.  
**[1:05:51-1:05:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:51):**  It's like a charcoal barbecue burning now.  
**[1:05:55-1:05:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:55):**  And then you start to see ash forming.  
**[1:05:57-1:06:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:57):**  Add your next layer.  
**[1:06:01-1:06:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:01):**  You will then get some smoke come off and you'll get more flame because that heat from  
**[1:06:08-1:06:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:08):**  below is what is driving out the volatile gases in the material you've just added.  
**[1:06:16-1:06:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:16):**  And because of the design, as you know, of a cone kiln, there's no air coming in from  
**[1:06:21-1:06:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:21):**  below.  
**[1:06:22-1:06:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:22):**  The only air comes over the top.  
**[1:06:25-1:06:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:25):**  So you're creating that oxygen starved environment.  
**[1:06:30-1:06:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:30):**  And when you look at it, you'll see that the flames are not on the material.  
**[1:06:37-1:06:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:37):**  The flame is actually above the material.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:39):**  The flame, and as you come up, the flame is actually at the top of your cone because that's  
**[1:06:45-1:06:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:45):**  where the gases rise.  
**[1:06:47-1:06:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:47):**  The oxygen that comes over the top mixes with the gases and ignites.  
**[1:06:53-1:06:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:53):**  Okay, so watch that flame go down.  
**[1:06:58-1:07:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:58):**  The flame comes down to the charcoal that's left, the biochar.  
**[1:07:04-1:07:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:04):**  Add your next layer and let it burn.  
**[1:07:08-1:07:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:08):**  And another rule of thumb is you add so that you fully burn everything, char everything,  
**[1:07:15-1:07:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  is that in the middle of your burn is where you add your larger materials.  
**[1:07:22-1:07:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:22):**  And if you have a large contiki kiln that's maybe four or five foot in diameter, you could  
**[1:07:30-1:07:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:30):**  be adding feedstock that's two, three inches in diameter in that middle of that burn.  
**[1:07:34-1:07:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:34):**  As you get towards the top, then start reducing the size again so that it gets fully pyrolyzed  
**[1:07:44-1:07:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:44):**  and fully turned to charcoal before you quench it.  
**[1:07:50-1:07:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:50):**  So it's the visual.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  And I'll give one example of, it's our relationship and it's the operator's relationship with  
**[1:07:59-1:08:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:59):**  the fire, with the stove, kiln, whatever they're using.  
**[1:08:06-1:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:06):**  I worked with a group called Sea Char with an art Donnelly and Sea Char built some toplet  
**[1:08:16-1:08:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:16):**  updraft stove tea luds out of five gallon pails that were, and he was using them in  
**[1:08:22-1:08:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:22):**  Costa Rica for migrant workers, farmers that were picking cacao beans and coffee beans.  
**[1:08:29-1:08:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:29):**  And this was going to be, and they were making biochar.  
**[1:08:34-1:08:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:34):**  So Art went down at one of his, we brought these down, he was working with an NGO down  
**[1:08:40-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:40):**  and he was an NGO and he pad the stove and he was demonstrating to the women because  
**[1:08:48-1:08:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:48):**  it's women that do the cooking in Costa Rica.  
**[1:08:52-1:08:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:52):**  And so it's been the thought that you can't add with a toplet, you put in your one load  
**[1:08:59-1:09:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:59):**  and you don't add any materials afterwards.  
**[1:09:03-1:09:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:03):**  Well, the cookers, the women that were using, operating these stoves are doing it.  
**[1:09:09-1:09:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:09):**  And then all of a sudden they kind of lifted the lid and they started to put more material  
**[1:09:13-1:09:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:13):**  in and Art was going to say, no, don't.  
**[1:09:16-1:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:16):**  And he just backed off and he let them do what they do, even though they were using  
**[1:09:23-1:09:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:23):**  a new stove.  
**[1:09:26-1:09:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:26):**  And Art said, they did things with that stove I did not think was possible.  
**[1:09:33-1:09:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:33):**  And what I learned that day is they have a relationship with fire that I will never have  
**[1:09:43-1:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:43):**  because they cook three meals a day over fire.  
**[1:09:47-1:09:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:47):**  And so whether it's, I'm sure from the very first burn you did with your comb kiln to  
**[1:09:53-1:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:53):**  where you are today, your relationship with fire is becoming more part of you.  
**[1:10:01-1:10:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  And so your experience of what you do it is, is, you know, practice.  
**[1:10:07-1:10:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:07):**  There's, it's practice, you know, it's practice makes perfect.  
**[1:10:11-1:10:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:11):**  Yeah, and it's, I think there's something within us that just has this intrinsic connection  
**[1:10:19-1:10:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:19):**  to fire.  
**[1:10:20-1:10:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:20):**  It's hundreds of thousands in our DNA.  
**[1:10:24-1:10:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:24):**  And I think a lot of that gets lost now with people living in cities, you know, the closest  
**[1:10:29-1:10:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:29):**  you might come to a fire is lighting a candle these days or, you know, striking a lighter.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:35):**  And when, when you start a fire, there is just something romantic.  
**[1:10:40-1:10:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:40):**  It just feels cool.  
**[1:10:41-1:10:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:41):**  Like my Saturday morning ritual, I try to every weekend as I get up before the sun is  
**[1:10:46-1:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:46):**  up and I start that kiln now and I go have a fire and it's, I look at it like, okay,  
**[1:10:52-1:10:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:52):**  when I'm making bio chart, sure.  
**[1:10:54-1:10:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:54):**  It might help the soil.  
**[1:10:55-1:10:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:55):**  If it does great, I don't think there's a negative as I discussed before, but a big  
**[1:10:59-1:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:59):**  part of the making it for me is like, it's fun for me and kind of relaxing to step away  
**[1:11:04-1:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:04):**  from the screens, to just make a fire, to manage the fire.  
**[1:11:09-1:11:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:09):**  And if that's all the benefit I got out of it and I'm just left with this char afterwards,  
**[1:11:14-1:11:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:14):**  like for me, that's enough.  
**[1:11:16-1:11:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:16):**  I realize that isn't everybody, but I think there are some special experiences.  
**[1:11:20-1:11:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:20):**  Like you said, when you do this a few times, fires are addicting.  
**[1:11:26-1:11:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:26):**  And I don't mean in a, in a pyromaniac lighting buildings on fire type of way, but in this  
**[1:11:32-1:11:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:32):**  kind of soulful way, there is something about burning that fire and looking into that fire  
**[1:11:38-1:11:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:38):**  that just, there's a lot of mystery there.  
**[1:11:40-1:11:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:40):**  You know, there's a lot of us in there.  
**[1:11:41-1:11:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:41):**  I, I, I have to agree with you completely with that and this personal experience.  
**[1:11:47-1:11:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:47):**  I mean, you know, we're doing this right in the middle of this whole COVID lockdown and  
**[1:11:52-1:11:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:52):**  everything else.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  In the beginning of it, there's a friend who has a large Kon-Tiki kiln that's a few miles  
**[1:11:58-1:12:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:58):**  away and I was going to do a workshop and he was going to bring his kiln back in.  
**[1:12:03-1:12:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:03):**  It was on March 7th, I believe.  
**[1:12:05-1:12:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:05):**  And we, we had to postpone.  
**[1:12:07-1:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:07):**  I chose, didn't have to, I chose to postpone that workshop.  
**[1:12:12-1:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:12):**  Well, a few weeks later, later in March, maybe in April, he got in touch with me and he said,  
**[1:12:22-1:12:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:22):**  his name is Leon, Leon said, you know, I'm not on my property and I'm going to do a burn.  
**[1:12:27-1:12:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:27):**  I'm going to do my kiln.  
**[1:12:28-1:12:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:28):**  He said, do you want to get out here?  
**[1:12:30-1:12:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:30):**  You want to, you want to come on out?  
**[1:12:32-1:12:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:32):**  And I says, I need to get out.  
**[1:12:34-1:12:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:34):**  Yes.  
**[1:12:35-1:12:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:35):**  And we went out and he was using very wet material that he had, but he had started,  
**[1:12:41-1:12:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:41):**  I mean, I went out mid, mid morning.  
**[1:12:43-1:12:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:43):**  He had already started early in the morning and he burned hours after I left and I was  
**[1:12:48-1:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:48):**  out there for about four or five hours.  
**[1:12:51-1:13:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:51):**  And it's that whole just being with it and talking and, and, and that, that relationship.  
**[1:13:00-1:13:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:00):**  And the other gentleman that I talked about just recently that I've known for years that  
**[1:13:05-1:13:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:05):**  works with bio chart lives about 30 miles from here.  
**[1:13:09-1:13:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  We just contacted each other recently.  
**[1:13:10-1:13:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:10):**  He says, you know, I've got this 21 year old mentee that is really into things that we're  
**[1:13:15-1:13:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:15):**  going to do in a bunch of burns and maybe you ought to get over.  
**[1:13:17-1:13:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:17):**  And my response to his, let me know when I could use a few hours of just hanging with  
**[1:13:24-1:13:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:24):**  you and your young mentee being with the fires.  
**[1:13:32-1:13:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:32):**  It's not for everybody.  
**[1:13:34-1:13:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:34):**  However, I mean, I don't know a person who doesn't like standing around a campfire.  
**[1:13:39-1:13:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:39):**  And if you're using a flame cap kiln, it's a campfire that's producing a lot less smoke  
**[1:13:45-1:13:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:45):**  than a campfire.  
**[1:13:46-1:13:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:46):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:47-1:13:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  And if you do it when it's cold, all the better because now you're warm.  
**[1:13:50-1:13:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:50):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:51-1:13:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:51):**  Yeah.  
**[1:13:52-1:13:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:52):**  It is a cool kind of Zen experience.  
**[1:13:54-1:13:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:54):**  And the other thing I like about it is in today's day and age, it feels like we get  
**[1:13:58-1:14:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:58):**  on this treadmill of work of always doing the next thing.  
**[1:14:01-1:14:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:01):**  It's a process.  
**[1:14:02-1:14:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:02):**  You start the fire, you finish it.  
**[1:14:04-1:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:04):**  So you can, within a few hours, you get the enjoyment, but you did something and you see  
**[1:14:08-1:14:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:08):**  the result right away.  
**[1:14:09-1:14:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:09):**  It's tangible.  
**[1:14:10-1:14:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:10):**  Hey man, I made something I can use like making a loaf of bread or something like that.  
**[1:14:15-1:14:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:15):**  So it is a cool experience.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  Along the tips that you had, I think one thing I had to learn was just what you said is instead  
**[1:14:23-1:14:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:23):**  of piling up the biomass, you're kind of layering it on like pancakes, stacking pancakes, slowly  
**[1:14:29-1:14:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:29):**  going up, creating uniform surface.  
**[1:14:33-1:14:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:33):**  And that way you get that more even burn.  
**[1:14:34-1:14:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:34):**  Like you said, once you just see that outer white coloring on, bam, next layer goes on.  
**[1:14:39-1:14:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:39):**  And with the cone kiln, I don't see any smoke.  
**[1:14:41-1:14:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:41):**  In fact, if you watch kind of even around the edges, you see these little vortices where  
**[1:14:47-1:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:47):**  the fire is drawing in the gas or anything trying to leak out the sides.  
**[1:14:53-1:14:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:53):**  If there's no wind, you'll see it actually curl back in where it's reburning it and just  
**[1:14:58-1:14:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:58):**  cycling it off.  
**[1:14:59-1:15:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:59):**  So it's a very clean, clean burn.  
**[1:15:02-1:15:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  It's a very clean burn.  
**[1:15:04-1:15:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:04):**  And then one thing that you alluded to and it's that it's very Zen.  
**[1:15:11-1:15:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:11):**  What I'm doing, especially if I'm working with a flame cap kiln, a cone kiln, I have  
**[1:15:17-1:15:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:17):**  to be present.  
**[1:15:20-1:15:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:20):**  I have to be mindful of what I'm doing.  
**[1:15:23-1:15:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:23):**  I don't have to be, but the fire will show me that I'm not being present because I'm  
**[1:15:28-1:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:28):**  off doing something else.  
**[1:15:29-1:15:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:29):**  I come back and I got a bunch of ash or I put too much on and I have a bunch of smoke.  
**[1:15:36-1:15:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:36):**  And so backing away from being in the screen or being locked up on the screen or being  
**[1:15:43-1:15:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:43):**  locked up, of coming to that moment of Zen, that moment of mindfulness, of being present  
**[1:15:50-1:15:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:50):**  with something.  
**[1:15:52-1:15:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:52):**  It's like it really does.  
**[1:15:58-1:16:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:58):**  It nurtures me and I know it nurtures other people.  
**[1:16:03-1:16:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:03):**  And when I do workshops and stuff, the workshops where we can do actually do a burn and that's  
**[1:16:13-1:16:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:13):**  the ones where the one where people really get off.  
**[1:16:16-1:16:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:16):**  And that's where the real learning happens and the real discussion happens.  
**[1:16:20-1:16:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:20):**  Because when I'm standing there with a PowerPoint and explaining and whatnot, it's almost like  
**[1:16:26-1:16:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:26):**  teaching to a class.  
**[1:16:27-1:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:27):**  Yeah, there are a few people that ask questions, but when you're standing around a flame cap  
**[1:16:34-1:16:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:34):**  kiln, a large burner, that's where the learning happens.  
**[1:16:40-1:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:40):**  That's where everyone you'll notice there's maybe if there are 12 people there, you'll  
**[1:16:44-1:16:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:44):**  have three different conversations going on at the same time and everyone getting something.  
**[1:16:52-1:16:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:52):**  So yeah, I agree.  
**[1:16:54-1:16:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:54):**  Everybody looking to start this at home and they don't have a kiln, they don't want to  
**[1:16:59-1:17:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:59):**  fabricate one because they're not sure if they want to get into it.  
**[1:17:01-1:17:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:01):**  Do you think they can get good results out of just digging that cone out of the ground  
**[1:17:06-1:17:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:06):**  and doing the burn in that cone?  
**[1:17:08-1:17:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:08):**  Yes, they can.  
**[1:17:09-1:17:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:09):**  Yeah, they can.  
**[1:17:11-1:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:11):**  And there are some excellent YouTube videos.  
**[1:17:17-1:17:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:17):**  Josiah Hunt has done them in Hawaii, he shows that.  
**[1:17:22-1:17:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:22):**  But they're all out of, again, search YouTube and yes, one can and one will and there are  
**[1:17:29-1:17:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:29):**  certain different ways that one can quench it of just pouring water on it.  
**[1:17:33-1:17:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:33):**  But start off with a small, it doesn't have to be a six foot diameter.  
**[1:17:37-1:17:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:37):**  Start off something that's maybe 24 inches deep and 24 inches in diameter, 24 inches  
**[1:17:44-1:17:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:44):**  deep in a cone shape and play with it.  
**[1:17:51-1:17:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:51):**  And if nothing else, I mean, you can just cover it up with the dirt that you pulled  
**[1:17:55-1:18:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:55):**  out and leave the biochar there because you can quench it with soil.  
**[1:18:01-1:18:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:01):**  And there are the minerals that the biochar pulls from the soil.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:08):**  There's an activation process that all happens.  
**[1:18:10-1:18:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:10):**  So when sometimes, oftentimes when they're using these large, doing these large burns  
**[1:18:15-1:18:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:15):**  in ground, they won't use water to quench it, they will actually mount dirt over it.  
**[1:18:23-1:18:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:23):**  And then when you excavate the biochar, you've mixed in, you've got some soil, some minerals  
**[1:18:27-1:18:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:27):**  already mixed in.  
**[1:18:28-1:18:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:28):**  So you've started the process of charging your biochar.  
**[1:18:33-1:18:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33):**  The quench is an important part of the process.  
**[1:18:37-1:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:37):**  So let's say you get to the end, your cone is full.  
**[1:18:40-1:18:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:40):**  You're seeing that white and ash layer form on the top.  
**[1:18:44-1:18:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:44):**  It looks like everything is burned.  
**[1:18:46-1:18:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:46):**  I want to now put it out.  
**[1:18:50-1:18:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:50):**  If you're using water, how do you go about that?  
**[1:18:53-1:19:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:53):**  And what else is the water doing besides just extinguishing the fire?  
**[1:19:00-1:19:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:00):**  There are a couple of things the water is doing.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:02):**  First of all, there are two ways of doing it.  
**[1:19:04-1:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:04):**  Does one want to pour the water into their kiln?  
**[1:19:07-1:19:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:07):**  Well, one wants to dump the biochar out, depending on the size of the kiln, depending on where  
**[1:19:15-1:19:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:15):**  you're doing it, on a layer that's not going to burn maybe a piece of metal or something,  
**[1:19:21-1:19:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:21):**  or even on the ground, but you will burn any grasses or stuff you might have there and  
**[1:19:26-1:19:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:26):**  then quench it on the ground.  
**[1:19:29-1:19:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:29):**  The reason I say doing that is because if you do it in your kiln, it will shorten the  
**[1:19:33-1:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:33):**  life of your kiln because of the oxidation of the hot metals getting hit with steam and  
**[1:19:42-1:19:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:42):**  water.  
**[1:19:47-1:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:47):**  It starts the charging process.  
**[1:19:50-1:19:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:50):**  It opens up the pores.  
**[1:19:52-1:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:52):**  It starts to create the film around on the outer layer biochar because biochar does  
**[1:19:59-1:20:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:59):**  have this film, which captures where the nutrients and where it's mined, it's not in the biochar,  
**[1:20:12-1:20:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:12):**  but it's actually encased around a film on the biochar.  
**[1:20:18-1:20:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:18):**  And so using a water quenching does do that.  
**[1:20:22-1:20:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:22):**  And I will sometimes water quench, oftentimes when I'm out doing demonstrations in small  
**[1:20:28-1:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:28):**  top lid updraft stoves, I just have a larger container like an old popcorn can that I will  
**[1:20:39-1:20:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:39):**  dump the biochar and put the lid on.  
**[1:20:41-1:20:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:41):**  There's no air and I end up with dry charcoal, dry biochar.  
**[1:20:47-1:20:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:47):**  But it does need to be put water on it at some time because biochar is hydrophobic when  
**[1:20:56-1:20:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:56):**  you begin with it and it will actually float.  
**[1:20:59-1:21:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:59):**  It needs to be sit with water for a while because it will absorb quite a bit of water.  
**[1:21:05-1:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:05):**  And when one quenches your biochar with water, you've started the process of getting some  
**[1:21:14-1:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:14):**  moisture into the biochar.  
**[1:21:16-1:21:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:16):**  Let's say now you've quenched, the biochar is now sitting in the kiln.  
**[1:21:21-1:21:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:21):**  What's your preferred method or next step at that point?  
**[1:21:23-1:21:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:23):**  Do you go to reduce particle size at that point or are you looking to charge it at that  
**[1:21:27-1:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:27):**  point?  
**[1:21:28-1:21:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:28):**  Depending on what you've used, it's using some larger flame cap kilns.  
**[1:21:38-1:21:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:38):**  If you've got chunks that are three inches in diameter, I'd want to break those up a  
**[1:21:43-1:21:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:43):**  little.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:44):**  But if you're using small material, you can go right to charging it.  
**[1:21:54-1:21:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:54):**  A simple way, depending on how much you've created, when I've done it workshops with  
**[1:21:58-1:22:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:58):**  people that have used large repurposed fuel oil barrels that were five and a half feet  
**[1:22:05-1:22:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:05):**  in diameter, standing five and a half feet tall instead of buying a large flame cap kiln.  
**[1:22:12-1:22:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:12):**  I know several farmers that are doing that, using material like that.  
**[1:22:17-1:22:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:17):**  And you'll end up with large pieces of material.  
**[1:22:21-1:22:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:21):**  And one of the simplest ways of breaking up that material is when you dump it on the ground,

**[1:22:33-1:22:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:33):**  it'll break up those pieces and then charge it.  
**[1:22:36-1:22:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:36):**  I've seen people that have put this material inside like two piece, two tarps and then  
**[1:22:42-1:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:42):**  put one tarp on the ground, one tarp on top, run over with the tractor, pull that tarp  
**[1:22:48-1:22:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:48):**  off.  
**[1:22:49-1:22:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:49):**  You've broken it down a little bit.  
**[1:22:50-1:22:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:50):**  And then on that tarp, they've actually charged it on the tarp where they've added moisture,  
**[1:22:57-1:23:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:57):**  maybe added in this case where we were on an island and they took five, 10 gallons of  
**[1:23:02-1:23:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:02):**  seawater, the minerals from the seawater, put that on the chart, some beneficial microbes  
**[1:23:09-1:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:09):**  and whatever they add in their mix, worm castings, and then just folded, covered it up, let it  
**[1:23:17-1:23:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:17):**  sit for about four or five days and then put it into their garden.  
**[1:23:21-1:23:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:21):**  In addition to soil building benefits, what are some of the other potential uses for biochar?  
**[1:23:27-1:23:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:27):**  I think you were involved in a project that involved landscape remediation involving some  
**[1:23:32-1:23:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:32):**  sort of pollutants using biochar?  
**[1:23:35-1:23:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:35):**  The first project, first commercial project I did with this biochar was at the, as I said,  
**[1:23:44-1:23:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:44):**  I think I believe I mentioned, I get the biochar that I use from a paper mill from their steam  
**[1:23:50-1:23:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:50):**  boiler and it is not part of the paper making process.  
**[1:23:55-1:23:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:55):**  It's not a byproduct of that.  
**[1:23:58-1:24:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:58):**  So this boiler makes steam for the paper making process because they use a lot of steam, they  
**[1:24:05-1:24:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:05):**  use a lot of heat.  
**[1:24:09-1:24:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:09):**  In where I live, it's a seaport town, there is a port.  
**[1:24:13-1:24:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:13):**  The port of Port Townsend is under regulations from the Department of Ecology, Washington  
**[1:24:18-1:24:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:18):**  State Department of Ecology for the discharge.  
**[1:24:22-1:24:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:22):**  They are monitored at the amount of zinc and copper that they discharge to the bay.  
**[1:24:29-1:24:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:29):**  And zinc and copper, when I was working at the Environmental Compliance Office I worked  
**[1:24:36-1:24:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:36):**  with, it was interesting but a lot of people thought it was from the bottom scraping of  
**[1:24:42-1:24:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:42):**  boats because they work on boats in the shipyard.  
**[1:24:47-1:24:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:47):**  And it turned out that the majority of the zinc and copper came from metal roofs and  
**[1:24:55-1:25:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:55):**  the biggest contributor of zinc and copper was from chain link fence.  
**[1:25:04-1:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:04):**  Because anything that's galvanized contains, that is the galvanization process.  
**[1:25:10-1:25:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:10):**  So it's that zinc and copper.  
**[1:25:12-1:25:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:12):**  So what we did was identifying what the sources were, the big sources that we went after were  
**[1:25:18-1:25:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:18):**  the runoff from their corrugated metal roofs.  
**[1:25:23-1:25:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:23):**  And so we made these downspout filters out of biochar and used a couple of different  
**[1:25:29-1:25:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:29):**  blends, some of them with 80% biochar and 20% little peak pellets and other was just  
**[1:25:35-1:25:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:35):**  pure biochar.  
**[1:25:37-1:25:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:37):**  And with either one of the filters that we used, we were able to remove, take in some  
**[1:25:44-1:25:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:44):**  cases over 5,000 parts per billion zinc and reduce it to less than 10.  
**[1:25:56-1:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:56):**  And which brought them, and they were allowed to discharge something about 100, 160 depending  
**[1:26:02-1:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:02):**  on whether it's zinc or copper, to their waters.  
**[1:26:05-1:26:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:05):**  Well, we were able to put in these simple filters that were made out of recycled, they're  
**[1:26:11-1:26:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:11):**  called IBC coats, international container.  
**[1:26:14-1:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:14):**  They're the ones where syrups would come in and different liquids come in.  
**[1:26:22-1:26:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:22):**  You've seen them, the metal cages with a plastic liner.  
**[1:26:29-1:26:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:29):**  That's what we repurposed and used.  
**[1:26:33-1:26:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:33):**  And having one cubic yard of biochar in this filter, we were able to remove from about  
**[1:26:43-1:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:43):**  it from up in some cases 8,000 square foot metal roof, all the stormwater runoff, all  
**[1:26:49-1:26:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:49):**  the rainwater runoff to bring that roof into compliance.  
**[1:26:54-1:27:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:54):**  And not using, using point of source remediation, not putting it all on the soil, on the ground,  
**[1:27:05-1:27:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:05):**  and then having a big treatment facility, which is a typical engineering way of doing  
**[1:27:10-1:27:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:10):**  it.  
**[1:27:11-1:27:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:11):**  And as an engineer, that's the way we did it.  
**[1:27:13-1:27:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:13):**  But doing it as a point of source made for a simpler solution to remove their contaminations.  
**[1:27:20-1:27:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:20):**  So that's a project that I've done.  
**[1:27:23-1:27:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:23):**  They use it, it has been used in Colorado for mine reclamation, restoring the land.  
**[1:27:30-1:27:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:30):**  It's used in rain gardens.  
**[1:27:32-1:27:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:32):**  So again, stormwater, not water, but this, it is stormwater runoff from roads or from  
**[1:27:39-1:27:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:39):**  roofs.  
**[1:27:40-1:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:40):**  Rain gardens that are typically mixed with compost and some wood chips.  
**[1:27:45-1:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:45):**  If you put in some biochar in with that mix, it will remove the hydrocarbons and zinc because  
**[1:27:53-1:28:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:53):**  many people do not realize, but I believe, I may be off on a number, but 10% of automobile  
**[1:28:00-1:28:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:00):**  breaks are zinc.  
**[1:28:02-1:28:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:02):**  So every time you step on your break, you're putting zinc on a pavement.  
**[1:28:06-1:28:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:06):**  And when it rains, that zinc, if you're close to a water source, ends up in the water and  
**[1:28:11-1:28:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:11):**  the zinc really affects the fish.  
**[1:28:14-1:28:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:14):**  So yeah, it's got, and there are more and more, I'm also doing a project.  
**[1:28:19-1:28:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:19):**  This is a soil.  
**[1:28:21-1:28:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:21):**  We're getting ready to do a project with the city here that they compost all their biosolids  
**[1:28:28-1:28:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:28):**  from their wastewater treatment plant and co-composting with the biochar because the  
**[1:28:37-1:28:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:37):**  compost enhances the composting process and then measure different things in the finished  
**[1:28:44-1:28:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:44):**  compost afterwards.  
**[1:28:45-1:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:45):**  And there is a lot of work happening with that right now in California because California  
**[1:28:52-1:28:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:52):**  is diverting all their food waste from your waste stream and it has to be composted.  
**[1:28:57-1:29:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:57):**  They can't end up in your trash.  
**[1:29:00-1:29:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:00):**  So there are a lot of different things.  
**[1:29:03-1:29:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:03):**  I'm working one project that tomorrow they're picking up some biochar.  
**[1:29:07-1:29:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:07):**  It's someone that has anaerobic digesters, a plant here in a company here in Seattle area,  
**[1:29:16-1:29:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:16):**  and they want to remove the smell from the process and they're going to be running it  
**[1:29:21-1:29:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:21):**  through a biochar filter because biochar activated carbon filters.  
**[1:29:29-1:29:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:29):**  Some people you can buy a composter that you put or where you can collect your compost  
**[1:29:35-1:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:35):**  in your kitchen and it has a charcoal filter.  
**[1:29:39-1:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:39):**  Well personally I throw biochar in my pail under my seat, which is a three gallon pail.  
**[1:29:47-1:29:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:47):**  It never smells anymore.  
**[1:29:49-1:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:49):**  It absorbs the smell.  
**[1:29:52-1:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:52):**  So is biochar activated carbon same thing or maybe not the exact same thing, but are  
**[1:29:58-1:30:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:58):**  they perform the same?  
**[1:30:01-1:30:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:01):**  They can perform in similar manners.  
**[1:30:04-1:30:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:04):**  Yes, activated carbon is put under a certain pressure and is treated in a different way.  
**[1:30:11-1:30:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:11):**  Whereas biochar, you get what you get when you do it, but there are people that are working  
**[1:30:15-1:30:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:15):**  what they call designer biochars and then post treating the biochars and making them  
**[1:30:23-1:30:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:23):**  into more of an activated charcoal, but they do have many of the same properties.  
**[1:30:29-1:30:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:29):**  In that point of source filtration project, were they able to test that biochar and see  
**[1:30:34-1:30:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:34):**  that those heavy metals were getting caught up in the char?  
**[1:30:39-1:30:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:39):**  Well we have not tested them, tested the actual biochar that's left in there, but we do know,  
**[1:30:47-1:30:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:47):**  so if you're pulling in 5,000 parts per million of zinc and you're discharging less than 10,  
**[1:30:58-1:31:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:58):**  so say just for numbers 5,000 going in and 50 going out, so 4,950 parts per million didn't  
**[1:31:07-1:31:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:07):**  just disappear.  
**[1:31:09-1:31:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:09):**  It's been absorbed to the surface of the biochar through that negative charging that the biochar  
**[1:31:18-1:31:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:18):**  has.  
**[1:31:19-1:31:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:19):**  Now, it's in a water bath.  
**[1:31:22-1:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:22):**  That water bath is there all the time and there was one researcher, Hugh McLaughlin,  
**[1:31:28-1:31:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:28):**  who I sent him pictures and we were talking about it and he asked me, he says, well in  
**[1:31:35-1:31:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:35):**  that bath is there any slime or is there any algae?  
**[1:31:41-1:31:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:41):**  And I said, oh yeah.  
**[1:31:43-1:31:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:43):**  He said, well, because the question was how long will the biochar last in these filters?  
**[1:31:48-1:31:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:48):**  And he said it's possible that they might last for an indefinite period of time because  
**[1:31:57-1:32:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:57):**  depending upon what that algae that's in there, that algae could be feeding on the zinc and  
**[1:32:05-1:32:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:05):**  transmuting it because mycelia will do different things.  
**[1:32:10-1:32:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:10):**  Mushrooms will remediate in different ways.  
**[1:32:12-1:32:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:12):**  I don't know.  
**[1:32:14-1:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:14):**  We did not test it.  
**[1:32:16-1:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:16):**  One of the gentlemen that I worked with in building these, what his thought was, which  
**[1:32:20-1:32:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:20):**  I would have loved to see this happen, when they, he used to work in, when corrugated  
**[1:32:31-1:32:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:31):**  metal is made, is made when the roof galvanizing is made, they put a charge on a sheet of metal  
**[1:32:42-1:32:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:42):**  and then the zinc is pulled from the solution and bound to the metal.  
**[1:32:52-1:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:52):**  And he had worked in that process.  
**[1:32:54-1:33:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:54):**  He said, what if we put in a sheet and change the polarities, can we then put in enough  
**[1:33:05-1:33:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:05):**  of a charge to break the bond from what's on the biochar, the zinc on the biochar and  
**[1:33:13-1:33:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:13):**  pull it off the biochar and put it on a metal plate?  
**[1:33:17-1:33:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:17):**  Right.  
**[1:33:18-1:33:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:18):**  And that was something that I think is, further research is worth doing because then one could  
**[1:33:24-1:33:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:24):**  recycle zinc.  
**[1:33:26-1:33:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:26):**  One could then also, your biochar that's in these filters, these type of filters, would  
**[1:33:32-1:33:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:32):**  last indefinitely.  
**[1:33:34-1:33:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:34):**  So I don't know.  
**[1:33:36-1:33:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:36):**  So the analogy to the soil here is it's holding pollutants coming off a roof.  
**[1:33:43-1:33:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:43):**  You put it into soil, it could hold stuff in the soil, good things, bad things, and  
**[1:33:48-1:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:48):**  it's locking them up in place.  
**[1:33:51-1:33:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:51):**  So the biology, be it bacteria, be it fungi, whatever, now has a chance to access that  
**[1:33:59-1:34:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:59):**  versus before where it may have wanted to just flow to a lower level of the soil.  
**[1:34:04-1:34:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:04):**  So you're holding stuff there and then you're allowing the biology to go in and do whatever  
**[1:34:11-1:34:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:11):**  it does with that stuff.  
**[1:34:13-1:34:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:13):**  Exactly.  
**[1:34:14-1:34:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:14):**  Well, I mean, this has been great.  
**[1:34:18-1:34:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:18):**  I think it's filled in a lot of the gaps that I had around biochar knowledge.  
**[1:34:22-1:34:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:22):**  For people out there listening to this and watching this, what's one takeaway you want  
**[1:34:27-1:34:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:27):**  them to have about biochar?  
**[1:34:32-1:34:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:32):**  It's not a mysterious element.  
**[1:34:36-1:34:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:36):**  It's something that if you like building little campfires like you do, go ahead and make some  
**[1:34:42-1:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:42):**  biochar.  
**[1:34:45-1:34:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:45):**  Start using it.  
**[1:34:47-1:34:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:47):**  Play with it.  
**[1:34:48-1:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:48):**  Have fun with it.  
**[1:34:50-1:34:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:50):**  And see what it does.  
**[1:34:56-1:34:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:56):**  It's not a mystery.  
**[1:34:58-1:35:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:58):**  It's something that our ancestors through the millennia have been using on different  
**[1:35:04-1:35:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:04):**  continents both in Northern Europe, Africa, South America, the Plains Indians, I mean,  
**[1:35:15-1:35:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:15):**  they burned and that burn was creating some biochar.  
**[1:35:19-1:35:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:19):**  It's something that's in our DNA and I think we've forgotten it.  
**[1:35:24-1:35:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:24):**  Well, it's been great, Francesco, for people that want to learn more about the work that  
**[1:35:30-1:35:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:30):**  you're doing, where's the best place to go?  
**[1:35:33-1:35:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:33):**  Well, I would say you can go to my website, which is OlympicBioChar.com.  
**[1:35:38-1:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:38):**  It's pretty minimalistic on that website.  
**[1:35:44-1:35:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:44):**  We will be putting up some links, but I would start with a few places.  
**[1:35:50-1:35:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:50):**  I would start with the International Biochar Initiative.  
**[1:35:55-1:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:55):**  Just search that.  
**[1:35:57-1:36:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:57):**  Look at the U.S. Biochar Initiative and from both those places, there are links to a myriad  
**[1:36:06-1:36:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:06):**  of information where one can go.  
**[1:36:12-1:36:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:12):**  As open as I am in talking with you today, if anyone reached out to me from my website,  
**[1:36:18-1:36:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:18):**  I have a resource sheet, simple sheet.  
**[1:36:22-1:36:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:22):**  There are great videos that are out there, some that I like, and I'd be happy to share  
**[1:36:28-1:36:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:28):**  it up with anyone.  
**[1:36:58-1:37:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-11-FrancescoTortorici-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:58):**  Thank you.

    ### In Search of Soil  (2021-08-25)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  Lactobacillus.  LAB.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:22):**  EM.  You've probably heard these terms mentioned a lot, or maybe you haven't.  They're all terms that deal with a specific consortium or group of microbes that can work  
**[0:00:36-0:00:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:36):**  together to benefit the soil.  EM is one of those mysterious, yet fairly well researched topics out there in the soil  world.  
**[0:00:47-0:00:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:47):**  And despite the amount of research and work that's been done in it, a lot of people don't  know about it, and there's a lot of misconceptions around it.  Well, today we're going to the microbial source, and I'm talking to Dr. Matthew Wood about  
**[0:01:02-0:01:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:02):**  EM.  Now, EM is a trademark term, and that's not a trademark his company owns, but for the  introduction, let's say we're talking about EM, but we're really talking about the microbes  
**[0:01:14-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:14):**  in EM.  And today, Dr. Wood's going to talk about why you might want to look at EM, what it's  capable of, and why it might be better than other forms of microbial inoculants, like  
**[0:01:27-0:01:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:27):**  homemade microbial cultures and compost teas.  Let's get into it.  It's all about microbes with Dr. Matthew Wood of SCD Probiotics.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:37):**  This is In Search of Soil.  All right, so if we go back to your early days of first studying microbes at University  of Missouri, why did you get into that field to begin with?  
**[0:01:49-0:02:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:49):**  Well, I got into it, originally I was into soil science, and I got interested in soil  science because I read a book called Empty Harvest by Bernard Jensen, which talks about  sort of a depletion of trace minerals in the soil and how it impacts quality of food, and  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:18):**  then therefore how it impacts human health.  So I was really interested in that connection between soil and agricultural practices and  the quality of the produce and human health.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:37):**  I went to study that subject at the University of Missouri, and I was a little disappointed  at the beginning because the curriculum and sort of the way of thinking was very chemical  dominated, which is typical of big land grant universities that are strong agricultural  
**[0:03:06-0:03:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:06):**  schools.  You know, the state of Missouri, we have the headquarters of Monsanto in St. Louis, so  of course they're a big contributor to the school.  
**[0:03:18-0:03:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:18):**  And just generally the way of thinking was this chemical approach, which is dominant  in agriculture.  Eventually you find yourself actually in Japan studying in Dr. Higa's lab.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:29):**  What was that experience like studying under him?  Oh, it was amazing.  He had a lab of about eight students, several international students, all doing Masters  
**[0:03:47-0:03:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:47):**  of Science in bioproduction.  And because of the international sort of, even back then, the international use and  work going on with these concepts that Dr. Higa originally put forth in his books, because  
**[0:04:16-0:04:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:16):**  it was happening all over the world, he was often invited.  And so I did a lot of traveling with him around the world and did some translation for some  of his meetings and presentations.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:33):**  And yeah, it was amazing.  He's incredible sort of visionary and scientist and understanding how to use microbes.  If you go back to those days studying under him in the lab, what were some things that  
**[0:04:49-0:04:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:49):**  you guys were working on that were showing really promising or outstanding results?  Some of the work that was most exciting at the time was, two subjects really that come  to mind.  
**[0:05:05-0:05:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:05):**  One was showing an effect or seeing an effect of increasing the overall diversity index  in a system, in a soil or in an agricultural ecosystem.  And a diversity index is like a way of measuring the amount of diversity and the level of activity  
**[0:05:35-0:05:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:35):**  of the biology in a system.  And so we saw very significant, it was like in the chemical system, you have this trend  over years, okay, these are long term trends, but in the chemical dominated system, you  
**[0:05:56-0:06:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:56):**  have this trend of reducing the diversity index over time.  So you have less diversity, you have less activity of the biology over time.  And with this tool of EM cultures, we saw back then that you can reverse that trend.  
**[0:06:26-0:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:26):**  So you can actually see and measure an increase in the diversity over time.  And to me, that's like really, really fundamental with what's happening around the world with  the ecosystems.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  So that was, yeah, that was made a big impression.  And then the other one was just seeing the nutrient levels.  So you know, in a plant's growth cycle, it needs certain nutrients at different times,  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:04):**  like it might need more nitrogen during the vegetative stage, for example.  And what we saw was that in the soils that had higher populations and activity of these  beneficial microbes that we were adding and that we were measuring with EM practices,  
**[0:07:39-0:07:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:39):**  eventually the plants create some sort of message.  What we saw was that the microbes would increase, for example, the nitrogen in the rhizosphere  around the roots at the time when the plant needed increased nitrogen.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:01):**  So we saw a clear communication happening between the plant and the microbial community  where they were symbiotic, they were both helping each other in some way.  And we saw that through NPK levels over the growth cycle in the plant as well as in the  
**[0:08:27-0:08:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:27):**  soil with different types of treatments.  So that was really impressive as well.  To set some terminology straight here, because I know this is where a lot of people get confused.  
**[0:08:41-0:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:41):**  EM, what is it?  So EM technically stands for efficient microbes.  That's the proper translation from Japanese.  
**[0:08:54-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:54):**  In Japanese, it's Yu-Yo Bi-Seibutsu, which basically means efficient microorganisms.  When Dr. Higa's book was translated, it was mistranslated to be effective microbes or  microorganisms.  
**[0:09:14-0:09:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:14):**  It's a small nuance, but efficient versus effective is quite different.  So yeah, efficient microbes is basically this concept of having cultures or using cultures  that have three main groups, the phototrophic bacteria, the yeast, and the lactic acid bacteria.  
**[0:09:42-0:09:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:42):**  Doesn't have only those groups, but those are kind of the three main groups.  And that's really the concept.  I mean, Dr. Higa came up with that concept.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:56):**  He actually started in the 70s working on it, and he figured out and had kind of the  first EM culture in like 80, 81, and started testing that in soils.  So yeah, EM is efficient microbes, and it's mainly a consortia culture of those groups,  
**[0:10:27-0:10:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:27):**  but not only those groups.  Now I would also say that there's an organization started by some of Dr. Higa's students,  a company based in Okinawa called EM Research Organization, and they have since trademarked  
**[0:10:46-0:10:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  EM and EM-1 as brands.  So our company, SCD Probiotics, we don't use EM terminology really anymore.  I mean, for me mentally, it's still kind of this concept rather than a specific brand  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:04):**  and product from a specific company.  But yeah, so now EM is more like a brand from a specific company.  And yeah, but that's sort of the origin of EM terminology.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:26):**  If we think about that concept, consortia, can you talk about that?  Because I think this is where some people get lost.  They might make a lactobacillus solution and say, well, I know this is trademarked now,  
**[0:11:43-0:11:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:43):**  but they say I've now made EM.  What are they missing?  Well they may have made EM.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:52):**  I mean, if it's only lactobacillus or lactic acid bacteria, then yeah, it's not EM by definition,  because it needs to have those different components.  I mean, I think in the literature, EM is pretty well defined to have those three groups.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:13):**  There can be different population levels, different strains, but sort of generically  speaking, if it's got all those groups, then you could call it an EM culture from my point  of view.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:28):**  A lot of when I do the reading on EM, the consortia concept promises or implies this,  the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  So if I just add LAB, if I add PNSB and I add yeast to the soil, or I have those minerals  
**[0:12:47-0:12:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:47):**  acting on their own, they would behave differently if I put them all together in one solution  and apply that.  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[0:13:01-0:13:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:01):**  I think you said it well when you talk about the sum is greater than the individual parts.  If you just throw the organisms together, mix them up, it doesn't really work.  It's not that simple.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:24):**  There is a culturing process where you, I mean, the way we do it, we actually create  a number of different consortia seeds cultures, and then those seed cultures get combined  into make a mother culture, but they don't all get combined at once.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:43):**  There's different stages of the fermentation and the development of it.  So I mean, the thing is that I've seen all this do it yourself stuff, including like  the methods out of Korea, where you ferment the rice in the woods, in the soil.  
**[0:14:06-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:06):**  The problem with all those is that they're just inconsistent and there's not really science.  You've got to have some basic microbiology and measure what's there and its stability,  including biochemical components.  
**[0:14:31-0:14:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:31):**  So it's very complex.  For a user, there are plenty of great cultures where you can just buy a mother culture to  do fermentation.  
**[0:14:50-0:14:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:50):**  So personally, I wouldn't recommend trying to recreate the wheel and make your own culture  and stuff like that.  It's not that simple and you'd have to have pretty sophisticated lab and equipment to  
**[0:15:07-0:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:07):**  be able to have any success with it.  It's part of the problem in the homades, whether it's the rice wash solution or rice in the  forest capturing those microbes is you don't know what you're getting.  
**[0:15:21-0:15:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:21):**  You could be breeding out good with bad.  Yeah, that is the problem.  It's not produced using quality control measures according to material specifications.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:40):**  So you don't know what you're getting.  And actually, similar with compost tea.  In fact, there's been some problems with compost tea because when you aerate, you can get really  
**[0:15:56-0:16:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:56):**  nasty microbes, pathogens growing.  And with the consortia culture, one of the attributes is the low pH.  And that low pH really inhibits the undesirable or the disease causing microbes to proliferate.  
**[0:16:22-0:16:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:22):**  So you're creating an EM solution in an anaerobic environment, lower the pH, and then you take  that and you add it to an environment that is closer to a neutral pH and aerobic.  How does that work at the end of the day?  
**[0:16:50-0:16:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:50):**  So, acidic, acidic, now applied to aerobic, neutral.  Do they survive?  What's happening in that transition?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:06):**  Well first of all, a little bit of technical terminology.  You've got anaerobic and aerobic microbes, but then you've also got facultative anaerobes  and facultative anaerobes.  
**[0:17:21-0:17:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:21):**  And the microbes in EM cultures are facultative.  So I don't know if I should be more technical on what those mean.  Okay, well first of all, it's not produced anaerobically.  
**[0:17:38-0:17:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:38):**  It's technically semi-anaerobic.  There's still oxygen present.  And the microbes are not obligate anaerobes.  
**[0:17:50-0:17:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50):**  Obligate anaerobes means that they are killed by the presence of oxygen.  Facultative anaerobes means that the presence of oxygen doesn't kill them.  It's just they prefer there not to be oxygen.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:06):**  They grow better in the absence of oxygen.  But they're not killed by oxygen.  So they're facultative anaerobes.  
**[0:18:17-0:18:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:17):**  Yeah and maybe that clears it up right there.  The other question about pH is, actually if you add, pH is one measure but then there's  also the acidity and how buffered it is.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:43):**  So if you add like an EM culture, like a mother culture, which is let's say a 3.5 pH at a  rate of 5%, so 5 parts mother culture and 95 parts neutral water at a 7.0 pH, you'll  see the pH of that water come down significantly.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  So maybe as low as 4.0 or 4.5.  So yeah.  But then aren't the microbes used to surviving then at that low pH but now I apply that even  
**[0:19:33-0:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:33):**  diluted down higher pH water solution to my soil and now it's getting diluted down infinitely  times more.  So they're existing now and those microbes are in the water and the soil matrix.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  Are they, if they were used to being in that acidic environment when they're cultured out,  how are they now surviving in a soil where if you just take a random soil sample it's  closer to neutral?  
**[0:20:03-0:20:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:03):**  Yeah I see your question.  So you mentioned that they prefer the lower pH but that's not actually true.  The low pH is created by their metabolites, their waste, the cell's waste.  
**[0:20:23-0:20:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:23):**  It's organic acids that lower the pH and when the pH gets low enough different strains of  microbes have different tolerance to pH but generally the lower you get the less tolerance  there is.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:38):**  So low pH will kill some amount of microbes and in particular it happens to kill pathogens  more than beneficials which is why you have like the low acid canned food laws where if  something is pickled and it's below 4.2 pH it's pretty well preserved.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:01):**  It's not going to be harboring pathogens and you can put it on the shelf and eat it six  months later and it's fine because of the pH.  So the FDA has a whole category called low acid canned food which is if the pH is below  
**[0:21:20-0:21:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:20):**  4.2, I think it's 4.2 pH then it's basically considered preserved and it's fine to have  a longer shelf life.  So it's kind of like with alcohol, making wine, fermenting, the yeast produces alcohol.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:39):**  When the alcohol concentration gets high enough it kills the yeast that produced it.  Same thing with lactic acid producing bacteria.  If that acid gets strong enough and depending on the strain it'll die or it'll reduce in  
**[0:21:57-0:21:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:57):**  population.  So the acidic environment is the byproduct of those microbes not the required condition  to have those microbes live.  
**[0:22:06-0:22:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:06):**  Correct.  So when you then apply them to a soil they can go on living because they weren't bred  to live in that acidic environment.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:17):**  Yes, but I also, I view it, you know, not as much about this particular strain is going  to go on to live in a certain population in the soil.  It's more about you're going to stimulate the biology in the soil so you're going to  
**[0:22:40-0:22:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:40):**  get an increase in beneficial organisms activity.  So you know it's like in our science and especially the chemical approach which is kind of how  we were all raised, it's actually kind of simple because you can break it down into  
**[0:23:05-0:23:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:05):**  very specific measured components.  Like the whole chemical industry and all the laws around it are designed for exactness.  And we run into this importing and exporting microbes and cultures all over the world in  
**[0:23:21-0:23:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:21):**  our business because the laws were set up to deal with chemicals not complex biology.  So even when we take that sort of paradigm and apply it to microbiology we like to isolate  an organism and study it in the lab and we can see what does it eat and what does it  
**[0:23:43-0:23:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:43):**  excrete and you know subject it to different conditions and see what happens which is great  to study that strain.  But the reality is that nowhere in nature does a strain ever exist in isolation in pure  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:58):**  culture.  It doesn't exist.  It's a man-made phenomenon.  
**[0:24:03-0:24:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:03):**  So and turns out when you grow that organism that's isolated in the presence of other  organisms its metabolism is totally different.  So I'll give you an example.  
**[0:24:22-0:24:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:22):**  Purple non-sulfur bacteria can fix nitrogen out of the air and put it into organic molecules  and excrete those molecules.  If you grow purple non-sulfur bacteria like rhodosudomonas spheroidis in pure culture  
**[0:24:43-0:24:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:43):**  and measure its production of organic molecules with nitrogen it has a certain rate at which  it can do that.  If you give it the same conditions and you add a lactobacillus culture to it the rate  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:06):**  at nitrogen fixation triples.  It goes a lot faster and that's partially because of what the metabolites that the lactic  acid bacteria are producing.  
**[0:25:22-0:25:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:22):**  So my point here is that it's very complex and when you try to break it down in the lab  to really understand it in isolation it no longer represents what you're looking at  because that isolated culture doesn't really exist in the real world.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:44):**  Well I'm glad you said that because I mean that echoes something that Dr. Paul Zorner  said when I had him on.  You put one microbe in the lab and you try and monitor what it does and then you suddenly  
**[0:25:54-0:25:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  add other soil microbes with it and you see different results.  Is this how Dr. Higa came up with that original mother culture?  Is this what makes it special?  
**[0:26:07-0:26:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:07):**  I think this is really getting at the heart of it.  You don't just have three individual things that just would do whatever they do by themselves  in the same bottle.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:16):**  You've put them in there and they've been selected to be in there because now you get  this circular ring of mutually synergistic behavior where the presence of one enhances  the performance of another and it closes that loop so you end up with something that like  
**[0:26:41-0:26:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:41):**  you said if you isolated those three out you wouldn't get the same results as if you put  them together and that's why that mother culture is so powerful being what it is.  Is it the three that are made and thriving to work together?  
**[0:27:00-0:27:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  Yeah and it's not only the three.  That's maybe something that gets overlooked or misunderstood.  I'm not going to really go into much detail because it is proprietary but there's more  
**[0:27:19-0:27:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:19):**  than those three and it doesn't start with sterile media.  So the EM culture like the mother culture it's a culture starter and it will cause the  fermentation to go in a certain direction and it will lower the pH and produce these  
**[0:27:49-0:27:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:49):**  metabolites that are inhibiting disease microbes.  But it's not inhibiting other microbes that are on the substrates.  In lactic acid bacteria or phototrophic bacteria, yeast will also be on the substrates so you're  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:14):**  going to get some of those wild strains in the culture as well.  So you really have a very diverse culture which by definition has to contain certain  levels of lactic acid bacteria, yeast and phototrophic bacteria but not only those.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:33):**  It's not only those.  I love what you're saying and now I'm thinking okay I'm a grower, I'm a farmer listening  to this.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:41):**  I want to add EM to my soil but I also have all this local microbes in my soil whether  I'm in California, New York, Kansas or Florida.  What is EM going to do to what I have locally?  
**[0:28:55-0:28:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:55):**  Yeah I think of it as a stimulant.  It's going to stimulate the beneficials in that system and those beneficials, that biology  in the system, when it gets stimulated it's going to produce more good stuff that the  
**[0:29:16-0:29:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:16):**  plants need including plant hormones, chelated minerals, plant available nutrients.  It's also going to be pushing out those undesirable microbes which they're undesirable because  their metabolites, what they excrete are oxidative or toxic to plant cells and that's why they're  
**[0:29:46-0:29:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:46):**  pathogens or that's why they're undesirable is because what they produce hurts the plants.  Whereas beneficials, the way I define it, a beneficial excretes building blocks of healthy  cells in plants or animals.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:05):**  So vitamins, antioxidants, organic acids, healthy building blocks for cells.  So yeah I think of it more as a stimulant to the system but I also recognize that, and  this may go back to what you said earlier about why it hasn't been adopted widely.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:34):**  And that is that it does take time and it takes a consistent approach whereas our mentality  is like we apply the chemical and we see the result within days or weeks.  This is stimulating the biology in a very complex system over time, it takes time.  
**[0:31:10-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:10):**  But what you can see over time is a shifting of some of those parameters that you can measure  which relate back to the health of the system.  So Dr. Higa and Dr. Parr who was with the USDA wrote an article about classifying soils  
**[0:31:33-0:31:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:33):**  based on what microbes were dominant in the system and there's basically four classes.  Like one type of soil which is very commonly associated with heavy chemical use over decades  of using chemicals, pesticides is what's called a disease inducing soil.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:59):**  So a disease inducing soil if you look at kind of broadly what kind of microbes dominate  in that system, there's a lot of pathogens.  So if you don't use the pesticides to keep the pathogen levels down, there's a lot of  
**[0:32:14-0:32:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:14):**  disease in your crop.  That's a disease inducing soil.  On the other spectrum there's a zymogenic soil and that's a soil that is like high levels  
**[0:32:25-0:32:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:25):**  of beneficial microbes producing all the nutrients for healthy plants, maximizing what the plant  needs and low incidence of disease causing microbes.  So there's two classes in the middle but what you can do is you can move a soil to that  
**[0:32:45-0:32:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:45):**  zymogenic state and that's what you want to be at because in the zymogenic state you need  less fertilizer and less pesticides and you get healthier and more productive plants.  Terms of a long term approach like, I'm with you, when people hear long term, if somebody  
**[0:33:04-0:33:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:04):**  was to go down the EM path, mother culture path and apply this to a soil, to see long  term significant meaningful change, is this a year's approach?  It is generally speaking a multi-year approach but you can see results within the first year  
**[0:33:32-0:33:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:32):**  depending on what kind of system you're dealing with.  That's another challenge.  You've got different climates, different soils, different crops, different management practices,  
**[0:33:47-0:33:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:47):**  maybe with pesticides or without.  Most are with pesticides if it's conventional farming.  But you can definitely see results in one cycle but you're not going to see maximum  
**[0:34:09-0:34:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:09):**  results in one cycle.  Now I will say though that our approach at SCD Probiotics, we've developed applications  that are more like the chemical approach.  
**[0:34:29-0:34:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:29):**  So basically biochemical products from fermentation that act like chemicals.  So I'll give you an example.  In herbicide applications, all herbicides get applied with an adjuvant, typically a  
**[0:34:48-0:34:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:48):**  non-ion extrafactant.  A non-ion extrafactant is a petroleum based petrochemical that reduces the surface tension  of water and helps penetration of the active ingredient like glyphosate for example.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:10):**  We came out with a product called ProBioAct which is fermentation based from all food  grade materials and organic materials with probiotics and that is used to replace the  non-ion extrafactant component of the herbicide.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:36):**  We're kind of talking about the basic stuff that we did 10-15 years ago but now we've  taken the technology, I mean the number of applications and products and mother cultures  and biochemical byproducts that we have now based on this technology platform is over  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:54):**  a hundred different products.  We break our business into three different segments.  One is industrial, another is agriculture and then the third is consumer products.  
**[0:36:07-0:36:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:07):**  And so just to give you kind of an idea, in the industrial segment we're replacing petrochemicals  with biobased biochemicals from fermentation in textile manufacture, leather manufacture,  paper manufacture as an example.  
**[0:36:25-0:36:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:25):**  And our goal is to basically replace petrochemicals with biobased materials that are less toxic  and have a better environmental footprint, less carbon footprint.  So that's our industrial segment.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:41):**  And then our consumer segment is like we've got dietary supplements which are basically  probiotics but consortia based probiotics.  Your typical probiotic is like a pure culture probiotic that if it has multiple species  
**[0:36:56-0:37:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:56):**  they were blended at packaging, those organisms have never lived in the presence of other  organisms so it's that pure culture approach.  But we also have come out with probiotic cleaning products.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:08):**  Of course we've got lawn care, lawn and garden products.  So all based on this fermentation and where I started which is this EM culturing technology  of consortia culturing with phototrophic bacteria and yeast and lactic acid bacteria.  
**[0:37:29-0:37:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:29):**  And then in agriculture we've got kind of your typical, we've got the bio ag mother  culture which is a mother culture for making an activation for sort of general on-farm  use.  
**[0:37:45-0:37:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:45):**  And we have quite a few farmers that do that on a very large scale.  They buy mother culture from us, we send it to them in a one ton IBC liquid tank and then  they use that to, it's called activation or basically to make a fermentation and multiply  
**[0:38:07-0:38:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  it 20 times in volume.  And then that becomes their concentrate which they use for on-farm applications.  But we also have this line of basically biochemical products which are in ag applications designed  
**[0:38:22-0:38:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:22):**  to replace the pesticides and the petrochemicals.  So the ones that are the mother cultures, one thing I think people miss on this is they  say oh it's expensive.  
**[0:38:39-0:38:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:39):**  But you could buy a gallon of it, culture it out, what like 20 times and it comes down  to cents per application.  Can you talk a little bit about that because that's a key point I think a lot of people  
**[0:38:51-0:38:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:51):**  miss.  Yeah, so you said it.  I mean a mother culture, it can be used directly but if you want to do it economically then  
**[0:39:08-0:39:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:08):**  you can do one part of mother culture with one part molasses and 20 parts water and do  a fermentation that's fairly simple but also very predictable what kind of results you'll  get.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:28):**  And you know it, yeah so like if you buy a liter for $30 of mother culture and then you  can turn it into 20 liters of mother culture then it means that it costs you $1.50 per  liter of finished product.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:51):**  Right and I'm looking at your page here so for somebody in ag or gardening SCD, the bio  ag would be the product you'd recommend people start with?  Yes.  
**[0:40:02-0:40:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:02):**  And what's a typical...  I also recommend the kitchen composter or the Bokashi composter because that's a really  easy way to recycle your food waste into your garden and you know it's pretty convenient  
**[0:40:27-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:27):**  and it also kind of introduces people to fermentation which that's one of the things where like  going back to sort of the roots of this with Dr. Higa, he in Okinawa, Japan and Japan in  general and Korea as well there's this actually all over the world in certain ways there's  
**[0:40:53-0:41:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:53):**  this practice of fermentation for food right?  Miso, kimchi, cheese, yogurt, sauerkraut and the thing that Dr. Higa observed in Japan  they also do fermentation to feed the soil.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:19):**  There's some techniques and traditions where it's fermentation not just to feed your family  or to feed your livestock but to also feed the soil and to grow plants and so you know  he started looking at that but from the traditional approach like farmers who had been doing fermentation  
**[0:41:43-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:43):**  for hundreds of years to feed their soil no microbiology just the practice and the tradition  those cultures though being passed down because those fermentation and those cultures are  maintained so you know he started looking at that as because he was in search of an  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07):**  alternative to the chemical approach because he saw the side effects and the toxicity that  can come from the chemicals and so he was looking for a way to use nature to reduce  the chemicals and that you know what we do in our business is really true to that today  
**[0:42:28-0:42:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:28):**  I mean we've brought that concept and applied science and applied you know millions of dollars  and you know research and development to but starting with that concept of these consortia  fermentation cultures you know can create all kinds of useful beneficial products both  
**[0:42:53-0:43:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:53):**  biochemical as well as live microbial or biological.  What are your thoughts on using these products as foliar feeds?  Is there any benefit to that or is it all straight to soil?  
**[0:43:10-0:43:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:10):**  No I think definitely foliar feeds is an important application there's a lot going on on the  phyelosphere of plants there's definitely a microbial community there and so you know  what you don't want is pathogens dominating on the phyelosphere of plants you get disease  
**[0:43:35-0:43:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:35):**  and stress to the plant from those pathogens so having beneficial microbes and their metabolites  on the surfaces of plants is one benefit from a foliar feed and you know I'm not really  up to speed on the science of how much nutrients are absorbed through the phyelosphere but  
**[0:44:00-0:44:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:00):**  I think it's still it's material or significant so yeah I definitely would recommend foliar  feeds.  One thing you talked about is beneficial microbes push out pathogenic microbes is that by push  
**[0:44:19-0:44:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:19):**  out does that mean out compete prey upon or alter conditions so pathogenic microbes can't  survive or all the above?  It's all the above I mean I have to be careful and make the disclaimer that you know we're  
**[0:44:43-0:44:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:43):**  not making pesticide claims with our products and according to the EPA if you make a claim  that you affect the metabolism of another organism then by definition it's a pesticide  so claims about competitive exclusion can't really be made with a product unless you're  
**[0:45:08-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:08):**  going to get a pesticide registration but the concept of competitive exclusion is basically  that within a system okay whether it's a soil or it's the rhizosphere or the phyelosphere  or the surface of the countertop surface in your home or the surface of your skin there's  
**[0:45:31-0:45:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:31):**  in ecological terms there's what's known as a niche and a carrying capacity and it's  basically means that within a defined space or niche there's a certain amount of life  that will be there that will be supported by that by space by air by moisture other  
**[0:45:53-0:46:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:53):**  types of nutrient compounds are there and you know a microbial cell doesn't need a lot  it can sit there dormant doing nothing for you know years actually so everything's got  this niche and this carrying capacity now if you put certain microbes there on a regular  
**[0:46:14-0:46:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:14):**  basis you're going to influence which microbes are living there because it can only support  so many microbes so let's say a particular niche can support a hundred cells of microbes  well if you put 90 cells there that are these beneficials then there's only space for 10  
**[0:46:36-0:46:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:36):**  cells of pathogens just using a simple example  when I apply a mother culture like the bioag or something a lot of the worry that people  have is I'm going to pour it on and like I don't know if it's going to live or die what  
**[0:46:55-0:47:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:55):**  can you say to give me some cause to relax on that you know because I think the worry  is I'm going to apply it but there's already like local micro microbiome there that's thriving  and it could be like you know I'm dropping these new guys in and they're just like nope  
**[0:47:16-0:47:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:16):**  not coming in here not setting up shop like we're dominating and then you just poured  it on and they like it best become food for other microbes what are your thoughts on that  I mean you know the best thing is to measure the quality you know what what qualities are  
**[0:47:36-0:47:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:36):**  you measuring or what what qualities of the system are you observing or measuring and  those are where you should look to see the benefits of using these types of cultures  so if you're if you're seeing what you should expect to see is changes in the the physical  
**[0:47:57-0:48:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:57):**  structure of the soil improvements in the cation exchange capacity of the soil decreases  in undesirable microbes increases in beneficial microbes all those are all things that you  can see I mean that you can measure but you really see it in in the in the health of your  
**[0:48:16-0:48:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:16):**  crop or maybe in the health of the soil that you can observe it so it kind of doesn't matter  whether it's it's happening because the microbes survived or because they fed something or  some metabolite stimulated the system it really doesn't matter if you're getting the benefits  
**[0:48:38-0:48:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:38):**  that you can measure and see in terms of productivity yield that type of thing one thing I do want  to make sure we cover in this is if we look at the three main groups and I know you've  emphasized there's more than three but if we look at the three main kind of by definition  
**[0:48:55-0:49:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  groups in that mother culture let's go through them so we have lactobacillus phototrophic  bacteria in yeast can you talk about each one specifically and its role in the soil  so if I just had lactobacillus to the soil what is that doing for the soil and the plants  
**[0:49:18-0:49:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:18):**  in that soil and then just just going down the list  well each all three of them produce different types of substances that are beneficial to  plants like plant hormones or plant available nutrients or they produce substances metabolites  
**[0:49:46-0:49:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:46):**  that interact with the nutrients in the soil to make them plant available and then they  don't produce things that stress the plants which is what pathogens do produce so you  know they each have different types of things they produce in those broad categories like  
**[0:50:15-0:50:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:15):**  phototrophic bacteria produce antioxidants and they they also can engage the nitrogen  cycle they can fix nitrogen out of the air for example lactic acid bacteria produce organic  acids which have a have a benefit for the area around the rhizosphere yeast produce  
**[0:50:47-0:51:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  vitamins and chelating materials so you know they but it may not be that those are those  those things they produce are being directly absorbed by the plant it could be that they're  stimulating that biology so the overall activity increases but increases in a certain way that's  
**[0:51:20-0:51:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:20):**  beneficial rather than you know not rather than pathogens that are producing stress compounds  would that be the case for adding a mother culture to a traditional compost pile lactobacillus  isn't going to break down lignin in wood but it might produce byproducts that feed the  
**[0:51:46-0:51:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:46):**  fungi that break down the wood yeah exactly we we do a lot of composting inoculants and  projects and you know yes one is accelerating the process it absolutely you know you can  measure the acceleration of the process making it more uniform so that you're getting a more  
**[0:52:10-0:52:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:10):**  consistent finished product which is important important in commercial composting where the  end products being used for fertilizer one of the so the beneficial microbes going in  a fermentative or regenerative pathway versus putrefactive pathway so disease microbes are  
**[0:52:46-0:52:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:46):**  defined as disease microbes because they secrete or they excrete metabolites that are stressful  to plants and animals that oxidize the cells and damage the plant so it it just so happens  that those those types of organisms also produce foul smells a lot of those metabolites are  
**[0:53:15-0:53:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:15):**  odor compounds so it's like we have god-given built into us the ability to tell if something  is bad because it's putrefied and it smells bad if you grow e.coli in the lab for example  you know it it stinks okay so with with the regenerative pathway the beneficial microbes  
**[0:53:41-0:53:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:41):**  it it doesn't stink it it's it's more of a sweet fermented smell a pickling smell and  it doesn't linger and it doesn't go long distances it it's there but it kind of goes away whereas  a stinky one like if you go to a place where there's high levels of foul odor compounds  
**[0:54:03-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:03):**  in the air like maybe on a livestock barn or a wastewater treatment sludge handling  plant like that stuff sticks to your clothes like you leave that place and you gotta you  gotta change because it it still smells um so you know that that's just so in composting  
**[0:54:27-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  odor control we have some clients that are like doing large-scale composting near urban  areas and they can't have a foul odor they'll get shut down so they use our product not  only for accelerating the process but also for controlling odors and the odor control  
**[0:54:49-0:54:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  is done effectively like if we look at the microbial side it's just eliminating those  or lessening the putrefying organisms that would create the odor to begin with that and  and there's also um there's a there's a chemical effect so you know one one effect for odor  
**[0:55:09-0:55:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:09):**  control is displacing the microbes that create odors another is odor compounds that already  exist and neutralizing them instantaneously chemically you know one is a biological process  that can happen over time the other is a an immediate chemical reaction which is neutralizing  
**[0:55:30-0:55:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:30):**  an odor compound okay thinking ahead somebody goes down a program of regenerative ag and  really changes their microbial makeup in their soil for the better through a product like  yours and just good agricultural practices is there a way that you see that someone and  
**[0:56:01-0:56:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:01):**  really that i think this is how the community ultimately benefits at the end of the day  if this is possible where i could take some of my healthy soil and culture that out use  that to seed microbiology in another part of the farm at the neighbor's farm because  
**[0:56:20-0:56:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:20):**  eventually like i'm just thinking i i apply your stuff and it's great that i'm buying  this consortia from you but a lot of the benefit i'm getting is local to me because that consortia  is stimulating what i have is there a way for me to now share this built up microbial  
**[0:56:41-0:56:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:41):**  base  historically yes i don't know that it's the cost benefit is there you know to to do it  that way um and there's also risks because you're not you're not eliminating pathogens  
**[0:57:03-0:57:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:03):**  in your system like there's still pathogens in the in in your soil in fact one of the  things that dr jiga used to say in like microbiology 101 class was it's not the presence of a pathogen  that causes a problem it's it's the high population of the pathogen and in fact pathogens in low  
**[0:57:26-0:57:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:26):**  population are actually beneficial because they stimulate the immune response so you  don't actually want to get rid of all the pathogens you want there to be low levels  of pathogens because that actually stimulates the immune response you don't want you don't  
**[0:57:46-0:57:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:46):**  want those populations to get so high that you get the symptoms of disease that's that  that means there's an imbalance and this organism is is too high so when with that understanding  if you take that to culturing your soil or your compost or you know those practices there's  
**[0:58:07-0:58:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:07):**  some risk that you you you end up growing and proliferating something that you don't  want to um unless you have you know some sophisticated microbiology lab capabilities but um you know  i i feel like that's really what like the value proposition for our business with mother  
**[0:58:31-0:58:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:31):**  cultures is that we provide a reasonably priced product that is consistent and quality controlled  and you know when you use it to to to start a fermentation you're going to get consistent  results you're going to get a the the production of those beneficial microbes and their metabolites  
**[0:58:53-0:59:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:53):**  and yeah can you do it on your own like you're saying theoretically i probably probably but  you know i i don't know that that's really practical is there an overboard can i like  say i'm on a farm that requires 100 irrigation where and every time i irrigate some of that  
**[0:59:16-0:59:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  mother culture is going out in the line could that be a problem no i mean it's it's self-limiting  i mean yes too much of a good thing is a bad thing right you you can you can like for example  a plant that's highly sensitive to ph if you poured mother culture straight on its roots  
**[0:59:41-0:59:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:41):**  you you you would probably damage it because of the acidity but but those are all not really  practical situations like a farmer or a gardener they don't want to use too much like why why  why put it on straight why overdo it you know um so yeah i mean i i i believe in too much  
**[1:00:04-1:00:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:04):**  of a good thing is a bad thing concept but from a practical point of view there you know  we never see it we never see like oh i added too much and therefore you know i have a damage  in the system it's somewhat limiting again because of that niche and carrying capacity  
**[1:00:21-1:00:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:21):**  concept um you know if you use too much then yeah it's more will die off and you won't  get the benefit of having used double the amount for example so just to sum this all  up i mean is the is the whole gist here really we're in a world that's became microbially  
**[1:00:43-1:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:43):**  depleted and using a mother culture like the one you produce is one tool to help reseed  and repopulate microbes in these depressed microbial populations around the world yes  i would say it's slightly differently in that i wouldn't say we're in a microbially depleted  
**[1:01:12-1:01:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:12):**  world i'd say that a lot of you know this is a very general statement first of all right  um but a lot of a lot of this ecosystems especially farming systems are they're stressed or they're  depleted or they're they're worn out or they have high chemical residues built up um and  
**[1:01:38-1:01:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:38):**  using a mother culture using a product like ours um it stimulates the beneficial ecology  of that system so it's i see it more of as a stimulate stimulant rather than um like  a microbial inoculant.  
**[1:02:23-1:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-19-MatthewWood-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  Thank you.

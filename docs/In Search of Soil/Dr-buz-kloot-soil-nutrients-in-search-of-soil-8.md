### In Search of Soil  (2020-12-02)  

**[0:00:00-0:00:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:00):**  So, we meet again.  What if you took a soil test and that test showed that nutrient levels were at value  X.  
**[0:00:26-0:00:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:26):**  And then you grew crops in that same soil and you took a soil test later on and that  test revealed that those nutrient levels had increased over the time in which those crops  were growing.  
**[0:00:38-0:00:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:38):**  What was responsible for that increase and where did it come from?  How much of a role did biology play in that?  That's exactly what my guest today, Dr. Buzz Clute found in a study that he conducted.  
**[0:00:51-0:00:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:00:51):**  And we found that where we did not apply potassium.  Our potassium, the ending soil test potassium values were higher than where we did apply  potassium.  
**[0:01:05-0:01:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:05):**  So, we have seen that in many cases, even though you don't apply the recommended nutrient,  your soil test value actually improves.  That's Dr. Buzz Clute.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:20):**  He's a researcher at the University of South Carolina and it's studies just like this that  helped him become a big believer in the importance of biology and healthy soils.  Today Buzz and I are going to talk about a variety of topics just like this.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:35):**  How important is biology?  How do you know that that biology is working?  Meaning soil tests and why you should maybe question or think about soil tests a little  
**[0:01:43-0:01:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:43):**  differently.  Let's jump right into the conversation and get talking soil with Dr. Buzz Clute.  This is In Search of Soil.  
**[0:01:52-0:01:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:52):**  How would you say your background in chemical engineering has helped you when you moved  into the soil space?  I think as a chemical engineer, you get trained or any kind of engineer, you get trained to  
**[0:02:07-0:02:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:07):**  solve problems.  So that and a background, my main background was more inorganic chemistry, more than organic  chemistry.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:17):**  So it was more the background that I had of solving problems more than anything else.  And I just saw that in soils we had some issues.  And you may or may not know this, but my undergrad was chemical engineering and my PhD was actually  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:39):**  in aquatic sciences.  And within about five years, I was already thinking about quitting aquatic sciences just  because I saw huge problems in water pollution, but no way out of being able to fix those  
**[0:02:59-0:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:59):**  huge problems.  My understanding at the time was that soils were the static bodies and that, yeah, it's  nice to know about them.  
**[0:03:09-0:03:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:09):**  But it never occurred to me that soils could change.  And you probably have heard of this, but that changed when I met Ray Archuleta.  I want to think it was about February 2010.  
**[0:03:26-0:03:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:26):**  And in the space of about a morning, he completely changed the way, at least the way I looked  at life, I looked at soils.  And that changed everything.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:38):**  So going back to your question, my background gave me a basic discipline of being able to  solve problems.  But a lot of the static mindset that I brought, I had to actually unlearn.  
**[0:03:53-0:03:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:53):**  Does that answer your question?  It does.  And do you think that you had an advantage coming in to soils the way you did where you  
**[0:04:02-0:04:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02):**  weren't brought up through the university system of learning conventional ag teachings?  And you might have came through with a mindset of how soils were, but you had that problem  solving mindset.  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13):**  So you kind of came in, you talked to somebody like Ray, and now it's like, okay, I'm not  entrenched into some sort of ideology or thought process.  You can adapt where I think one problem a lot of people have, and this isn't a soil  
**[0:04:26-0:04:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:26):**  thing, this is an every industry thing, is they've been in it so long, it's hard for  them to think outside the box, to shift paradigms.  Did you coming from the outside?  
**[0:04:36-0:04:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36):**  Do you think that's helped with how you've approached soil science?  I think that it's a two-edged sword.  It certainly helps you because you, especially if you don't come from a particular university,  
**[0:04:51-0:04:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51):**  you're not bowing to the holy writ of the local or the state fertilizer recommendations.  Nutrient management was kind of the thing that I kind of got into.  So you're certainly not beholden to your professors and the leaders in a particular land-grant  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:13):**  university.  But I think, on the other hand, there's a disadvantage in that I've had to kind of get  up to speed on things like plant physiology on my own as well.  
**[0:05:27-0:05:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:27):**  So I think that there's both a disadvantage and advantage.  And when you dive into the whole thing with both feet, you make a lot of mistakes.  And I think I've made a lot of mistakes over the last 10 years.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:44):**  What's been the biggest mistake that you've made that has really helped you use that as  a stepping stone to evolve knowledge?  I would probably say the biggest mistake that I've made has been to ignore mineral nutrition.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:07):**  Not so much the moron NPK kind of nutrition, you know, just pile hundreds and hundreds  pounds.  But I've been dismissive about the role of things like micronutrients.  
**[0:06:21-0:06:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:21):**  And I'm only beginning to catch that up.  So I think it's worked.  I've been lucky with the farmers that I've worked and given advice.  
**[0:06:29-0:06:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:29):**  I've said, you don't need to apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to grow a crop.  You don't need to apply as much nitrogen.  You've got to follow the five principles of soil health.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44):**  But you know, the guys have managed to get through because they were good farmers.  But I think accelerating the process of regeneration, you've got other people who have done a lot  better in terms of beginning to understand things like micronutrients, foliar application  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:08):**  of those things and also of compost.  So again, you know, I threw the baby out with the bathwater and saying, well, you don't  have to apply NPK to grow a crop.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:23):**  But I remained somewhat agnostic about some of the very vital roles that were being played  in micronutrients.  And part of that, you know, is also realizing the impact of things like nitrogenous fertilizers,  
**[0:07:42-0:07:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:42):**  and then a lot of our pesticides and herbicides, like some of the guys from Acres USA called  the Devil's Pantry, and some of the harm that they do in sequestering a lot of the essential  nutrients we have.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:57):**  So we may do a plant tissue test and say, oh, my goodness, we've got all the micronutrients  we need.  And yet those might be sequestered in the plant itself.  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:09):**  So that's, I think I threw out the baby with the bathwater then.  Yeah.  So just focusing on the bigger but missing the micro.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:17):**  And I've talked to some people who view micronutrients as they're obviously needed for plant physiology,  but they are available in the soil if the biology is there to unlock it, be that arbuscular  mycorrhizal fungi and other soil microorganisms that can break those down and get those in  
**[0:08:40-0:08:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:40):**  contact with the plant roots.  Where do you stand now in terms of the importance of these micronutrients when it comes to plant  growth in the soil?  
**[0:08:52-0:09:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:52):**  Yeah, well, first of all, I would put myself firmly in the school of if you're doing the  cover crops, you're keeping the soil, you're not disturbing the soil, you've got diversity  and then incorporate incorporating livestock, I'm definitely of the opinion that we can  
**[0:09:15-0:09:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:15):**  unlock those things.  So I haven't changed that.  But I do think that things like micronutrients, and again, I'm still in kindergarten, but  
**[0:09:28-0:09:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:28):**  I think micronutrients, the judicious use of micronutrients, and even small amounts  of other micronutrients in the soil in the in foliar applications, may unlock a lot of  the potential of the soil, especially in degraded soil.  
**[0:09:49-0:09:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:49):**  One of the things that become more aware of is the role of calcium that I that I'd never  heard about, for instance.  So that's, I'm trying to experiment with that over here, in part tests and things like that  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:06):**  to see, well, if I apply calcium to the soil, how, for instance, would that help my vegetation  vegetative growth?  And those are questions that I'm still working on.  
**[0:10:20-0:10:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:20):**  And I think when some people hear of studies like that, they want to turn to an amendment.  And there's a huge industry out there that sells stuff to farmers and gardeners to put  on the soil.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:34):**  And you can just see boxes and boxes of it.  When it comes to these micronutrients and even macronutrients, do you think it's the  problem is us not adding them to the soil?  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:46):**  Because when people say, well, they're important, they're not in the soil, how do they get there  if I don't put them there?  Where do you stand on that?  
**[0:10:54-0:10:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:54):**  Well, I would imagine there's a balance.  Let me tell you some of the stories that I've seen over the last five or six years where  there's a particular, there are a couple of operations that I've consulted to for the  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:10):**  last five, six years.  And for instance, and in one of the studies I did, for instance, we did not apply potassium  to a certain set of static plots, 10 static plots.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:29):**  We didn't apply potassium for four years, and we took six crops, corn, wheat, soybean  crops, so two rotations of that.  And we found that where we did not apply potassium, our potassium, the ending soil test potassium  
**[0:11:49-0:11:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:49):**  values were higher than where we did apply, sorry, not soil, where we did apply fertiliser  potassium.  So we have seen that in many cases, even though you don't apply the recommended nutrient,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:08):**  your soil test value actually improves.  I've seen this on another couple of farms where on the one farm where we haven't applied  any phosphorus or potassium for several years, and those values pretty much hold steady.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:25):**  They go up and they go down depending on the weather.  Where we have applied chicken litter in two years out of three, we've actually seen steady  increases in soil test phosphorus.  
**[0:12:39-0:12:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:39):**  Not a surprise, but also things like increases in soil test calcium.  So there's no doubt that we have witnessed increases in nutrients sometimes where those  nutrients haven't been applied.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:57):**  And the thing in common with many of them is that they've had cover crops.  One of the things I run into often if I say, hey, you know, we haven't put lime on this  place for several years and the pH has stayed steady.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:13):**  Then I say, well, we put chicken litter out there two out of three years and immediately,  you know, folks say, well, that's the thing.  But where we haven't used chicken litter or lime, we've seen very, very steady values.  
**[0:13:28-0:13:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:28):**  And this is in the work I've done.  It's been the Malic one, which is sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid double acid extraction.  So we just haven't seen any change.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:42):**  Whereas, you know, five years ago, we were warned that if we didn't apply fertilizers,  our nutrient stocks would crash.  And we haven't seen that.  
**[0:13:53-0:13:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:53):**  It's a pretty interesting study.  And if you think about that for the average person listening to this, you start with a  plot and you're not adding anything and you've taken a soil test up in front.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:04):**  So, you know what the potassium value is in the soil.  And then years later, it is increased.  But you haven't applied potassium.  
**[0:14:13-0:14:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13):**  Where has the potassium came from?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I listened to a lovely talk by Richard Mulvaney.  
**[0:14:25-0:14:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:25):**  He was actually talking to, my brain's just gone dead, in a podcast.  But basically, you know, the potassium, we've got more potassium in the soil than we know  about.  
**[0:14:45-0:14:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:45):**  And so plant roots access that.  And then of course, your mycorrhizal fungi and all of the biology accesses that.  And you know, soil soils don't end at six inches.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:58):**  They go down into the subsoil.  And in the coastal plain of South Carolina, you know, with many of our good soils, between  eight and 12 inches, we get into a B horizon where you play begins to, you know, your play  
**[0:15:16-0:15:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16):**  begins to increase.  So even though we have one on one clays, with low CECs, we're still seeing quite a lot of  potassium.  
**[0:15:30-0:15:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:30):**  So what we know, what we seem to see is that the potassium in the in the rock matrix becomes  available through, we think biology.  I'm sure there are other chemical processes.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:46):**  But you know, so it goes from the rock matrix inaccessible to what we would call exchangeable  to then to soluble.  And these are in a dynamic equilibrium.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:04):**  And we think that when we add a lot of biology to the system in terms of cover crops, or,  you know, always having a living root either cover crop or cash crop, we're kind of keeping  that biology going.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:17):**  And so we're bringing that calcium from the mineral.  And it's being made, not the calcium, the potassium, and the same goes for something  like calcium as well.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:32):**  Do you think that one of the things we could be seeing in soils and I haven't heard anybody  talk on this, but when you spoke about clays, I started thinking about this.  Are clays breaking down in soils into some of their more simpler elements?  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47):**  So clay is obviously a molecule made up of multiple elements bound together.  Is biology breaking some of those bonds?  So something where a clay soil, somebody thinks, oh, that can be a disadvantage.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:00):**  It's obviously has water holding capacity, which is an advantage.  But in biology, some of that clay actually changes from clay into some of its more raw  elements, which can then become plants available.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12):**  Have you seen that or does that seem possible knowing your chemistry background?  Yeah, that's something that I wouldn't necessarily be totally qualified to talk about.  But certainly, you know, if you think about weathering, and in South Carolina, we've had  
**[0:17:33-0:17:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:33):**  a lot of, you know, for instance, cotton farming, and we lost all of our topsoil.  And so in some of the land where we've put back into, you know, woods and forests, and  then also in some of the land that was spared, say, in, you know, in where people kept livestock  
**[0:17:55-0:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:55):**  and managed the soils well, you do see that a horizon forming.  So yes, you know, clay continues to interact or the soil biology continues to interact  with the clay.  
**[0:18:11-0:18:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:11):**  Carbon is added to the system through photosynthesis.  So you do see a breaking down of that.  The exact mechanisms, I don't know, but certainly, you know, thinking soil tests in general,  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:23):**  if a soil test isn't going to tell you how much phosphates available in your soil, if  it's bound up.  So in some of these systems, you know, you had phosphate increase, but your initial soil  
**[0:18:36-0:18:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:36):**  tests said you had X and you've increased X to Y over that time.  So the soil test missed that.  And you would have thought, okay, well, I have to add minerals.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:45):**  I know you've seen the same thing with other studies, and we can get into that of adding  nitrogen and maybe not having to add the prescribed amounts that a soil test would dictate.  When you think about what data you're getting from a soil test, considering it doesn't have  
**[0:19:00-0:19:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:00):**  any sort of biological measures on it, it's really just measuring what is there now.  Can you actually get valuable information off of that to work with?  Or is that kind of a flawed test just given what it is measuring?  
**[0:19:16-0:19:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:16):**  Yeah, that's a good question.  And that extends to biology as well, I think.  I guess the most valuable thing I can contribute to that, because I used to model water quality,  
**[0:19:29-0:19:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:29):**  and I stole from the water quality modeling people, but I basically have a maxim that  says all soil tests are wrong, some are useful.  And so first of all, we need to recognize that there are so many different ways of extracting  
**[0:19:49-0:19:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:49):**  nutrients from the soil.  So you've got Mehlich-1, Mehlich-3, Morgan, Bray, and the list goes on and on.  The Haney extraction as well, some of them use harsh acids, some of them use organic  
**[0:20:04-0:20:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:04):**  acids.  The biggest beef that many people have with some of the newer things like Haney is, well,  where are the calibrated soil tests?  
**[0:20:13-0:20:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:13):**  The implication being that the other soil tests from many land grant universities are  calibrated.  But if you start comparing, say, Illinois and Indiana, or I think Alabama and Georgia,  
**[0:20:32-0:20:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:32):**  and you just go across the state line, you often see in the nutrient recommendations,  if you just cross the state line, that one state might recommend about double the amount  of nutrients in terms of cost compared to the other state.  
**[0:20:51-0:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:51):**  So the question goes to which is real.  And I think the value of any soil test is going to be based on calibrated returns or  calibrated looking at crops growing and how that is calibrated.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:07):**  And most of my understanding is certainly in my state, most of the calibrated stuff  was done a long time ago.  And so we've kind of extrapolated and borrowed from other states.  
**[0:21:24-0:21:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:24):**  So if you don't have the actual data for your soil test and how the plant will respond to  a particular treatment, you're kind of just guessing in terms of what response we have.  And again, in my state in South Carolina, the soils that we were looking at, based on  
**[0:21:48-0:21:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:48):**  our land grant university tests, demanded that we put about 100 pounds an acre of potassium  or K2O, which is probably close to about 160 pounds of myriad of potash per year.  Yet we never saw any response to that.  
**[0:22:08-0:22:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:08):**  Conventional wisdom was that we were insane and we were going to lose our minds, you know,  we were going to lose our shirts with that, but we never saw any crop responses.  So the way I look at soil tests is usually I like to kind of look at trends over time,  
**[0:22:25-0:22:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:25):**  because what we have seen is that if you stop applying P and K, your soil test values aren't  just going to drop through the floor.  Now we've only done that with cover crops.  
**[0:22:38-0:22:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:38):**  I'm more inclined as I go along to start looking at soil tests that use less harsh extraction  methods like the Haney test or some of the Morgan tests.  But again, I'm not an expert on that.  
**[0:22:58-0:23:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:58):**  Again, a lot of the beef that a lot of people have with the Haney test shows where the data  are.  But I would also say that, you know, you look across the country and the data we collected  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:10):**  on crop response to nutrient recommendations came from 40, 50, 60 years ago when soils  look very different to what they are today.  Based upon what you know and you've seen and maybe what you think, do you think in a system  
**[0:23:27-0:23:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:27):**  that grows a cash crop, meaning a crop that will be removed off the property, that farmers  could survive going amendment-less, where you are not adding amendments or inputs to  the soil and the cash crops don't suffer?  
**[0:23:48-0:23:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:48):**  Now say the amendments you could bring in would be, say, cover crops or maybe that's  grazing animals, but you're not putting chemical supplements into the soil.  Is amendment-less, input-less farming possible or would it fall back to that kind of conventional  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:07):**  wisdom of you're mining your soils and if you don't add, eventually you're going to  run out?  Yeah, okay.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:14):**  So that's a great question.  So rule of thumb is 80% of a plant's energy is going to come from the atmosphere.  So we think of elements like nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen makes up about 80% of the  
**[0:24:31-0:24:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:31):**  plant if not more.  So my answer would be in a, the simple answer would be yes, but the caveat would be that  you've got to get your soil to that point.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:47):**  You've got to build it up.  And how is that, because I've heard of this being described by somebody as a perpetual  motion machine.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:59):**  And one of the things that we keep on, we forget is that the most important energy source  for farms comes from the sun.  So we're getting, Dwayne Beck once said this and I'll never forget it.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:18):**  It was a farmer's job is to harvest sunlight and water.  And so as a farmer harvest sunlight and water, so that's going to be the energy, the carbon,  hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen for that matter in a good system.  
**[0:25:35-0:25:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:35):**  The rest of the mineral energy can come from the soil.  Now if you've got a system like Gay Brown has, and there are a few guys that are already  in that system, and it's not just Gay Brown, it's a lot of guys.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:54):**  They are working in a situation where the sunlight harvested is essentially driving  the rest of the system.  It's just going to be made much easier when you've got diversity, when you've got animals  
**[0:26:13-0:26:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:13):**  on the farm as well.  So the short answer is yes, but there are a lot of caveats to that.  In terms of mining your soil, well, Richard Mulvaney also said, well, I guess you could  
**[0:26:31-0:26:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:31):**  mine the soil and deplete the soil.  It's a little bit trying to deplete the salt from the ocean.  It's a long term thing, and there's always minerals underneath your A horizon as you  
**[0:26:48-0:26:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:48):**  go down.  And again, it's not something I've articulated properly, but that is not a, in the short  to medium term, that is not a concern.  
**[0:27:00-0:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:00):**  I think the concern is to return farms to a regenerative future.  Let's go back to some of your aquatic systems background.  If you think about aquatic systems, do we have a better understanding of those than  
**[0:27:13-0:27:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:13):**  we do soil systems?  When I got my PhD, I think I was still very much, my mindset was in engineering.  And so it was all about, let's fix this problem.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:28):**  You know, okay, well, we've got a problem with polluted water.  Let's put in a grass strip and a buffer, and that's going to fix the problem.  So there was no kind of, okay, well, we've put a diaper, you know, we've put a diaper  
**[0:27:44-0:27:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:44):**  practice on it, but we never actually found the underlying cause of the problem.  So we thought, well, runoff is the problem.  And in fact, you know, runoff is not our problem.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:00):**  Infiltration is our problem.  So if you have a mindset that says, okay, well, we need to put all of these catch ponds  and buffer strips in, you miss the opportunity to say, well, what if we increased infiltration  
**[0:28:15-0:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:15):**  through keeping the soil covered, through keeping alive root in the soil?  It completely changes your mindset.  So it's again, a little bit difficult to sort of comment on that on my background.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:29):**  Again, it was just the basic discipline and really kind of the desire to make some sort  of positive change in the community.  I just felt really, really frustrated as an aquatic scientist.  
**[0:28:46-0:28:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:46):**  You know, any kind of improvement was directly dependent on government funding.  Whereas I think that the opportunity I saw, remember, I'm in a school of public health.  The opportunity I saw, the biggest bang for the back, I would think is if you got farmers  
**[0:29:05-0:29:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:05):**  excited about soil health and about regenerating systems.  So just in the small area of influence I've had, you know, tens of thousands of acres  of farmers who have rethought the whole idea of more on fertilizer and started doing cover  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:25):**  crops and things.  And certainly not just directly to me, farmers trust farmers better.  So there's that knock on effect.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:33):**  Yeah, and hopefully podcasts and interviews like this will help get some farmers interested  in regeneration.  And I share an engineering background with you.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:43):**  And I come at it from a problem solving mindset.  Yet I think a lot of when you look at soils, it's not really what can I do to solve this  problem.  
**[0:29:55-0:29:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:55):**  A lot of times it's what can I not do.  And you go back to more of a natural system.  And you have, you know, the five principles of soil health.  
**[0:30:04-0:30:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:04):**  Can you run through those?  Because I think those are problem solving steps that people can use to turn soil.  But it's not add this, do more of this, do more of this.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:15):**  It is a lot of backing off a little bit and letting nature more take the reins.  Yeah.  Well we need to distinguish between practices and principles.  
**[0:30:27-0:30:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:27):**  So practice would be cover crop.  A practice might be, you know, no till.  Or a practice might be a certain kind of tillage.  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:38):**  Or even, you know, livestock fencing.  So practices are the details that we can implement, you know, once we understand the system.  The five principles of soil health as I learned them was number one, keep disturbance to a  
**[0:30:59-0:31:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:59):**  minimum.  That's minimum physical, chemical, and biological disturbance.  And keep in mind that farming is nothing other than managing disturbance.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11):**  Because when we plant a corn crop in the ground of what was formerly prairie land, you know,  we are disturbing system.  But we're trying to keep that disturbance to a minimum.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:23):**  So first is keeping, sorry, minimum disturbance.  Keeping the soil covered either with a layer of residue or a living canopy.  Third one is, sorry, keep a live root in the soil year round.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:48):**  So that's again related to having a canopy up there.  But if you're keeping live roots in the soil year round, you have a way of, or as many  days of the year as possible, you have a way of harvesting sunlight.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:03):**  And indeed water because I think, you know, your infiltration rates increase, especially  around the plant and the plant roots.  But the plant harvests the sunlight and then feeds the soil microbes.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:16):**  So keep the soil, minimum disturbance, keep the soil covered, keep a live root.  The fourth one is diversity, diversity, diversity.  So this is starting to diversify not only through crop rotations, but add a lot of diversity  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:36):**  through multi species cover crops.  So you know, if you did corn and soybeans, but you had, you know, 10 species in your  cover crop, all of a sudden you're going from two species every two years to 12 species  
**[0:32:52-0:32:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:52):**  every two years.  You throw a warm season cover crop in there and all of a sudden you're going up to 20  species.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:00):**  And then the fifth one, and which a lot of people argue is part B of the fourth principle  of diversity is integrate livestock back into your system because our systems really were  never designed to work without livestock.  
**[0:33:20-0:33:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:20):**  So you know, there's a lot more of an emphasis there.  And we see that as a rule of thumb, I think guys who incorporate livestock back into their  cropping systems are seeing bigger improvements.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:35):**  So just going back up because a lot of commentary, minimum disturbance, keep the soil covered,  keep a live root in the soil, diversity, diversity, diversity, and then keep livestock in the  corn system.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:50):**  Is there one of those that you think that if farmers started to do more of that, they  would see a huge change?  I get they're five, they're all interconnected, they're all important, but is there one on  
**[0:34:04-0:34:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:04):**  that list that they could potentially have more of a leverage effect to it?  Well actually, when we talk about keep alive, keep the soil covered with a canopy, keep  a live root in the soil and diversity, diversity, diversity, multi-species cover crops actually  
**[0:34:27-0:34:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:27):**  really tick the check the boxes for all three.  So we have seen farmers be transformed in the way they think by multi-species cover  crops.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:39):**  So it captures their imagination, they can go in and see with their own eyes what those  multi-species cover crops do, either in the reducing of inputs or in the coastal plan  of South Carolina.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:55):**  A lot of the farmers that I know never saw earthworms in their field.  And within about a year or so after having cover crops, many guys come in and saying,  where did the earthworms come from?  
**[0:35:09-0:35:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:09):**  So to answer your question, the one practice that covers the three principles would be  multi-species cover crops.  That's certainly what I've seen.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:23):**  I think farmers like that feedback.  It's very visual and you can also feel it, the soil underground and you can smell it,  you can pick that soil and it smells like a forest floor.  
**[0:35:38-0:35:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:38):**  So I would say that's where you'd probably want to start is those multi-species cover  crops.  Do you have any case studies or farms that you visited throughout the years that you  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:50):**  could kind of walk through an iteration of they weren't using the practice of multi-species  cover cropping to now they are and these are some of the changes that they saw?  Just to put a little bit of numbers behind it.  
**[0:36:03-0:36:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:03):**  Yes, I actually have two case studies.  Do you want me to talk about them now?  Sure.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:12):**  Yeah, I'll do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[0:36:15-0:36:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:15):**  Well, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but let's go for the simpler one is a  guy called Jason Carter who lives close to Columbia, South Carolina.  He started his first cover crop about seven or eight years ago and the second year that  
**[0:36:39-0:36:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:39):**  he and the first year he did his multi-species cover crop, he got so frightened of the biomass,  he terminated it in February.  So in South Carolina, you know, things started to green up.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:54):**  But when his cover crop got to, I think, knee high, he really kind of got worried about  planting into that.  Jason farms in a coastal plain soil and he and I started a, he was one of five farmers,  
**[0:37:18-0:37:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18):**  I started a conservation innovation grant, a USDA grant with, and so he gave me 15 acres  along with four other farmers to look at.  And the idea over three years was that we would put multi-species cover crops in.  
**[0:37:37-0:37:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:37):**  And what we noticed was he had basically a corn-soybean rotation and we put cool season  cover crops in.  I think four species or basically four was rye, hairy vetch, crimson clover and daikon  
**[0:37:57-0:37:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:57):**  radish.  So when he harvested his corn, he would then plant that cover crop.  When he harvested his soybeans, he would do the same.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:07):**  Possibly the most important number that we have found there was that his organic matter  on that particular field went up from, went up about 60 to 70 percent.  So the numbers I'm remembering are about from 0.9 percent to 1.6 percent.  
**[0:38:28-0:38:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:28):**  So that was on a sandy coastal plain soil.  One of the other things that in that experiment that we noticed was that at the end of the  first growing season when we went back to do our soil tests, we noticed that Jason,  
**[0:38:54-0:39:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:54):**  the soil test phosphorescent potassium that I was assured would drop like a stone, we  noticed that the soil test phosphorescent potassium were almost identical to what they  were at the beginning of the growth or the previous year.  
**[0:39:13-0:39:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:13):**  So I went to my five farmers.  They each had gave me 10 to 15 acres and I said, how about we just don't fertilize this  year?  
**[0:39:24-0:39:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:24):**  So they trusted me.  I don't know why they trusted me.  They did.  
**[0:39:29-0:39:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:29):**  And this happened on all the other guys' farms.  But Jason hasn't had, he hasn't added phosphorus or potassium on this sandy coastal plain soil  for seven years.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:45):**  And we still see steady phosphorus and potassium soil test values.  Our organic matter has increased and our soil test pH has actually increased.  So his soil test pH is about 6.5 and 6.6.  
**[0:40:10-0:40:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:10):**  And typically he was adding lime every second year.  So just on those inputs, Jason has saved a lot of money.  He still, with his cover crop, and then he also adds manure every second year when he  
**[0:40:33-0:40:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:33):**  grows corn.  He puts 50 units of nitrogen on and when it rains, well, he gets 150 bushels of corn.  So conventional wisdom says to get 150 bushels of corn over here in this state, you have  
**[0:40:49-0:40:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:49):**  to add 150 plus another 20 pounds of nitrogen to the soil.  And we just haven't seen that.  So Jason's yields have stayed the same or they may be improving, but his input costs  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:03):**  have gone down.  His soil test values remain static on the P and K. And his calcium, not calcium, his  pH has stabilized as well.  
**[0:41:18-0:41:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:18):**  Pretty amazing benefits just from putting in some cover crops.  Right, right.  Well, you know, and someone would argue, well, what if we didn't put any cover crops?  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:26):**  And I'd say, yeah, I think, you know, that's really worth an experiment.  But imagine what the implications would be is then does that mean the soil science of  all those previous years was wrong in any case?  
**[0:41:41-0:41:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:41):**  So we attribute those stabilizing to cover cropping and certainly adding the chicken  litter every second year, I would also imagine helps.  He puts one to two tons a year every second year on.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:00):**  What is the potential cons to cover cropping?  Because there's got to be people who are saying like, I'm just not going to do that.  Is it the worry that they're going to spend the money on the seed and not get the return  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:11):**  on the money?  Like, is there a risk of doing it?  And why wouldn't you do it, I guess is what I'm asking.  
**[0:42:19-0:42:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:19):**  Yeah.  Let me just add one other thing on Jason's thing.  And then let's circle back to that question is we have noticed infiltration increases.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:29):**  And so whenever we have a five inch rainstorm, the water runs off from his neighbors and  basically infiltrates into his land.  So every drop of rain that Jason gets essentially stays on his farm.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:46):**  Now when we get excess runoff, that is a problem.  But that's also got to do with everything that's upland.  But when you have a raindrop, even a one to two inch storm on his property, it's going  
**[0:43:03-0:43:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:03):**  to sink straight in.  Okay, so circling back, can you just ask that question again?  Yeah.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:11):**  People hear that all the benefits of cover crops is pretty amazing.  It almost feels like a free lunch in a way.  What yet not everybody's doing cover crops.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:22):**  What are some of the reasons you hear farmers say I'm not going to do it?  Is it the worry I'm going to spend the money on the seed, spend the time, plan it and I'm  not going to get the return?  
**[0:43:30-0:43:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:30):**  Okay.  Well, the funny answer, the funny and silly answer is that you lose tractor tires because  you have a lot of deer antlers in the field.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:41):**  So your tractor tire consumption does go up.  One of the objections is that this is just an added cost.  And then there's no thought given to some of those benefits because I think farmers  
**[0:43:58-0:44:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:58):**  have been inculcated to believing that if you cut back on any kind of chemical inputs,  you're going to have a disaster on your hand.  So if you're a farmer and you're not penciling in a profit and then you're being told by  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:21):**  somebody with a funny accent like me that cover crops are going to help you, you're  saying the guy's lost his nuts, he's lost his marbles because he's asking me to spend  $30 on seed, an acre on seed and then I still got to drill it in.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:39):**  And then what do I do in terms of terminating the cover crop and planting into it?  So it would be the added expense.  I think the other concern many farmers have had and it's been met with so much YouTube  
**[0:44:55-0:45:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:55):**  stuff is how do I plant into 10,000 pounds of residue?  Because when that cover crop, warm season cover crop, cool season cover crop gets up  to about shoulder height, you know you've got about 10 or even 18,000 pounds, dry pounds  
**[0:45:14-0:45:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:14):**  per acre of residue.  How do you plant into that?  So there are a lot of guys who plant in green, some of them terminate and so there's a lot  
**[0:45:23-0:45:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:23):**  of back and forth on that.  But planting into it is another problem.  I think farmers are also told that you get green bridging and I don't disagree with this,  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:38):**  is that sometimes you get pest carryover.  So for instance, there may be certain cover crop species that are hosts to nematodes for  example and they will carry those across.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:57):**  I'm not an expert on that so there's only anecdotal evidence that I have.  But you know I've seen in some cases that where we had a crimson clover, we did see  in the following corn crop, we did see spiral nematodes in our field.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:21):**  But I went to another farm that had an active growing crimson clover cover crop and I looked  there and I didn't find any.  So you know the juries, as far as I'm concerned, the jury's out.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:36):**  But again I think I've had to learn that I shouldn't be dismissive and you know my stance  was always, you know if you've got multi-species cover crops out there, nature is going to  take care of herself and I don't think that's always the case.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:53):**  I think we've got to be very intelligent about choosing cover crops.  But I'm not always sure exactly where that goes.  I often trust what the farmers I work with see, you know what they see and then I kind  
**[0:47:09-0:47:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:09):**  of try and confirm, you know try and collect evidence that either confirms or refutes a  particular hypothesis that they have.  But if you go back it's going to be that added expense and how do I plant into that and then  
**[0:47:26-0:47:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:26):**  the disease.  Yeah because if you adhere to your base principle number one, that's no tillage or minimum  disturbance, you got to do a roller crimp, it's got to just die off seasonally and then  
**[0:47:40-0:47:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:40):**  you are left with all that residue which I guess also mimics principle number five.  I mean that is essentially the animal grazing.  I get you're missing the urine, the dung, all the other microbes that the animals bring  
**[0:47:51-0:47:55](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:51):**  but at least you're getting the quote, you know, trample that a livestock would bring  only you're bringing it in with diesel fuel.  Yeah, I'm not sure if I agree with you on that fifth principle but yeah, you know I  
**[0:48:06-0:48:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:06):**  think most of the farmers I work with still work with herbicides.  So you know they're going to go over it and terminate that.  I think the holy grail for many of us is how are we going to be able to terminate our cover  
**[0:48:21-0:48:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:21):**  crops without herbicides and especially when you've got multi species cover crops with  different maturation dates.  So but there is, I don't know if you've ever heard of a Phillips Harrow.  
**[0:48:40-0:48:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:40):**  There are a few of the farmers that I work with that want to save their grain drills  so they go ahead and spread their cover crop out.  You know usually it's a 30 to 40 foot pattern and they run over it with the Phillips Harrow  
**[0:48:55-0:49:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:55):**  and so this is on a crop that's been harvested and that looks like a herd of bison have just  gone over it.  So Phillips Harrow, I don't know if you've ever seen one of them, but it doesn't actually  
**[0:49:15-0:49:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:15):**  penetrate the soil but you'd have to look it up because I'm going to not be able to  describe it but when you pull it along you can pull it along at 10 miles an hour and  you could have Phillips Harrows between 30 and 40 foot wide and they just disturb the  
**[0:49:34-0:49:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:34):**  surface of the soil and they tend to give you the seed to soil contact.  In that case the process of planting the cover crop may to some extent emulate hoof action  of animals.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:54):**  Yeah and looking at one for people listening it almost looks like a spiked rod, a rod with  a bunch of spikes, almost like a roll brush that somebody would use to brush out their  hair, a cylindrical tube, a bunch of rods sticking out that rolls, pokes the soil.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:08):**  What I found with farmers who have sort of committed wholeheartedly to cover crops, I've  got a farmer who has 6000 acres and so he's got 1700 acres usually in the fall or usually  he's dealing with about 1700 acres that he's either planting or putting in cover crops.  
**[0:50:31-0:50:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:31):**  He can probably put about 200 acres of cover crop in with his Phillips Harrow whereas you're  not going to do that with the grain drill.  You're using a little bit more cover crop seed but you're saving a lot of time and if  
**[0:50:47-0:50:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:47):**  timeliness is something that's important and often with farmers it is, that saves a terrific  amount of time.  Given your chemical engineering background and chemistry background do you have any thoughts  
**[0:51:05-0:51:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:05):**  on this?  Definition of cover crops with an herbicide, is there any sort of comparison in terms of  the soil on a herbicide terminated cover crop versus in an organic system which uses say  
**[0:51:22-0:51:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:22):**  a mechanical means to terminate that same cover crop?  In other words are the soil microbes being affected at all in your studies?  Have you seen anything like that by that herbicide?  
**[0:51:35-0:51:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:35):**  Right, I've not done any sort of comparisons.  If you'd have asked me five years ago I would have said that tillage is always more destructive  than herbicides.  
**[0:51:50-0:52:01](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:50):**  I spent two days with Dr. Don Huber out in Emporia, Kansas at Gail Fuller's field school  and I got the living daylight scared out of me as he spoke about Roundup and then all  the adjuvants that are part of it.  
**[0:52:12-0:52:26](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:12):**  I think we're in a world right now where we're dealing or we don't even know what some of  the unintended consequences are of some of these chemicals that we have many of them.  I believe Roundup is just the poster child but many of these things are chelators and  
**[0:52:40-0:52:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:40):**  like chelating a lot of the essential minerals that we have.  Francis Shabu Su wrote a book called Healthy Plants where he brought up a thing of trophobiosis  and basically his thing was that the chemicals that we're using and the excess nitrogen we're  
**[0:53:03-0:53:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:03):**  using actually just makes plants more tasty for pests because pests are essentially the  demolition crew and they come in and demolish plants that are unhealthy.  I also hear of anecdotal evidence that pest pressure now is way higher than it used to  
**[0:53:24-0:53:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:24):**  be.  It makes me think that gradually we have become used to systems that are so full of pesticides  and plants that are extremely unhealthy.  
**[0:53:44-0:53:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:44):**  So they're very unhealthy so what do we have to do?  Well they're attacked by pests.  What do we have to do?  
**[0:53:51-0:53:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:51):**  We have to spray them.  What does that do that lowers the photosynthetic activity in the plant which makes it more  susceptible to pest species.  
**[0:54:04-0:54:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:04):**  So I think we're in kind of a downward spiral there.  So again going back I don't have comparative numbers so I couldn't speak authoritatively  on that but I have a suspicion that our production agriculture system has moved us to more and  
**[0:54:27-0:54:35](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:27):**  more unhealthy soils and I don't know whether certain kinds of tillage systems and I know  this is sacrilege to my soil health brothers and sisters but you know are they tillage  systems that may be less destructive than some of the herbicides that we're using.  
**[0:54:49-0:54:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:49):**  So it's a question that I would have been absolutely on the side.  No we need to use herbicides because tillage is extremely damaging.  Now I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but I think there are unintended consequences  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:03):**  when we use herbicides and pesticides.  Do you think tillage should be more measured on a curve?  I hear a lot about no-till and one of the biggest gripes about no-till is people see  
**[0:55:19-0:55:24](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:19):**  small things like even maybe that Phillips Harrow and they'll say well that's tillage.  Yeah, yeah.  Well that's just not a hard definition and maybe you know obviously one if I till one  
**[0:55:32-0:55:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:32):**  inch into the soil that's going to be less destructive than if I mold board plow it 12  inches deep and really invert the soil.  So is there a curve of quote damage when it comes to tillage?  
**[0:55:46-0:55:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:46):**  Right.  I'm a complete agnostic on tillage.  I wouldn't be able to answer that.  
**[0:55:52-0:55:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:52):**  Again I heard on one of the John Kempf podcasts I wish I knew the name of the guy but he was  talking about certain kinds of tillage being worse than others and one of the things that  surprised me was he said you know when you've got tines that sort of tillage is less destructive  
**[0:56:11-0:56:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:11):**  than when you've got something like a disk system.  But again I'm a complete agnostic on tillage so I wouldn't be able to really tell you although  you know instinctively you know the moldboard plow if you're plowing stuff that might have  
**[0:56:34-0:56:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:34):**  been if you're body plowing and you're bringing it up I've seen guys that have done that and  their soils in this part are terrible.  You know they're bringing in sandy systems they're bringing that clay to the surface  
**[0:56:48-0:56:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:48):**  and when they bring the clay to the surface and it's left fallow for you know a few weeks  in the baking sun guess what happens to that clay it turns into pottery.  So they've got pottery on their land.  
**[0:57:02-0:57:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:02):**  So I'm not a big fan of tillage but I'm beginning to be a little bit worried about some of these  herbicides that we're using and I don't know what that solution is.  So ideally like you said the holy grail is a way to terminate cover crops, no tillage,  
**[0:57:23-0:57:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:23):**  no sprays.  Yeah and when you do that you're going to have to be judicious.  You know the best way to do that would be to find a cover crop that terminates easily  
**[0:57:34-0:57:41](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:34):**  and probably you know the best way you know I've been speaking to some organic hemp guys  and you know that they were really interested in soil health but their multi species cover  crop you know the rye might have died but the hairy batch carried on growing.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:51):**  So you know if we're going to do this well we would probably have to select a species,  make sure it matures on time and then when we mechanically terminate it, it all terminates  at the same time.  
**[0:58:06-0:58:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:06):**  So it is a holy grail.  I think Rodale Institute probably has a lot of research on that where they till every  third year for perennial weed species.  
**[0:58:19-0:58:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:19):**  What about this, given your growing apprehension around chemical sprays, herbicides, given  the reluctance to till, is planting a single species cover crop that terminates easily  mechanically better than multi species cover cropping that you don't know how to terminate  
**[0:58:43-0:58:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:43):**  and get your next crop in?  Yeah.  I don't know, I think I've probably got livestock supporters if they're listening, you know  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:58:52):**  they're going to say, you idiot, it's livestock.  When you bring livestock into your system, I think livestock often is going to help fix  a lot of those problems because livestock love things like Palmer amaranth as long as  
**[0:59:16-0:59:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:16):**  it's not too big.  To answer you, in terms of one system or the other, I just don't know.  I just don't know.  
**[0:59:27-0:59:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:27):**  But I suspect that if we're going to move this forward, we're going to have to think  about adding that livestock component.  What about in terms of the P and the K in the system?  
**[0:59:40-0:59:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:40):**  In a cover cropping system, you've gone through a couple case studies where the levels are  staying the same.  They're not dropping and we're not adding P and K into the system externally.  
**[0:59:53-0:59:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:53):**  The plants obviously need them biologically to perform.  Can you walk through the cycle of what is happening with that P and K in the soil that  it's being used by the plant when the plant needs it, when the plant's growing?  
**[1:00:07-1:00:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:07):**  The plant dies.  The P and the K aren't just going up to the sky and going away.  They're ending up back in the soil because if those measurements are staying the same  
**[1:00:17-1:00:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:17):**  or increasing, we're concentrating them in the soil.  How is the plant using them and then getting them back into the soil where those levels  stay the same or increase?  
**[1:00:26-1:00:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:26):**  Okay, yeah.  And let me just add, this is only my experience in coastal plain soils.  For instance, in the one thing where we were looking at the potassium concentrations, we  
**[1:00:41-1:00:50](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:41):**  did notice slow drops of soil test phosphorus over time, but we never saw phosphorus deficiencies.  Again, I think this goes back to get to your question.  I think this just goes back to harvesting sunlight.  
**[1:00:59-1:01:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:59):**  When we're harvesting sunlight with a cover crop, we then are accessing mineral nutrients  in the soil through root exudates and then through interactions with soil microbes.  Those mineral nutrients were not there or were not available in the past.  
**[1:01:22-1:01:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:22):**  The cover crop then grows up, it dies, and then some of those nutrients are passed on.  Potassium for instance is always in the inorganic form, and it goes back into the soil before  the plant dies or it actually just leaches out of the plant in the soil.  
**[1:01:39-1:01:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:39):**  So there are again many different methods.  But you also talk about the removal of things like nitrogen or at least phosphorus from  the system through grain removal.  
**[1:01:57-1:02:08](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:01:57):**  So we're seeing that removal, but we're seeing slow decreases in soil test P, but we haven't  yet seen in our situation soil test P deficiencies.  I know a few guys in North Dakota who haven't had added synthetics for over 20 years, their  
**[1:02:23-1:02:31](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:23):**  soil test values in that particular, especially something like P, have gone down to places  that would scare the dickens out of agronomists.  But their plant tissue P is just fine.  
**[1:02:39-1:02:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:39):**  And so I think we're seeing much more in nature, much more of a just in time system where the  P is mobilized when it's needed from the minerals in the soil.  And the only way you can mobilize that is through improving your soil biology.  
**[1:02:58-1:03:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:58):**  Do you think the idea of looking at plant tissues is something maybe more farmers should  embrace to see what's actually in the plants when they're growing that whole just in time  system if it's pulling?  
**[1:03:09-1:03:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:09):**  Your soil test may not show it, but the plants definitely going to show it when it's mid  growth and then you're going to know, am I short on it?  Do I have it?  
**[1:03:17-1:03:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:17):**  Maybe I'm all good.  Yeah.  A year ago, I would have said absolutely yes, because this is how I've weaned to some of  
**[1:03:27-1:03:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:27):**  the farmers that I work with on fertilizer because we went in and we found, for instance,  I think in sort of 2015 to 2017, where we stopped applying phosphorus fertilizer, we  had two out of 500 deficiencies in phosphorus.  
**[1:03:49-1:03:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:49):**  And that was on corn in the early part of the season.  We went back the next week and those deficiencies were no longer there.  We did the same with potassium, where we found that plant potassium was up and down, not  
**[1:04:06-1:04:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:06):**  based on what the supply was, but was based more on what the weather was.  So I think it's a good report card.  But what I've become more aware of more recently is that a plant may experience a particular  
**[1:04:24-1:04:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:24):**  deficiency or you might see those symptoms of a particular deficiency in the plant leaves  or roots, but the plant tissue test comes back just fine.  And what I'm to understand is that some of the minerals in that plant tissue may be chelated  
**[1:04:47-1:04:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:47):**  inside the plant tissue itself.  So therefore, while it's inside the plant tissue, it may not be available to that system.  I think plant tissue tests are of limited use in terms of maybe weaning ourselves off  
**[1:05:10-1:05:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:10):**  some of the high input numbers that we're used to.  But the newer sort of buzzword, and I haven't done any of this, is looking at plant SAP  analysis rather than the plant tissue analysis and beginning to take a deeper dive in those  
**[1:05:29-1:05:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:29):**  especially maybe looking at a differential between your newer growth and your older growth.  So I think these are useful going back.  Plant tissue tests are probably useful, especially in your gross macronutrients, to kind of reassure  
**[1:05:50-1:06:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:50):**  you that you're not sort of hurting yourself when you grow your crops.  But probably plant SAP analysis may be a little bit more precise.  With the row crop farming guys that I work with, probably in the final analysis, it's  
**[1:06:13-1:06:18](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13):**  maybe the farmer's eyes that tell us the most.  In the past, I've said, don't worry, it'll all work itself out.  And I think more and more I need to start trying to understand maybe some of the visuals  
**[1:06:29-1:06:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:29):**  that we're seeing in crops and being able to say, well, that does look like a boron  deficiency.  Let's use some kind of foliar fertilization.  
**[1:06:39-1:06:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:39):**  How do you see foliar fertilization fitting in to this?  If the soils are healthy, working, that mineral pump is going, powered by the sun, where does  foliar feeding come in?  
**[1:06:52-1:06:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:52):**  Are you just doing what now you used to do to the soil where you used to just add stuff  to the soil?  Now we're going to put it on the plant instead?  
**[1:07:01-1:07:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:01):**  Right, right.  Well, remember your foliar fertilization, you're using orders of magnitude less.  And it's less about the NPK that you're putting out there.  
**[1:07:15-1:07:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:15):**  It's probably going to focus on some of the micronutrients and a little bit of phosphorus  and small amounts of nitrogen.  But what I understand about foliar fertilization is that your uptake in the plant is much higher.  
**[1:07:30-1:07:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:30):**  So the advantage might be that you can supplement the nutrients in a crop and the supplementing  of those nutrients in a crop in a system that might still be on its way to getting better  would be useful and profitable.  
**[1:07:51-1:07:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:51):**  I don't know how useful and profitable it would be in row crops where commodity prices  are really awful right now.  So I think theoretically we can address some nutrient shortfalls through foliar spraying,  
**[1:08:10-1:08:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:10):**  but I think the question is, you know, is there a benefit, especially when commodity  prices are terrible?  With your chemistry background, what might be the benefits of foliar feeding over root  
**[1:08:27-1:08:28](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:27):**  feeding?  Part of me is saying, well, the roots are designed to uptake nutrients.  Why am I not soil drenching these micronutrients versus foliar feeding them through a leaf,  
**[1:08:39-1:08:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:39):**  which has some ability to take in nutrients, but it can't be as effective as a root or  is it as effective?  What are your thoughts on that?  
**[1:08:47-1:08:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:47):**  What do you know on that?  What your intuition tell you?  Well, again, foliar feeding very, very much smaller amounts.  
**[1:08:57-1:09:05](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:57):**  But the uptake in the plant leaves can be much quicker.  So foliar feeding may more be in the line of correcting over time.  But I have to say I'm still really in kindergarten to be able to really address this.  
**[1:09:17-1:09:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:17):**  I think foliar feeding also probably, you know, you're going to have to do it every  10 to 14 days.  So go back and back and back.  
**[1:09:25-1:09:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:25):**  And that's where I think the profitability or the cost benefit analysis has to be looked  at.  But again, you know, this is only something I've entertained sort of since the beginning  
**[1:09:36-1:09:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:36):**  of this year.  So I'm definite, you know, you'll have to ask other people who understand foliar feeding  a lot better than me.  
**[1:09:48-1:09:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:48):**  If we go back to those five base principles, minimize soil disturbance, keep a cover, keep  a root in the ground.  If it was possible with a row crop, and a lot of people listening to this, they're not  
**[1:10:01-1:10:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:01):**  necessarily growing row crops.  I know you have a lot of experience with row crops.  They're growing smaller crops of vegetables.  
**[1:10:08-1:10:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:08):**  Do you see a system where if I could grow a perennial type cover crop, keep that in  the soil all the time and grow that alongside of my cash crop, that that is kind of your  dream system where there's maybe not 365 all year round, depending on where you live, but  
**[1:10:29-1:10:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:29):**  for the majority of the year, you have that cover crop in there, you have the cash crop  in there.  They're both growing symbiotically.  
**[1:10:35-1:10:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:35):**  And the cover crop, you're not necessarily worried about terminating it.  You're just more worried about keeping it alive so that carbon pump is working and the  microbes are feeding off of it.  
**[1:10:44-1:10:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:44):**  Yeah, yeah.  I know of at least one instance where that in fact happens, there's a few guys in Georgia,  one guy I specifically met, and he had a crimson clover cover crop.  
**[1:10:59-1:11:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:59):**  And I think he's added a little bit of white clover in that.  And he essentially stripped hills into that crimson clover.  And his corn and cotton then come up in that strip.  
**[1:11:14-1:11:21](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:14):**  And by the time the strip closes with the clover cover crop, his crop is well on its  way.  So I think those systems are definitely something one should aim for.  
**[1:11:32-1:11:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:32):**  I think Elaine Ingham was doing some work with a bunch of different people on looking  at natural ground creeping cover, natural plants like pony's foot that typically sat  on the ground and covered the ground and then putting cash crops in between those.  
**[1:11:54-1:11:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:54):**  So that certainly is another way to do it.  If you're not spending money on cover crops, how cruel would that be?  What about nature's cover crops?  
**[1:12:07-1:12:09](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:07):**  What about weeds?  There is this huge idea in ag that weeds are bad.  They don't fit into the system.  
**[1:12:17-1:12:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:17):**  And if you have low growing weeds, like a purslane or something like that that's at  the low and you're growing corn where you're harvesting way above it, do you see any sort  of competition or is that a wrong that is just kind of came up through ag where those  
**[1:12:35-1:12:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:35):**  weeds need to be removed because they're not stealing nutrients away from the crop and  maybe they're making the system better.  What are your thoughts on weeds coexisting with cash crops?  
**[1:12:45-1:12:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:45):**  Have you ever seen this book, Managing Weeds Without Poisons by Charles Walters?  I think I've heard of that one.  I have not read that one.  
**[1:12:55-1:12:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:55):**  I think he's the founder of Acres USA.  And then of course he refers to other things.  And really what Charles Walters says is that weeds tell us about, they speak to us about  
**[1:13:09-1:13:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:09):**  what's happening in the soil.  So going back to your question about purslane, something that would be a ground, a natural  ground cover theoretically in between corn, I don't see would be a problem.  
**[1:13:24-1:13:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:24):**  I think it's a question of us learning how to understand weeds again or weedy species  and they're there typically as a symptom of what's happening in the soil.  I don't know that we should be just leaving weedy species out there if we're say doing  
**[1:13:47-1:13:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:47):**  row crops.  But I think the definition of a weed is a plant out of place was something that allowed  the development of chemicals or not allowed, but justified the development of chemicals.  
**[1:14:05-1:14:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:05):**  And I think the better we understand weedy species and what they're telling us, the better  we're going to be able to manage them.  Again if we have cows, that's not a problem.  
**[1:14:17-1:14:23](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:17):**  I would be hesitant to tell my row crop farmers just to leave the weeds going.  One of the things that we have in the southeast would be henbit and chickweed, which are not  very, so there's a big argument, oh, just let the henbit and chickweed grow.  
**[1:14:36-1:14:38](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:36):**  And we can terminate that.  And when you terminate those, there's basically nothing left.  They just meld into the soil.  
**[1:14:47-1:14:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:47):**  I'm not a great fan of them because they don't provide that much biomass and they don't provide  much ground cover either.  But I would not rule out being able to look at some of the natural quote unquote weedy  
**[1:15:02-1:15:10](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:02):**  species that we have and see how do we fit those into our systems.  And I've tended to be maybe a little bit narrow minded on your conventional cover crop species  without going into say what someone like Charles Walters has been talking about 50 years ago.  
**[1:15:24-1:15:29](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:24):**  And you have that book by Charles and I think some people look at that with an ag and they  say that's pseudoscience, it's a bit woo woo.  What's the current feeling or understanding in academia from your perspective of weeds?  
**[1:15:40-1:15:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:40):**  Are they a plant out of place or do we have any sense of when weeds show up, this is why  this particular weed is here?  Yeah.  
**[1:15:51-1:15:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:51):**  Well, keep in mind, I'm not from an agricultural school.  I'm from a school of public health, so I come at it from a slightly different angle.  I'm also not an ecologist, but if we had a more ecological understanding of weeds, I  
**[1:16:11-1:16:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:11):**  think that's going to be better for the farmer and the environment.  If we have a purely production ag related focus on weeds, that weeds just need to be  gotten out of the way and we need to grow our crops to the maximum yield at all expenses,  
**[1:16:31-1:16:44](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:31):**  including of the farmer, and that's a Wendell Berry quote, then it's a whole different thing.  I think a lot of it, again, this is just my thinking, a lot of it is just basically driven  by money.  
**[1:16:52-1:17:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:52):**  You don't sell product if you say, well, let's figure out how we can work with mother nature,  what plants are going to work with us and how does this work?  It just doesn't sell product.  
**[1:17:08-1:17:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:08):**  That goes to herbicides, pesticides, chemicals.  I'm not anti the use of fertilizers and things like that, but I think the scientific questions  that have been asked often are skewed towards what would make the industry more money.  
**[1:17:37-1:17:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:37):**  If you observed anything anecdotally from maybe farms you visited, Gabe Brown, some  place like that where somebody has done a long term of no till, min till, cover crops,  they've really built up healthy soils.  
**[1:17:54-1:18:00](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:54):**  Have you ever seen a correlation where you could say, this soil looks better, it looks  less weedy to me?  Oh, yeah.  
**[1:18:04-1:18:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:04):**  We see that all the time.  I've been fortunate in that I work in South Carolina, South Dakota.  I've been to Idaho, Colorado.  
**[1:18:19-1:18:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:19):**  So number one, it's much easier for me to see and to touch and to smell and to say whether  soil is healthy or not.  And so you've got people like Brendan Rocky, for instance, who is in Colorado and he farms  
**[1:18:39-1:18:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:39):**  potatoes, but he doesn't only farm potatoes.  He will rotate that out every three years with quinoa.  But not only that, he also has a cover crop that he grazes and not only that, he's going  
**[1:18:53-1:18:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:53):**  to put companion crops in it.  And so, you know, Brendan doesn't really have much of a weed problem.  You know, he probably does.  
**[1:19:02-1:19:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:02):**  He does elect to use herbicides if he needs to.  But in his system, weeds are less of a problem.  The guys in the southeast that I work with, that's in South Carolina and then North Carolina  
**[1:19:19-1:19:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:19):**  and Georgia, the guys who've been cover cropping and have been experienced in this a long time.  Palmer amaranth, which is just a huge problem in conventional fields.  Palmer amaranth is just not a problem to these guys.  
**[1:19:34-1:19:42](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:34):**  Jason Carter, I think, usually now he handweeds most of his fields of Palmer amaranth.  So the answer is yes, you can actually see in long term systems or not even long term  systems, but systems where you just start keeping the soil covered, your cover crops  
**[1:19:53-1:19:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:53):**  are going to outcompete a lot of the weeds that were absolutely pests in your system.  Do you think it's a now competition or do you think it's the biology has fixed the mineralogy  and the weeds aren't trying to rectify a problem because the problem isn't there if we believe  
**[1:20:14-1:20:19](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:14):**  this concept that weeds heal specific things in the soil?  Yeah, the answer is yes.  There's both competition, but there's also evidence that in soils that become more and  
**[1:20:29-1:20:32](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:29):**  more healthy.  Remember for the most part, weedy species, Elaine Ingham has talked about a much more  helpful definition rather than a plant out of place.  
**[1:20:44-1:20:54](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:44):**  These species are going to be typically small early successional plants that grow very quickly,  produce a lot of seeds and then die.  So their interest, if you would want to use that word, is not in generating these mycorrhizal  
**[1:21:06-1:21:14](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:06):**  relationships that are usually a characteristic of later successional plants and perennials.  Their interest is in growing really, really, really quickly and then producing seed and  getting out for the next cycle.  
**[1:21:23-1:21:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:23):**  And what happens is when you get more and more soil structure, more and more mycorrhizal,  higher fungal to bacterial ratios is that the seed no longer is stimulated to actually  germinate.  
**[1:21:44-1:21:49](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:44):**  And so it will only germinate if the soil gets disturbed or compressed or compacted  or waterlogged or something like that.  So I think soil condition, not only in terms of your fungal to bacterial or your microbial  
**[1:21:59-1:22:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:59):**  relationships, but I think there's also evidence that, for instance, soil that have very, very  high soluble calciums really disfavoured the growth of weedy species.  Yeah, it's really interesting.  
**[1:22:15-1:22:16](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:15):**  Pardon me?  I was just going to say, it's really interesting when you think about that whole succession  and all the interconnected relationships between the mycorrhizal fungi.  
**[1:22:25-1:22:30](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:25):**  And I was talking to someone else and they were looking at weeds saying they might not  form those relationships with mycorrhizal fungi under the soil, but a lot of weedy species  might form fungal relationships on their leaves because they're early inhibitors or they're  
**[1:22:40-1:22:43](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:40):**  more picking up those types of nutrients.  That's interesting.  Yeah, I've never heard of that.  
**[1:22:46-1:22:52](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:46):**  Yeah, you know, I've got some pigweed in my strawberry patch, which is very fungal, but  the pigweed is kind of really pathetic looking.  You know, I don't know if it's going to set seed or anything.  
**[1:22:58-1:23:06](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:58):**  So yeah, so but, you know, I think it's in terms of a helpful definition of saying weeds  are early successional habitat plants.  And my general experience is that if we create the soil conditions and then the above ground  
**[1:23:15-1:23:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:15):**  conditions as well, those seeds, you know, if you have something covering the soil, if  there's no sunlight getting to that seed and there's no heavy disturbance of that land,  there's no stimulus for that seed to germinate.  
**[1:23:31-1:23:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:31):**  To germinate, right, right.  You know, shifting gears a little bit here, organic matter and its ties to cation exchange  capacity.  
**[1:23:42-1:23:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:42):**  Cation exchange capacity is another one of those things on a soil test.  People see it.  I'm not sure they fully understand it.  
**[1:23:48-1:23:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:48):**  From a chemical background, how would you explain that to somebody and how does that  tie into increased organic matter and improving soils having a different cation capacity,  cation exchange capacity compared to a soil that's poor?  
**[1:24:05-1:24:12](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:05):**  Yeah, well, in your soil test, keep in mind that cation exchange capacity is actually  a calculation based on your soil test, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium.  So that's actually if you it's just a formula based on those three things.  
**[1:24:27-1:24:37](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:27):**  And then it also not assumes that you're also looking at those are your base.  Those are your base cations.  You also have acid cations being the H plus, the aluminum and then iron.  
**[1:24:46-1:24:48](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:46):**  I think those are the main ones.  But essentially, theoretically, cation exchange capacity is how many cations, so cations being  those ions with positive charges.  
**[1:25:02-1:25:11](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:02):**  How many cations can a soil particle grab onto most soil particles have a negative charge?  And usually this is related to clays.  In our part of the world, we have one to one clays which are not really we don't have very,  
**[1:25:22-1:25:25](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:22):**  very high cation exchange capacity.  So we would have in the region of I think four, typically four to seven milliequivalents  per 100 milligram.  
**[1:25:34-1:25:40](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:34):**  When you go up into the corn belt, you might have 20 to 27.  The kicker about organic matter is that organic matter has a much higher cation exchange capacity.  So it's got lots more negative sites on it that will hold on to these cations.  
**[1:25:56-1:26:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:56):**  And my understanding is that organic matter typically for a pound of organic, basically  the cata, if you had pure organic matter, the CECs are closer to 300.  So it stands to reason that when you start adding 10, 20,000 pounds of organic matter,  
**[1:26:17-1:26:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:17):**  one percent of organic matter is going to be roughly 20,000 pounds of organic matter  in the top six inches of your soil.  When you add that amount of organic matter, it stands to reason that your CECs will increase.  
**[1:26:40-1:26:46](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:40):**  What we've seen in systems where we, for instance, have not put lime is we've actually seen our  CECs drop, even though the organic matter has gone up by one to two percent.  So theoretically, CECs should be increasing.  
**[1:27:00-1:27:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:00):**  But because it's based on a calculation of your soil test, calcium, magnesium, potassium  and sodium, I don't know that it always specifically reflects CECs.  And I know if you add lime to your system, you're going to artificially raise that CEC  
**[1:27:19-1:27:27](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:19):**  if you're capturing that high volume of calcium in your soil test.  More calcium in your soil test is not a bad thing.  But we just have to be, I'm not enough of an expert of CECs, but I am aware that it's  
**[1:27:36-1:27:45](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:36):**  a calculation and one has to be careful of it and use it as a general rule of thumb and  be just a little bit aware of it.  One thing I'm trying to do through this series is encourage people to do more experimenting  
**[1:27:54-1:27:59](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:54):**  and try stuff and then know why they're doing what they're doing, not just accept, like  off a soil test, I should add this.  Why should you add it?  
**[1:28:02-1:28:03](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:02):**  What's actually going on?  And to try and get people to be more citizen scientists.  When you have something like your results with the Johnson-Sue Bioreactor, when you  
**[1:28:15-1:28:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:15):**  like the system, when you probably fundamentally think, hey, this makes sense, yet you don't  get results that line up, how do you tackle that?  What advice do you have for somebody who believes in something and wants to try something, then  
**[1:28:29-1:28:33](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:29):**  they do it and it's just kind of like, well, I got a nothing burger here.  Well, farmers, you know, good innovative farmers like to fail at least once a year.  I think it's just a question of persistence.  
**[1:28:44-1:28:53](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:44):**  And part of that might just be because you have a mindset that says, OK, well, that didn't  work.  It's not because David Johnson's system is not good, but it's something that I may or  
**[1:29:02-1:29:04](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:02):**  may not have done in my system.  You know, I followed the recipe in my case.  I followed the recipe.  
**[1:29:11-1:29:17](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:11):**  You know, looking back, sorry, I'm diverting.  But I think it's just a question of persistence and understanding that if you meet with a  lack of success in something, you know, it's back to the drawing board.  
**[1:29:33-1:29:39](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:33):**  It's rethinking through what could have gone wrong.  Just to answer your question earlier on, you know, it might be that for me, I was taking  beneficial microbes and putting them into a system where they didn't really have a great  
**[1:29:57-1:29:58](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:57):**  habitat.  I would have thought it was a good habitat because it's a soil that's getting healthy,  but they might have gone out there and, you know, subsisted off a little bit of milk and  
**[1:30:09-1:30:13](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:09):**  molasses that I gave them and then they died right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  
**[1:30:15-1:30:22](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:15):**  I think that's one thing a lot of people, they don't fully think through and I'm totally  guilty of this is a lot of this stuff is contextual.  Like it might work great in one particular biome, but as you know, from working in aquatic  
**[1:30:32-1:30:36](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:32):**  systems, working with soil, there are some universal principles, minimum tillage, but  not everything that works in South Carolina is going to work in California is going to  work in Maine because those soils, the climates are inherently different and you just got  
**[1:30:46-1:30:51](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:46):**  to try and take what you know works and maybe there has to be subtle adaptations to get  it to work in your system.  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[1:30:55-1:30:56](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:55):**  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Well, Buzz, I want to thank you for taking some time to come on and share everything  
**[1:31:01-1:31:02](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:01):**  that you're doing today.  For people that want to learn more about the work that you're doing, you have a podcast,  you do consulting, if they want to follow along and learn more about you, where can  
**[1:31:13-1:31:15](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:13):**  they go?  Well, the main place that we work in my labs at the School of Public Health is soil health  labs.  
**[1:31:28-1:31:34](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:28):**  So if you go to soil health labs, plural, on Facebook, you'll see some of the stuff  that we do.  We work with the USDA in South Carolina.  
**[1:31:40-1:31:47](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:40):**  We've got a project that we're doing with Washington, DC, that takes us to Idaho and  Colorado, and then we also, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.  Then we've also got a project that we've got with South Dakota called Maritor Myth.  
**[1:32:01-1:32:07](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:01):**  And we're thinking of changing that brand name, but if you follow Maritor Myth, we'll  be telling you where we're headed.  We're probably going to call it Growing Resilience.  
**[1:32:12-1:32:20](https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-08-BuzKloot-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:12):**  But the main place is to follow soil health labs and to follow some of the stuff that  I've done over the last few years.
